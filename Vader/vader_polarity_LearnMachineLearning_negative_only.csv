jjpuvmc,5,Seankala,5/11/2023 4:59,"MLE who's still new to industry (currently working on my first year of experience). I did my master's in CS before this with a focus on NLP.

What I think of ChatGPT is what everyone already knew: bigger LMs do better. The genius behind OpenAI is that they actually provided a UI and wrapped it as a service.

The value that ChatGPT provides (in my opinion) is that people no longer have to do extensive Google searches (most of the time). I can ask ChatGPT a question and just read the answer, then do minimal searching to verify the information. When I don't know what even to exactly Google, I just ask ChatGPT. I like to think of ChatGPT as the Xavier or He initialization of my Googling.

What I hate is all the hype. Everyone is an AI expert now. Or a frikkin ""prompt engineer"" (whatever tf that is). I worked in cryptocurrency back in 2017-2018 when the hype was also quite real. I hate it.",learnmachinelearning,0.047,0.894,0.058,-0.4215,Negative

You are arguing with me over a non-argument. You literally don't know what he said. He had no clue what AI even was, he didn't even know the term bias, weights or anything. He simply watched a shitty conspiracy YouTube video. That's everything. That's honestly all you can read out of my comment...  


I know that biology students can criticize AI. Everyone can. The knowledge is not only available to computer scientists.

&#x200B;

But there's a fine difference between manipulating inputs, feeding in false information and straight up saying ""Yea OpenAI sits there and tells ChatGPT to say THIS exact thing at THIS exact time"". That's not how AI works.

I honestly won't watch any of these videos, because I already watched enough about this topic. I know how bias works, because as I said: I'm literally working on AI!  


Just because the point of someone COULD be right it doesn't make their opinion valid if it's based on bs. Take this as an example:  


If someone says ""Man today is so fucking hot, we need to fight climate change"" ( I know this is a casual saying which doesn't need to be analyzed, but take this in the context of a political debate) he is basically right about the climate change part. But ""that the day is hot"" part isn't necessarily a consequence of it. Sometimes it's just weather. Climate is something entirely different with influence on weather. The conclusion is right, however the rest doesn't need to be true. Just because something CAN happen it doesn't mean that shitty conspiracies are true now.

&#x200B;

If you have any doubt that he was simply talking bullshit: He later said that we are able to open a wormhole for space travel. When I asked him to explain how a wormhole works he didn't have an answer. After I explained it to him he agreed to disagree. About a scientific fact...

The answer to OP's question as asked, is NO. It is not available to train.  GPT and other models are available.

If you KNOW you are only guessing, why comment in this manner? Or why start off with a negative?

>chatGPT is of 175 billion of parameters. Anything with that size already requires specially built architecture no individual could afford.

That wasn't the question OP is asking and is not relevant to the answer. OP seems to have a firmer grasp than you do. OP just did not know if ChatGPT was *also* available.

>not in the sense of retraining the model.

OP did not say retraining. No one says retraining.  Use proper terms if you are going to pretend to know what you are talking about.

GPT can be trained, the extra data stays in the cloud.  There are 1000's of companies and individuals training it and that have trained it, that is why you see so many websites (if looking) that have ""AI"" based tools.  Resume builders, PowerPoint builders etc..

There are three (probably more) ways to interact with GPT models other than just going to the wesbite

1. You act as a middle man, just sending prompts via API http
2. You prepare/prepend prompts specifically tailored to the desired output and complete with 1.
3. You train your own data to facilitate a wider and specific range of output and complete with 1, 2 and your key.

ChatGPT is a front facing product, it is not GPT4.  I would not know, but if I had to guess I would say ChatGPT will never be anything other than 1 and 2 with no ability to train.",learnmachinelearning,0.021,0.935,0.043,-0.6404,Negative

j6sxi5r,3,wind_dude,2/1/2023 12:48,"Okay, I was able to try the ChatGPT setting, I'm sorry, but I almost vomited.

&#x200B;

The editor lost all formatting for code. See is the VS modal you're using can support markdown.

&#x200B;

I suspect you are prompt engineering/appending prompts to the user input. This created extremely low quality spaghetti code, lacking any funcs, abstraction, or really usability. And it include inline comments for every line of code. This is not something chatGPT does with my prompt, it consistently produced usable code when prompted in chatGPT.

&#x200B;

For the chatGPT setting I would drop all attempts at your prompt engineering. This would certainly eliminate the low quality code issue. Also with the short term memory it's not necessary, if I as a user don't get what I want from ChatGPT I can ask it to correct  the output in human language.

&#x200B;

So in summary:

\- drop the attempt at prompt engineering for chatGPT option

\- correctly format code in returned responses

\- nice to have: send code to editor from prompt modal. For now just insert it in where the user clicked in the editor. Long term see if you can send imports to the appropriate place (but mark/highlight them).",learnmachinelearning,0.067,0.842,0.092,-0.5286,Negative
