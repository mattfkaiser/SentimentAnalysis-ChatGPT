I'm still learning as you are but I'm at the second year of my master degree in computer science and I have to say that since the thing came out I used it heavily to study things and try to understand them.
For me there is no urge to use chatGPT for two reasons:

1) Unless the thing you are trying to understand is in the realm of ""specific but there is something written about it on a website or a text somewhere"" its reply will be bad ad best, it can also be completely made up.
I have seen a friend generating Go code with GPT and it invented library functions that didn't exist.

2) For the love of christ it writes wrong code.

jnna6gh,3,mandzeete,2023-06-10 07:25:54,"So I work as a software developer and I gave ChatGPT a chance. Here are my findings:

* it's ""knowledge"" is limited to information up to September 2021. Anything that concerns me after that date is unreachable for ChatGPT. May it be library changes, newest vulnerabilities affecting my projects, tech news, etc.
* it's ""knowledge"" is limited in general. When I ask about something specific from before September 2021 then it is not guaranteed it was trained on such data. For testing purposes I asked about CVE-2021-33790 (a vulnerability from May 2021). ChatGPT did not have an answer. Also it told me that its previous version GPT-3 (year 2020) was trained on terabytes of data while the size of the Internet was 64 zetabytes. Which is 64.000.000.000.000 times less than what the GPT-3 was trained on. So only a very small fraction of data reached ChatGPT. Even if we assume the current versions GPT-3.5 (the free version) and GPT-4 (the paid version) are trained on much more data then it will still be a fraction.
* as it was trained on data from before September 2021 then some of its information is outdated. I once asked it for some information. It gave me an answer that I wanted to verify. So, I asked it to provide a reference from documentation to what it told me. It gave me a link. That link lead me nowhere. In 2023 that link did not exist. Also it leads me to the next point.
* It overconfidently suggests me an incorrect information. The link it gave me in the previous point, it has never existed. I used Wayback Machine to see to the previous versions of websites throughout the history and that link never existed in any version. So, ChatGPT only made up that link. And that is not the only case. There are more. It has time by time told me an incorrect information that it came up with.
* it did not have access to the whole Internet while being trained nor has right now. So it can't even check up information after its training period.

At best I can use it as another ""googling"" tool but I have to cross verify its information. So it is nowhere close in ""ruining"" me.

izmwyx3,7,PC-Bjorn,2022-12-10 02:50:39,"We can look at this more like an even higher level of programming. 

Originally, coders had to stamp holes in cardboard to trigger various instructions in the machine. This idea was first introduced by Charles Babbage in 1843, and I had family members who worked like this until up into the 1970's. 
  
The 12-bit ""PDP-8"" introduced in 1965 came with no software, but had 12 levers where you entered the various instructions and variables by flipping the levers, setting the 12-bit word, before submitting it.

Then we started seeing programming languages where you could ""just say what you want"" and the compiler will make machine code for you.

A basic web application or game today typically has hundreds of thousands of instructions and would be practically impossible to code with levers or punch cards. 

In the 80's and 90's you had to basically teach the machine what graphics are. You had to understand the trigonometry and math required to go from a table of 3D coordinates to adressing the one dimensional video memory of your computer. Making a game would often be 75% just setting up the engine at first, leaving little time for actually developing.

Today you can import three.js and start making 3D graphics in javascript with no experience and primary school math instead of university level. The library takes care of communication with your 3D GPU.

The internet is overflowing with libraries for setting up everything from databases and backend servers to front end kits, and cross platform SDKs are actually good now. The internet has set a new standard. Now, you don't have to code for the device. You code for the web, and the devices adapt.

Modern compilers, libraries and hardware has made coding so much more rewarding. What used to take years to develop can now be done in days.

Enter ChatGPT: With guidance from a human, it can speed up coding the same way compilers did with machine coding. It's really no different. It's just one more layer of abstraction, and you can always go deeper if needed.

What used to take days will now take minutes.

Look at how simple apps/games used to be.  
Look at how they've evolved with each innovation.  
Then think of how much more advanced and helpful they will be with the help of AI.

Now, go out there and learn how to be the AI master. You got this.

Someone who was new to Unity asked this question, and after I helped them troubleshoot it I thought it might be interesting to see if the bot could figure it out. 

The user had set up a simple looping 2D patrol for a character, running in update. If they used Vector2.lerp it stopped at the first patrol point, if it used vector3.lerp it disappeared from the camera during when approaching the second point but continued the loop. It was simple enough, Unity2d still has Z levels and a 3D environment, it just uses an orthographic camera and different collision logic to negate that (usually), the guy had put the 2nd patrol point at a z level behind the camera's clipping plane, so it disappeared when navigating the z level and when constrained to vector2 it was never able to match the position of the 2nd point.

This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as language translation, text summarization, and content generation. However, GPT-3 is not designed to be used as a learning tool. It does not have the ability to provide explanations or in-depth information about a topic, and it cannot interact with users in a way that supports learning. If you are looking for a tool to help you learn, I would recommend using other educational resources that are specifically designed for that purpose.

That's exactly what i've been doing the last two night. And that's why i pretty much wrote a single line of code yesterday (by myself) and kept trying to see if there wasn't other possible solution i'm unaware off that would be more elegant by bombarding chatGPT with question.

ChatGpt will try stuff with modules, functions and methods i haven't yet encountered yet. It's not teaching per see, it's showing things that exist. Copy pasting will not teach you anything, messing with it and reading about what it shows you will.

It's more of an interactive search engine than teaching tool. What makes it a ""good"" tool in my book is that the proper documentation for python do exist and you can easily crosscheck it. Then, you can have it generate examples, lots of them and test them on your own to see how things work.

As an experiment, I just asked it ""What makes Python 3 backwards incompatible with Python 2?"" and got the following response:

> 1. Print statement is replaced by print() function: In Python 2, the print statement is used to print to the standard output, while in Python 3, the print() function is used.

> 2. Division operator: In Python 2, the division operator (/) behaves differently depending on the type of the operands. If the operands are both integers, it performs floor division, while if either operand is a float, it performs true division. In Python 3, the division operator always performs true division, regardless of the type of the operands.

> 3. Exception handling: In Python 2, the syntax for handling exceptions is different from Python 3. In Python 2, the except clause must specify the exception class, while in Python 3, it can specify the exception class or exception instance.

> 4. Unicode support: Python 3 has improved support for Unicode, with all strings being Unicode by default. In Python 2, Unicode support is optional and must be explicitly enabled.

Of those four bullet points, #1 is basically correct. #2 is *sort of* correct, but worded much too strongly -- in *both* Python 2 and 3, the result of the `/` and `//` operators depends (in general) on the types of the operands, and the only thing that was changed in Python 3 was the behavior for `int`s. #3 is totally wrong. And #4 is half-correct, but saying Unicode support is ""optional"" in Python 2 is very poor phrasing. You don't ""enable"" it; it's always enabled, and you *use* it by constructing `unicode` objects.

But yes, on daily use it becomes apparent that, in a sanitized environment with clear instructions, it can do some seemingly amazing things, however in the real world it's not nearly as powerful as it seems. 

I was in one of my debugging sessions and asked it something along the lines of ""how can I get this function to output this, right now it's output is this"". It gave a perfectly reasonably sounding improvement, as well as explained what the code was doing... except that the ""improvement"" it suggested was literally regurgitating my original function back with no changes.

Another time I asked: ""give me a set of input and output for caesar of hello, world from key = 1 to key = 26, format each input and output in the form of an array""

Here is the output it gave:

**Input: \[""hello, world""\]**

**Output for key = 6: \[""nkrrv, cuxjr""\]**  
**Output for key = 7: \[""olssw, dvyks""\]**  
**Output for key = 8: \[""pmttx, ewzlt""\]**  
**Output for key = 9: \[""qnuuy, fxamu""\]**  
**Output for key = 10: \[""rovvz, gybnv""\]**  
**Output for key = 11: \[""spwwa, hzcow""\]**  
**Output for key = 12: \[""tqxxb, iadpx""\]**  
**Output for key = 13: \[""uryyc, jbeqy""\]**  
**Output for key = 14: \[""vszzd, kcfrz""\]**  
**Output for key = 15: \[""wtaae, ldgsA""\]**  
**Output for key = 16: \[""xubbf, mehtB""\]**  
**Output for key = 17: \[""yvccg, nfiuC""\]**  
**Output for key = 18: \[""zwddh, ogjvD""\]**  
**Output for key = 19: \[""axeei, phkwE""\]**  
**Output for key = 20: \[""byffj, qilxF""\]**  
**Output for key = 21: \[""czggk, rjmyG""\]**  
**Output for key = 22: \[""dahhl, sknzH""\]**  
**Output for key = 23: \[""ebiim, tloaI""\]**  
**Output for key = 24: \[""fcjjn, umpbJ""\]**  
**Output for key = 25: \[""gdkko, vnqcK""\]**  
**Output for key = 26: \[""helpl, wordL""\]**

In the above output, every key from 3 to 26 is wrong, what clued me in was that, as we all know, at key 26 it should revert back to the original string. So I asked this as a follow up, ""give me the same but with key = 27"" and it gave me this gem:

**Sure, here's the input and output for the Caesar cipher of ""hello, world"" with a key of 27:**

**Input: \[""hello, world""\]**

**Output for key = 27: \[""hello, world""\]**

**Note that the key value modulo 26 is used to determine the actual shift applied in the Caesar cipher. In this case, a key value of 27 is equivalent to a key value of 1, so the output is the same as with key = 1.**

This was my first experience realizing that while it can retain some context, it doesn't seem to have ""knowledge"" of what it said before, if you know what I mean. It wasn't until I asked: ""why is the output of key = 27 the original string hello, world then"", that it corrected itself.

My personal opinion is that it's great as a reasoning aid, just don't let it do the thinking for you or trust anything it gives out completely.

I majored in music theory (and created software to replace the mouse and keyboard with any MIDI instrument). I teach programming one a week.

I think of the LLM as only being able to write syntax. However, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, THAT was â€œthe missing pieceâ€ to stress free coding.

Itâ€™s not that writing syntax is hard; It becomes muscle memory. Itâ€™s just bridges the gap from static analyzers, debuggers, and other QA tools to new code.

You do not need to position yourself between the QA tools and the LLMs; Stay out of that loop.

Iâ€™m sure that, based on your experience, you can see how to draft two functions (business logic and tests). The tests verify that the intent is communicated clearly.

Let the LLM argue with your QA tools. You get passing tests and perfect syntax (or you exit the loop and mark the errors for human review).

Itâ€™s really no different than running strict automated code reviews to guide human devs. And, assuming youâ€™ve done that, you can see how humans learn to write better code. 

In my experience (hiring offshore workers for decades) working with the LLM really feels like working with cheap devs from â€œthe country that shall not be namedâ€. ;)

In fact, I was developing a system to automatically manage cheap devs right before ChatGPT became popular. Now, I send the code to the LLM (before asking a human to correct code).

So what if the LLM outputs â€œlaughableâ€ code 33% - 50% of the time when you can automatically ignore it and loop (while you sleep)?!

I suggest you accept the fact that this particular teacher does not suit your teaching needs and you'll have to accept the fact that you need to compensate outside of class and put additional work in.

jdw7yro,-3,Outrageous_Neat_6232,2023-03-27 13:25:50,"I don't see how ChatGPT is lazy when I quoted the type of question I request from it. I'm aware it isn't 100% accurate, however I use it to explain a concept in the bigger picture with real world examples that i'm experienced in (food for example). Here's an example of what it gave me for loops (which we covered one example problem in class and moved on)

""Loops and do-while loops serve similar purposes, but they have different structures and execution flows. Let's illustrate the difference between a loop (using a for loop as an example) and a do-while loop in the context of food:  
Imagine you have a bowl of fruits, and you want to eat one fruit at a time until there are no fruits left in the bowl. Here's how you could represent this using a for loop and a do-while loop in pseudocode:  
For loop:  
bowl\_of\_fruits = 5  
for (count = 1; count <= bowl\_of\_fruits; count++) {  
eat\_fruit()  
}

  
Do-while loop:  
bowl\_of\_fruits = 5  
do {  
eat\_fruit()  
bowl\_of\_fruits = bowl\_of\_fruits - 1  
} while (bowl\_of\_fruits > 0)

  
In both cases, you're eating one fruit at a time until there are no fruits left in the bowl. However, the for loop uses a loop control variable (in this case, count) to iterate through the loop a specific number of times (equal to the number of fruits in the bowl). The loop condition is checked at the beginning, and if it's false, the loop won't execute even once.  
In contrast, the do-while loop executes the loop body at least once, regardless of the loop condition, because the condition is checked after the loop body has been executed. In this example, you'll eat a fruit first and then check if there are any fruits left in the bowl. If there are, you'll continue eating fruits until the bowl is empty.""

Iâ€™m convinced that the only reason professors do this is out of spite for students that donâ€™t give them the perceived respect that they believe they deserve by immortalizing every word they speak in class.

That said, there is a good reason that college courses tend to focus on teaching â€œhow to learnâ€ as opposed to concrete information, and that is that the languages, hardware, and libraries that we use to create software and digital content are constantly changing. If the sole purpose of your class was to teach you Java, that knowledge would only serve you so long until the language has undergone changes and you need to go relearn it, or until some other language wins over popularity. The skills that really make you into a tech person are less about specific knowledge and more about general understanding of the structures and logic that make computers work, and the ability to be continuously teaching yourself new technologies and adapting to new workflows. If that doesnâ€™t sound like an enjoyable existence, maybe IT/CS is not for you.

That they're calling it that doesn't mean that's what it is.

Like, there was the Go playing bot that was so good one of the best players who has lived quit the game after being beaten.  That bot can be beaten [by a moron who barely understands the rules](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7v5xb/a-human-amateur-beat-a-top-go-playing-ai-using-a-simple-trick) as long as the moron doesn't play to win Go, but plays to beat the Bot.  Because the Bot doesn't know what Go is, what the goal of the game is, what the game even is, it just knows that if it sees these patterns, do these patterns in response without any comprehension of what any of that means.

That's ChatGPT - stringing together sentences because they fit the pattern without having the first clue what any of it actually means.  A 2 year old has a better grasp of the meaning than the ""AI"" bots.

Because they aren't AI, they're Autopredict on steroids.  Same thing with the artbots - they don't *know* what any of the shit is, which is why you got the laughable errors of too many fingers or 180 individual abdominal muscles and so on.  Sure, those are getting rarer, but it still doesn't know what the hell you mean when you say ""Make me a sunset, but more peaceful"" other than to aggregate what it knows Sunset and Peaceful to mean.  

There's the Chinese Room philosophical experiment - I do think that it puts too much ""special"" on humans, and I do think that at some point we will have Bots that actually do understand the same way a 2 year old understands things.

We're also decades away from that, if not centuries.  Before we can make it, we first gotta figure out how the hell a 2 year old's brain works in the first place.  We don't even know how a rat's brain works.

The answer is ""**Yes, but a different kind of work - a better kind**"".

What ChatGPT (and other AIs) can do, is to create all the standard, basic ""pizza""-code that you build your application on. If you are creating a web-application, chances are that you are going to need a backend, store some data in a database, convert data-tables into objects, transfer those to the frontend through some REST-API, create a frontend to receive data, display data in lists, and create forms to edit those data. And that's before adding any business-logic to the application!

This is boring work, really repetitive, but not so repetitive that you can re-use code from earlier projects. Of course you have to learn how to do it, in order to ask ChatGPT to do it for you, and fix all the mistakes it makes - and that part of learning might seem a bit annoying, like learning multiplication-tables when you have a calculator. But once you get to use it actively, and can work on more interesting code, it will be amazing!

Some ""code-monkey""-jobs, where you only ever create this basic code, they are going to disappear, and the bootcamps that only teach to that level, they are going to close, or level up.

Because if you are not aware of what is possible and what is not then you can imagine all kind of weirdness. That I will hack you over your Reddit comment and what not.

Drive-by downloads in general do nothing. They do not get executed by themself. Either you have to click on them physically or your browser has to execute them by itself (which it does not do, except with cookies and cookies will not have such negative impact on your system).

Like really, don't overthink but just educate yourself on stuff. Fear caused by ignorance can just make things worse. But when you are aware of how stuff works then there will be less ignorance and also less fear.

Forget hacking servers. Unless you want problems with police and such. If anything then ONLY try stuff with your own things: your own router, your own web application you host from your own PC/laptop, your own web server running inside your own PC/laptop.

Most likely you are still in a high school. Better concentrate on finishing that. No point to push yourself and burn out and then fail both your high school and probably will not be accepted to a programming related job either.

Why are you opposing a college? Because of the fees/loans? There exist student loans. You'll pay it back in some years when you get hired as a Junior developer. I mean, if you can then definitely go for a college degree. Many times better than learning on your own, aimlessly. Right now quite a different things that you are having problems with, it would be solved by college courses. They teach programming, cyber security, AI, cryptography (more like during Master studies, though), Linux administration and many other things.

Take your time off and rest. Where are you rushing to? I started my college studies when I was 28. Sure, I could start earlier but because of BURNOUT I decided to postpone my college studies and do all the other stuff during these years. Kind of a wasted time, a bit. These years between finishing my high school studies and between starting my college studies. But all because of a BURNOUT. If I would take things easy, not rush, not go over my own limits, I would graduate high school with normal health and most likely would start my college studies also earlier.

ChatGPT is just a tool. Itâ€™s not going to replace anybody in itself. You still need a human to use and interpret itâ€™s results. 

If an employer needs a competent engineer - theyâ€™re gonna make sure theyâ€™re hiring someone who knows their stuff. It doesnâ€™t matter if Google exists or AI. 

Also, nobody can predict how AI will shape the future. True AI wonâ€™t exist likely in our lifetime or if itâ€™s even possible to begin with. 

So youâ€™re only hurting yourself by being scared to study algorithms because you think in 10 years youâ€™ll be replaced. It sounds to me more like youâ€™re too lazy to bother with algorithms because thereâ€™s a small chance you wonâ€™t need it in years. Thatâ€™s absurd.

It sounds like youâ€™ve never worked in an enterprise application. Adding features can be complicated and many many many times youâ€™ll have to write your own logic, as in your own algorithms to make the feature do what you intend it to. So youâ€™re only hurting your own programming skills. 

What do you think programming is if it isnâ€™t writing algorithms all the time? Algorithms arenâ€™t only to manipulate data. Itâ€™s a broad term that can apply in many areas where you try to achieve a result. Try adding a feature in an enterprise application with hundredths of files and dependencies and coupled code. AI canâ€™t do this. How would it know where to start looking?",learnprogramming,0.064,0.883,0.053,0.1824,Positive

1. You put all 300 prompts you want into separate lines in a text fine.

2. The program reads the lines of the file, and for each line-

   2.1 it gets the information from chat GPT via the API call using the prompt from the line it read in

   2.2 it appends the response to a text file

   2.3 it appends the hyperlink (constructed in step 2.1) to a CSV file

j79h1qk,1,Daddys_Lil_Grandpa,2023-02-04 21:35:45,"Thanks very much for your response. I'm not quite sure I undersand your example use-case with the country, state, city stuff. Are you saying that a pointwise additive approach is good because it accommodates data where you might be missing certain input fields sometimes? And you can just not add the embedding for that field, and still have a valid input to feed through your net (which wouldn't be possible if you were concatenating them)?

Secondly, was my question about the potentially ""loose/fuzzy"" nature of positional encodings a meaningful one, and did ChatGPT provide an adequate response?",learnmachinelearning,0.123,0.835,0.043,0.8053,Positive
j7gtziw,1,vannak139,2023-02-06 13:25:32,"As far as chatGPT goes, its answer is fine, I guess, perhaps a bit narrow. To simply say that positional encodings don't effect the semantics of word embeddings is fine to consider as True or False, but if you're going to say the semantics aren't effected you should probably focus on mentioning what does change, what improves, or else why even bother doing this? So its answer isn't foundationally wrong, just narrow. 



Point-wise addition is great in a lot of circumstances, that it deals with missing data is just a bonus. The best way to consider that specific benefit is considering how a ""missing data"" labels will have to work, compared to added embeddings. The critical thing is, even if you train a ""missing label"" embedding, it'll still be uniform across all unknown examples. With stacked embeddings, this won't necessarily be the case. However, point-wise addition of embeddings can be good even without any missing data. There's lots of perspectives that you can take on this, from considering how this effects the gradient, to how it deals with vector space mappings. Its difficult to pin down a single specific reason or condition where point-wise addition works.   


That said, I'm most often considering how the elements contribute to the semantics I think are reasonable, as well as the correlation between events- the qualities of the coincidence matrix. In the location sub-category type, you'd have a very very sparse co-incidence matrix between States and Cities, and I generally take this to imply that concatenating will not be viable. Adding is a good alternative here. Different embeddings, like Product Category and Location, seem more worthwhile to concatenate perhaps because their co-incidence matrix is relatively dense and higher population. I vaguely relate this to the number and diversity of samples each independent embedding vector is trained on. So you could train on D1xD2xD3xP1xP2, and have a very large low density space. Or, you could train on the space spanned by (D1+D2+D3)x(P1+P2), and have a smaller space with higher density, which probably helps generalization, i guess?",learnmachinelearning,0.143,0.795,0.062,0.9858,Positive

It's very hard to talk about something that is not observable.
Here's my personal take on the problem. I'd use the prompt below as ""system"" prompt with ChatGPT API.
