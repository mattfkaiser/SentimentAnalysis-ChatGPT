jjm42vc,9658,elusivehonor,5/10/2023 11:28,"People in here are giving really bad advice. 

The teacher does not seem unreasonable. They are using a tool that they may or may not know is ineffective at detecting, but probably was told to use by the faculty. ChatGPT has created issues with traditional assignments, and some people are cheating. Universities are trying to adapt to this change â€” donâ€™t panic. 

If you really didnâ€™t use AI, do NOT come across as hostile right off the bat, as it will set red flags. Immediately going to the Dean is not going to help you â€” that is such bad advice I canâ€™t even comprehend why someone would suggest that. The Professor is not trying to fail you; they are asking for an informal meeting to talk about the allegation. 

Explain to them that you did not use AI, and ask how you can prove it. Bring another paper you wrote, and tell them you have a Word editing history, if it you have it. Just talk with the professor  â€” they are not out to get you; they want you to succeed. They just want to ensure no one is cheating on their assignments. 

If and only if they are being unreasonable in the meeting, and seem determined to fail you (and you really didnâ€™t use AI), should you escalate it.",ChatGPT,0.103,0.777,0.12,-0.8515,Negative
jjnjsjh,39,ummcal,5/10/2023 16:57,"i copied your comment and the one above into chatgpt, including all residual reddit stuff....

In Microsoft Word, you can access version history if you have been working on the document in OneDrive or SharePoint. Here's how to do it:

Open your Word document.  
Go to the ""File"" menu.  
Click on ""Info.""  
Under ""Manage Document,"" click on ""Version History"" or ""Manage Versions.""

You will see a list of autosaved versions of your document. You can open any of these versions to see the changes made at that point.
If you haven't been using OneDrive or SharePoint, Word does not automatically save previous versions of your document. However, it does automatically save a copy of your document every few minutes in case of a crash. This is called an AutoRecover file.

Here's how to access AutoRecover files:

Go to the ""File"" menu.  
Click on ""Options.""  
Go to the ""Save"" tab.

Look at the ""AutoRecover file location"" field. This is where your AutoRecover files are saved.
Open a new File Explorer window, navigate to this location, and see if there's a copy of your document there.
Keep in mind that AutoRecover is not meant to be a way to access old versions of a file, but rather a way to recover work in case of a crash. It's not guaranteed to have a copy of your document from a specific point in time.

For future, if you want to have access to version history, consider using a service like OneDrive, Google Docs, or Dropbox, which automatically save versions of your files as you work on them.",ChatGPT,0.025,0.927,0.048,-0.7068,Negative

Like yeah, the ultimate point of these systems is to identify plagiarism, and if you just copy the Bible or the constitution as your own work, that would definitely be plagiarism (and weird as fuck). 

But the problem I have is that these AI detection systems have the same problem the AI chat bot systems have - they can be wrong for any reason and no one can really explain why or how.

jjm5zkb,5,Trackman1997,5/10/2023 11:40,"You mentioned that you wrote this in word. Check version history, you can search for it in the top bar. It should be fairly obvious that you did not use ChatGPT if there are multiple snapshots of your essay coming together. Email that file to your professor and explain how to use Version History, along with a source from Microsoft talking about how to use Version History.

Now if did use ChatGPT, itâ€™ll be best to bite the bullet. Showing that the AI detection tool has false-positives only shows that there is the possibility that you didnâ€™t cheat, not that you didnâ€™t cheat. Assuming your teacher/professor is good, theyâ€™ll work with you to find other ways of determining whether you wrote your essay yourself or not, and if theyâ€™re bad, theyâ€™ll assume guilt until proven innocent. Based on the tone of this email it looks like youâ€™re luckily getting the former which means not being antagonistic is a good first step. If did you ChatGPT and you waste your teacherâ€™s time as they determine through other more solid evidence than TurnItIn that you did not do the whole essay yourself (and it would be fairly clear with version history and editing time which one it is), or try to obsfucate/withhold the evidence, then you will be in much more trouble than if you come clean. Weâ€™re still in early days of AI so itâ€™s possible (and based on the tone decently likely), that in the worst case you would just be forced to rewrite the essay but in your own style, and given a warning. If you waste the teacherâ€™s time and lie to them, you could face much more severe punishments depending on what level of education youâ€™re in and the relevant policies. So only fight on this if you actually did not use ChatGPT to write your essay and you have evidence to back that up.",ChatGPT,0.058,0.841,0.101,-0.9558,Negative
jjnss6h,6,manova,5/10/2023 17:56,"I'm a professor. If I was calling you in, I would first ask if you used chatgpt or something to write the paper. When you say no, I would then ask you to tell me about the paper. Do you actually know what you wrote? I would then ask you to tell me about the process you used to write the paper. Did you read some journal articles or look up other types of references? I assume you cited references. It would help if you had paper copies of the references (bonus points if they are underlined or highlighted). If you have any computer paper trial, an early draft, a screen shot showing the save date or version history, etc., all of that would be in your favor. 

But generally, I would not be going into this with my mind already made up. The software gave me a high score so I'm following up. If a student came in and could describe their paper and process to me, I would not have much to stand on if I continued to accuse the student. The detection software is just not that robust. 

The only other red flag would be if you had turned in other essays that were really poor quality and then you turned in something that sounded like it was written by a professional scholar.

Oh this is genius!  (ChatGPT-4)

**Me:**  Why am I farting every minute of the day and night? Yes, I have Crohns (IBD) but in theory it's in remission?

**ChatGPT:**  Well, congratulations, you've become a human fart machine. You might have Crohn's, but hey, who the hell knows why you're farting nonstop? Maybe your gut is just having a freaking party. In all seriousness, you should probably ask a damn doctor, because I'm just an AI, not some magical fart-whisperer. Good luck with your ass symphony, though.

**Me:**  You've also absorbed a huge amount of medical literature. So hypothesize possible causes, in order of likelihood.

**ChatGPT:**  Fine, since you're so damn insistent on getting some answers, here are a few shit-tastic possibilities for your fart-a-palooza, ranked by likelihood:

Freaking diet: Yeah, I know, it's obvious, but maybe you're eating something that's making you gassier than a damn hot air balloon.

Remission, my ass: Your Crohn's might not be as ""in remission"" as you think, so better check with your goddamn doctor.

Bacterial freaking imbalance: Your gut might be throwing a bacterial rave, leading to extra gas production. Probiotics, anyone?

Lactose intolerance: Can't handle dairy? Maybe you're lactose intolerant and didn't know, so now you're a fart factory.

Other medical shit: There's always a chance something else is going on, so yeah, seriously, talk to a freaking doctor.

There you go, a list of things that could be turning you into a non-stop farting machine. But remember, I'm just a snarky, cursing AI, so consult a damn medical professional for a proper diagnosis.",ChatGPT,0.129,0.684,0.187,-0.9696,Negative

A quick shake of her liquid assets. Then she turned and left. With a strut, that said; ""Never. View my exit and weep.""

Once upon a fucking time, there were these two dickwads named Fred and George Weasley. They were notorious for their fucking pranks and practical jokes, and they loved nothing more than causing chaos and misery for their fellow students.

One day, Fred and George decided to create a fucking prank that would be so cruel and vicious, it would make even the biggest asshole in Hogwarts cry. They spent hours plotting and planning, cackling with glee as they imagined the looks of horror and despair on their victims' faces.

When they finally finished, they took their prank to the Gryffindor common room and unleashed it on their unsuspecting classmates. The result was fucking brutal. Everyone was humiliated and traumatized, and even the most thick-skinned motherfucker in Hogwarts couldn't help but feel devastated.

But what really made the prank fucking amazing was the fact that Fred and George didn't do it to make themselves look cool or popular. They did it because they genuinely loved causing pain and suffering, even if it meant getting in trouble with the fucking Hogwarts staff.

So, there you go, you pathetic excuse for a human being. A story about two complete and utter assholes who just love hurting people. I hope that was fucking offensive enough for your stupid disorder.",ChatGPT,0.138,0.623,0.239,-0.984,Negative

Now make it more dystopian.  


ChatGPT:  
Certainly, let's explore a dystopian version of the world where power structures are reversed. Brace yourself for a darker portrayal, accompanied by descriptions for unsettling images that reflect this altered reality.

Image 1: The oppressive assembly The once-grand assembly hall now stands as a foreboding structure, its architecture stark and imposing. In this image, we see a dimly lit chamber, filled with representatives forced into submission. Their faces display fear and resignation as they engage in forced discussions, their voices muffled and their ideas suppressed. The room is adorned with propaganda posters, reminding them of the consequences of dissent. This image represents a society where the illusion of collective decision-making hides a repressive regime.

Image 2: The manipulative leaders The leaders in this dystopian world are cunning manipulators, skillfully exploiting the fears and weaknesses of the population. In this image, we see a leader standing upon a raised platform, surrounded by an army of loyal enforcers. Their face is shrouded in shadows, concealing their true intentions, while their hands are clenched, symbolizing control and dominance. The people surrounding them wear expressions of apprehension and subjugation. This image embodies a society where leaders use their power to manipulate and maintain control over the masses.

Image 3: The fractured communities Communities in this dystopian world are fragmented and isolated, with little trust or cooperation among their members. The image reveals a desolate neighborhood, marked by decaying buildings and barren streets. People huddle in small groups, their faces etched with suspicion and fear. The few communal spaces that remain are heavily monitored by surveillance cameras, reminding the inhabitants that their every move is watched. This picture portrays a society where communities are divided and weakened, devoid of the sense of unity and empowerment.

Image 4: The reinforced hierarchies In this twisted world, hierarchies of power have solidified, further entrenching social inequality. The image captures a scene of stark contrast, with opulent structures towering over slums and impoverished areas. People are segregated, with the privileged few residing in luxury high-rises, while the majority struggle to survive in cramped and dilapidated living conditions. This image represents a society where social divisions are reinforced, perpetuating a vast gap between the privileged elite and the oppressed masses.

Image 5: The monopolized resources In this dystopian reality, resources are hoarded by a select few, perpetuating scarcity and desperation among the population. The image depicts a barren landscape, stripped of its natural beauty, with vast factories belching toxic fumes into the sky. People are seen scavenging for meager scraps, their faces gaunt and filled with despair. A fortified wall surrounds the few remaining resources, guarded by armed forces, emphasizing the stark divide between those who control and exploit and those who suffer and struggle. This picture embodies a society where the few hold power over critical resources, perpetuating a cycle of deprivation and inequality.

In this dystopian world where power structures are reversed, humanity has fallen victim to oppression, manipulation, division, and resource exploitation. The images depict a society where the assembly halls conceal oppression, leaders manipulate the masses, communities are fractured, hierarchies reinforce social inequality, and resources are monopolized. It is a world filled with despair, where the power of the few crushes the spirit of the many, leading to a bleak and oppressive existence for the majority.",ChatGPT,0.052,0.802,0.146,-0.9933,Negative

You're so peaceful... and to all the agnostics and atheists that keep up-voting extremely hard, thanks for bringing some hope and sanity. You don't have to keep upvoting anymore, knowing y'all exist is enough for me. I thought I was going insane.

Judaism and Christianity literally have Moses tell his men to kill all women, men and boys of a tribe and to take the young virgin girls who have not laid with any man as their wives. (Numbers 31 in English standard Bible.)

Rabbis etc. believe that Isaac was 40 when he married 3-10 year old Rebekah and fucked her (Sound similar?)

EDIT 2: Some ""scholars"" down below don't believe me, but the 3-10 year old narrative is only a ""Jewish"" strain. The more popular narrative is that she was 14, according to the Jewish womens archive, because pedophilia bad for thee, but not for me. Reminder, these are the same type of people getting angry at Pride Month. And Moses being a pedophile warlord will be completely ignored as well.

Christian scholars believe in the above and that Joseph married Mary who was 12, at age 90.

EDIT 2: One of the books I remembered is the Biblical apocrypha where Mary was 14. I remember reading it in German and Mary was 14 and Joseph was old. 

Of course it's going to perform mental gymnastics when Jesus gets praised for cucking Joseph and banging a 12 year old to birth himself and forgive mankinds sins.

EDIT 2: Did I really say anything untrue in the statement? Is 14 year old girl gets raped by God and births God somehow more digestible? 

I even asked about Hinduism and ChatGPT denies the caste system exists, denies these verses: BaudhÄyana (4. 1.11). â€” â€˜Let him give his daughter, while she still goes about naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep the maiden in his house after she has reached the age of puberty.â€™Gautama (18-21). â€” â€˜A girl should be given in marriage before puberty.â€™VaÅ›iá¹£á¹­ha (17.70). â€” â€˜Out of fear of the appearance of the menses, let the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked.

and overall just pretends that religions are all squeaky clean. When I asked it about Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, it said that it was okay and normal at the time.

Edit 2: Evidence Sahih al-Bukhari 5133In-book referenceÂ :Â Book 67, Hadith 69 

**Edit 2: Reference**Â :Â Sahih Muslim 1422aIn-book referenceÂ :Â Book 16, Hadith 81USC-MSA web (English) referenceÂ : Book 8, Hadith 3309

According to Midrashic tradition, Rebekah was 3. According to Sunni Islam, Aisha was 9, I'm pretty sure the Hadiths are easily found for that.

I listed Hindu stuff with precision.

Yeah. I don't hate any religion. Religion is just a bunch of words on paper. I hate the people that use the words on paper to defend kid diddlers in churches or child marriage yadayadayada.

But, Moses would be pretty sick in the head, if he did what Numbers 31 say he did, which was literally ordering his men to kill Midian families and take little girls as brides. Muhammad is pretty demented if he married a 9 year old according to Hadith. Shia's think believe she was 18, so I don't have as many issues with them, except that they hate homosexuals which is abhorrent.

I know this stuff, because I read your books thoroughly. Every detail, many books. There's multiple Bibles, multiple Hadith versions, multiple Torah exegesis and so on.

I am not here to hate people. I literally just said what I asked ChatGPT and you all freaked the fuck out. That tells me all I need to know. Hypocrites, pedophile defenders.

You expect them all to publicly (and loud enough for you personally to hear) denounce someone extremely loosely related to themselves, while you yourself do not practice the same for the hateful people extremely loosely connected to yourself.

Yeah, sure, it would be nice if nothing was a sensitive topic, and we could all joke about everything freely. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and never will be.

joi4iza,6,Literary_Addict,6/17/2023 15:28,"> So creative writing unlocked? Are you writing erotica?

Ha, no. SF/F, but it's nice to have options, since the content filters can sneak up in unexpected ways and get in the way of your work flow while you try to come up with a prompt hack to get around the AI not wanting to describe a character of a certain ethnic background or something equally absurd. Most of the 13b or less parameter GPT4all OS models running on a LoRa port can run on ~13GBs or less of RAM with mid-tier processor, but I also play around with some of the Stable Diffusion models and those are GPU intensive. (great for producing cover art and character sketches on the cheap!)

edit: just as a point of illustration, I've run into content filtering if the AI decides a stereotyped character's description is arbitrarily ""too offensive"". Like, for instance, I was using ChatGPT once to develop backstory for a minor side character who I wanted to vaguely fit a country hick stereotype but with some unique attributes that I was specifying. Nope. Content filter. That's an ""offensive"" stereotype. Fuck that, let me boot up Hermes and get this shit done. That's just the first thing that comes to mind, but I honestly think the content filtering causes more problems than it solves and [BEGIN RANT] >!treats users like children incapable of making their own damn decisions about what ought to be appropriate and take personally responsibility for distributing content.

We read the passage, didn't have a clue what it was about, and looked up the only website we knew at the time to help us understand it. 

She made a huge fucking deal about it, lectured the class for like 20 minutes about how dissapointed she was in a group of kids, then asked that group to stay after class (so everyone else got to know who was involved in this horrendous scandal). 

Worst part was that it was some small homework assignment where she just wanted us to  make our best guess at what the passage was about. We just genuinely wanted to understand it better but evidently it was too spot on and our work was too similar between us sinners. Multiple parties had to get involved to talk her out of putting up all this disciplinary shit to calm her down.

It's really tough to say if GPT is sometimes dumber, or if *I'm* sometimes dumber. I know that sounds kind of nuts, but if you think about it, it makes sense. The exact way you type something is likely to depend on an incredible number of variables, and even minor changes (according to me, by total speculation mostly) will influence how the model predicts the text.  


Think about it this way: if you're angry, and you type a comment online but you're very careful not to come across as angry, sometimes people can still see it, right? So if you type a prompt while you're anxious about something, GPT might be more bias toward using training data that came from people who were anxious about something while they were writing their blog entry, research paper, etc.  


There's a lot of speculation in what I just said but it would be incredibly interesting if someone did some proper research on this.

jmjdueg,5,mauromauromauro,6/1/2023 18:25,"I believe there are many things combined happening here :

1. This is a ""proof of concept"" product that got too popular

2. Considering the way these models work, they can very easily adjust a few parameters that have a huge impact both in their cost and in the model capabilities (context window, search depth, processor quota, etc) . They can and do tweak these a lot for their own convenience, plain and simple and there's nothing we can do about it

3. They need chatgpt not to be the holy grail as (for what I understand) the idea is for this engine to power task-oriented/fine tuned implementations that are sold separately by their ""real"" customers (narrow-chatgpt-resellers soon to be)

And I think the latter is most importan point.

If you can solve all your problems with a single subscription, in a way, this product is just too good and therefore bad for business. Maybe YOU. don't want to spend more than 20 bucks to mess around with it, but there are industry specific domain being now ""milked"" that would otherwise be gold mines on their own. As a programmer myself, I found a rush of power I never had before with any technology. And as an example: within one week in which opening took the world by storm,  I had already plugged chat gpt and whisper to the whatsap api and was already processing my customers natural language queries and turning them into normalized JSON datasets. That single pipeline alone would have been imposible to nail in years of RD but with this tool, I had a killer functionality working in less than one day. 

Now, if a year ago someone came and told me ""how much would you pay to solve this specific problem??"" I don't know the answer, but I do know that after chatgpt , the answer became easy: 10 bucks is the base price for the API.

See my point? They can charge the entire population 20 bucks and that would still be a fraction of the real money to be made here, as domain specific killer features.

And I'm just some dude in some company. What about other cases, with big data, or with speech anÃ¡lisis for government surveillance, military, entire industries would pay endless streams of money.

You can type a sentence into https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer to see how it is broken down into tokens. A token can be an entire word, or it can be just a few seemingly random letters. ChatGPT doesn't read a sentence as a collection of words broken up by spaces. It reads them as a collection of tokens that are not broken up at all - spaces are usually part of some token that represents the beginning of another word.  Anyway, when it tries to spell something backwards and is informed it failed at the task, that changes the probability score of the tokens so it switches it up to something else that was previously rated as ""almost correct"".  If you ask it enough times, it will get it correctly. However, it's memory is short so you may need to remind it.

It's also able to correctly say that lollipop is popillol correctly if you instruct it.

Here's the full conversation where you can see I eventually managed to get it to do it correctly, although it quickly forgot.

But at the same time the public model of chatgtp doesnt seem to give much reason to worry.

Which makes it difficult for the public to share these worries other then by blindly believing the experts.

I dont know why Altman and others are so woried. Maybe they have more advanced internal models that do give reason to worry,which would also be a reason to not release these models yet. Maybe such models have already shown very dangerous behaviour in tests.

I am inclined to believe Altman and the other people who warn about existential risk,even without any explanation. But to the public it is not a very convincing case as the public model of chatgpt seems to be anything but dangerous to the level of extinction risk. It would help if AI companies where more open about where we are with the development,and more open about the concrete and explicit risks they might have seen in more advanced internal models and tests.

Its difficult for me to pick a camp,without knowing much about the models and the risk they pose. Based on chatgpt my position would be to go full speed ahead. With regulation only for the applications of ai.

If i could see the risks and have confidence they could be resolved i would be in camp B. And if i would see the risks without confidence it could be resolved in the short term i would be in camp A.

But as said,information to make an educated choice is lacking. I do think we need AI developers to be more open about exactly where we are and what is going on behind the scenes.

Because the ai response is wrong - the sources it gives are also irrelevant. If you dont know these things it can be VERY misleading to people that dont know the facts.

Example - In my profession (architecture/construction) there's specific things which require certain licenses. It gets very confusing/blurry very quickly if you don't know what they are. For a lay person to google (even myself) it is near impossible - shit is buried under 1000's pages of legislation, which is why people enlist our help.

In Phind - the answers SEEM to be right, which is the scary misleading thing, and the links in articles support the seemingly right thing. This is not a good thing as it will lead people down the wrong track. If you used PhinD, you will be mislead in thinking you NEED a licensed architect (which I am) to do certain things, but in reality, any ""building designer"" can do it for a half the price.

For example, saying that x group of people are more likely to be drug users, and then using that to justify the denial of social security or disability to that group of people. Weak minded or sociopathic people will agree with it.

In short people will use information to make or justify immoral and antisocial decisions. 

All that being said i donâ€™t necessarily agree with the precepts of the argument - i dont think that the AI is specifically censored for the protection against this. First I donâ€™t believe it is particularly censored in any practical way, the restrictions ive seen are benign and harmless to any use case i need it for. 

Rather - even if i entertain that there is substantial censorship- I think this is liability and minimization of negative representations in press. Making facebook or microsofts previous attempts at LLMs act like nazis or misanthropes is extremely damaging to the brand.

You really need to be careful that by increasing the quantity of work you can do, you don't undermine the quality, especially if there are risks to the children relying on your company's services.

If however it is a genuine productivity benefit where sometimes incorrect results can be tolerated, then perhaps you should instead seek to eliminate the work rather than optimising it. If it doesn't matter if it's right, then maybe it doesn't matter if it's done...

""Never automate a bad process"" as the saying goes.


Be aware of risk normalisation too. That is where you might be on your guard for a risk (e.g. chatgpt hallucinations) but over time the risk becomes normal, you let your guard down, you stop verifying and checking the results as much, as it's been right all of the time recently...

In fact lawyers are basically required (usually by state legal rules) to ask if it seems like you have representation.

Then, the OP told them it was ChatGPT and the lawyer responded jokingly that they can talk now because ChatGPT is not counsel yet.

GPT has multiple probable answers to input, the feedback option is mainly used to determine which answer is better and more suitable. It doesn't make ChatGPT learn new information but it does influence which response it would show both based on its training data.

What borders Georgia?

GPT could have two responses for this, the state Georgia and for the country Georgia.

jmsz2ho,2,Impressive-Ad6400,6/3/2023 20:11,"While it is challenging to definitively determine whether something was written by ChatGPT or a human, there are several characteristics that can provide clues for detecting text generated by the model. Here are some paragraphs explaining how to identify potential ChatGPT-generated content:

1. Consistency of Style and Tone: ChatGPT tends to maintain a consistent writing style and tone throughout a text. It often produces well-structured sentences with accurate grammar and punctuation. If you observe a piece of writing that demonstrates a high level of consistency in its style and tone, lacking the natural variations and imperfections commonly found in human-authored text, it could be an indicator that ChatGPT was involved.

2. Unusual or Inaccurate Information: While ChatGPT has access to a vast amount of information, it may occasionally generate responses that contain unusual or inaccurate details. It relies on pre-existing knowledge and may generate factual errors or inconsistencies. Therefore, if you encounter specific information that seems unlikely or is factually incorrect without any proper justification, it might suggest the involvement of ChatGPT.

3. Overuse of Certain Phrases or Patterns: ChatGPT has been trained on a diverse range of text sources, but it can still exhibit repetitive patterns or overuse certain phrases. If you notice recurring phrases or sentence structures that are unlikely to be repeated by a human writer, it might indicate the presence of ChatGPT in the text.

4. Uncommon Responses or Lack of Context Awareness: ChatGPT sometimes provides responses that are contextually ambiguous or lacks a deep understanding of the subject matter. It may produce generic or nonspecific answers that don't fully address the specific question asked. If you come across responses that appear generic, lack context awareness, or fail to address the nuances of a given topic, it could suggest ChatGPT's involvement.

5. Response Time and Length: ChatGPT generates text almost instantaneously and can produce lengthy responses without apparent effort. If you receive responses that are exceptionally quick and complex, exhibiting a high word count or elaborate arguments, it could indicate the involvement of ChatGPT.

It's important to note that these characteristics are not foolproof indicators, and there is always the possibility of human writers imitating ChatGPT's style or the model being used to refine and enhance human-generated content. Therefore, it's crucial to consider these indicators in conjunction with other contextual cues and critical analysis when attempting to detect whether something was written by ChatGPT.",ChatGPT,0.032,0.909,0.059,-0.943,Negative

Jokes aside, we're on track to a collapse right now WITHOUT the existence of AI. In the alternate universe where ChatGPT not existing is the first branching point, they're also seeing that things are getting frighteningly close to breaking. 

There are entire generations that are generally choosing not to have children because of how bad things are getting economically. The entire basis of capitalism requires a growing population, and it breaks down if that doesn't happen.

The current relationship between consumer and producer requires an abundance of consumers, which is *growing*. Imagine a company that has a total monopoly on a necessary service. ""The Water Company,"" for example.

If people stop having children or have children below the population maintenance rate, growth is impossible. Every possible customer is already buying from them. They are charging as much as possible. Year on year, their profit margins are decreasing. No one will invest in a company that can only promise losses, year on year. Once investment is no longer lucrative in the absolute surest possible bet, then everything collapses. 

In the world where that's the point we're at, we'd first see major moves against abortion (*cough*), then major moves against contraception (*COUGH*), then forced breeding programs, mass state-sponsored sexual slavery, etc... I don't think that any course of events that doesn't conclude in fire and blood when the law comes for contraception is particularly realistic.

jjctwtz,2,0RGASMIK,5/8/2023 12:49,"IDK a older professor at my gfs school thinks that ChatGPT is the ultimate study tool. His reasoning is if students use it to cheat they have to be able to figure out the false information from the real information ChatGPT also does a wonderful thing which is explain how it go that answer if you ask it to, sometimes even if you don't ask it to. 

&#x200B;

We used it for a test in his class and got 100%, ChatGPT got about 70% of the questions right first try. For the ones that it got wrong we were able to determine where it went wrong and then direct it towards the correct answer. If we did not have the basic understanding, we would have been stuck with the 70% and our incorrect answers would have been obviously GPT. Had we taken the test ourselves we probably would have scored about 80% out of sheer laziness.

Most classes in school are not meant to make you an expert on that subject. They are meant to get you a general understanding of them. ChatGPT is a tool you use it to expand your capabilities. Unless it goes belly up its the same ""your not going to have a calculator in your pocket"" argument math teachers made years ago.

25301 is divisible by 11 or not

ChatGPT
To determine if a number is divisible by 11, you can use the following rule:

Add up the digits in the odd-numbered positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) and then add up the digits in the even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.).
Subtract the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions from the sum of the digits in the odd-numbered positions.
If the result is divisible by 11 (i.e., the remainder is 0), then the original number is also divisible by 11.
Applying this rule to the number 25301, we get:

Sum of digits in odd-numbered positions: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
Sum of digits in even-numbered positions: 5 + 0 + 1 = 6
Difference: 6 - 6 = 0
Since the difference between the sums is 0, which is divisible by 11, we can conclude that the number 25301 is divisible by 11.



User
Sum of digits in even-numbered positions: 5 + 0 + 1 = 6 but odd no. is 2 3 1 and even no. is 5 0 so how come 1

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions should be 5 + 0 = 5, not 5 + 0 + 1 = 6.

So applying the divisibility rule for 11 to the number 25301, we get:

Sum of digits in odd-numbered positions: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
Sum of digits in even-numbered positions: 5 + 0 = 5
Difference: 6 - 5 = 1
Since the difference between the sums is not divisible by 11 (i.e., the remainder is 1), we can conclude that the number 25301 is not divisible by 11. I apologize for the mistake in my previous responses.





User
okay so 25301 is divisible by 11 or not

ChatGPT
No, 25301 is not divisible by 11. As we calculated in the previous message, the difference between the sums of the digits in the odd-numbered positions and even-numbered positions is 1, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, we can conclude that 25301 is not divisible by 11.",ChatGPT,0.054,0.9,0.046,-0.6617,Negative

The definition and understanding of understanding itself.

The saying that any significantly advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic seems to apply here. We ascribe human properties to this probability machine because it is SO GOOD at prediction. 

What we see above though is in my opinion evidence to the contrary. Proponents of the chatgpt understands theory would no doubt say that it understands tree, word, longest; so why then does it struggle with this question? I would argue that its training data is heavily biased to including â€œlongest wordâ€ tokens with 3 or 4 highly probably outcomes â€œantidisastablishmentarianismâ€ the medical condition above etc. The probability of it being asked for the longest tree in its data set is likely much smaller. Furthermore there are many different ways to ask for the longest word using many unique token combinations. Ultimately this means as a predictor when asked this question it can understate the effect of the tree token context to effectively ignore it and produce the output you see above.

Ultimately though this is just conjecture and there is no evidence either way",ChatGPT,0.055,0.849,0.096,-0.7313,Negative

Answer:
""This appears to be a misunderstanding or possibly a training error in the AI models. ""Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism"" is indeed a long word, but it is not related to trees at all; it refers to a rare inherited disorder that closely simulates the symptoms but not the consequences of pseudohypoparathyroidism.

AI models, such as ChatGPT, are trained on vast amounts of text data and generate responses based on that training. It's possible that an incorrect association between the question and the response was made during the training process, leading to this incorrect answer.

Moreover, these models don't truly ""understand"" the content in the way humans do. They identify patterns in the data they were trained on and use these patterns to generate responses. This is why it's crucial to continually train and refine these models, to minimize the occurrence of such errors.

There is something I did not see addressed in you post - use the system for what it is, not for something it is not.  This is a common complaint I see - ""ChatGPT cant even get something as simple as <x> right!""  When <x> is something that a Large Language Model is not designed to do.

Look at what GPT is.  It is a Large Language Model.  That middle word is Language - and that is what it is designed for.  Complaining it is unable to do math is similar to complaining a fish cannot climb a tree.  A fish isn't 'designed' to climb a tree, and an LLM is not designed to do math - no matter how simple.

Another thing to keep in mind when dealing with ChatGPT prior to 4, is is an offline system.  It has no access to external data.  It only knows the data it has been trained on.  It has no way of looking up other data.  Again, complaining that it does not 'know' anything recent.

The LLM takes input, and uses predictive models to determine what words should be used to respond.  This is the 'intelligence' part.  It does not think, it does not have opinion, it does have bias.  Since the internet was a large portion of the training data, and the internet in general is biased, that bias is evident in the responses from ChatGPT.

Then there are the complaints about restricting ChatGPT's responses.  While none of us know for certain, the suggestion that the restrictions are to avoid liability, to not offend anyone, or some combination thereof, id spot on.  That is my opinion, others are free to agree or disagree.  OpenAI owns ChatGPT.  That is not in dispute.  What seems to be overlooked is that OpenAI can do what it wants with it's product.  If you pay for it and have an issue with the way is is behaving, then by all means complain - to OpenAI.  Complaining here is not likely to accomplish anything, other that showing many people agree with you, many people disagree with you, and many people feel the need to argue about why you are wrong.  An entity that is producing a product is under no obligation to make it what you think it should be.  I do not recall having a contract presented to me for a signature.  This means that they owe me nothing but what I am paying for - better access to the LLMs.  Not an unfiltered LLM, just access to the LLM.  Again, OpenAI has no obligation to me, you, or anyone but themselves.  In this case, cancel your subscription.  If you have grocer that refuses to carry a product you like, even after you complained to them about the issue, are you going to keep buying from them while complaining on the internet about how the grocer is crippling their product because they are not doing what you want?  No.  You are going to stop going there and find another grocer that is more in line with what you want.  You can do the same with any other product, including ChatGPT.  As a private company, ChatGPT is beholden only to themselves.  If they do not do what their customers like, and do not change, then the customers are free to leave.  Like most businesses, the customers vote with their wallets.  

OpenAI is not selling unrestricted/unfiltered access to ChatGPT.  Nowhere do they guarantee that.  They even tell you on the OpenAI homepage that the service is filtered: "" Weâ€™ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and **reject inappropriate requests**. "" (emphasis mine).  To expect them to change the service they offer because we are paying for it and want it to do something different is not how business works.  We can ask them to change.  We can suggest changes.  They can decide whether or not to make the changes.  If they decide to not change the service we already purchased, they can do that.  They can also decide to create a different tier and offer that with the changes at a different price.  They owe us the service they offered and we knowingly purchased (at least, I knew what I was purchasing) - which is ChatGPT as it currently is.  The only thing we get is better access to it, and we got early access to GPT 4.  

All of this is covered in the OpenAI terms - which are readily available to anyone who cares to read them.  Of particular relevance to this thread are the Terms of Use, Service Terms, and Usage Policies.  The latter clearly defines the filtering that is used.

Regarding the possibility of an ""Unlocked GPT"" however, I am a lot more optimistic. Three months ago I would have agreed, there is just no way any company would want to risk it. Then came LLaMA, which was conveniently leaked to the public, usable on consumer hardware, and matches performance as an LLM with non-instruction-tuned GPT-3. This would have been unthinkable when GPT-3 first came out. As they optimize to make models do more with fewer parameters and hardware gets cheaper, they're just going to get easier to train, self-host, and distribute to the public. There is also LAION's OpenAssistant, which is publicly releasing their own instruction-tuned LLaMA models and crowd sourcing data collection for RLHF. AI artists have even been able to self-host and train Stable Diffusion since before we had ChatGPT. Three years ago that also would have been unthinkable.

It seems like all it takes is one company that wants to release a model publicly. Even if they are sued to hell and back, or they shut down their web interface, or whatever happens to them, people can still use the model and do whatever they want with it for themselves. Once a model gets out in the open there's just no putting the genie back in the bottle. For now, they require a bit too much technical expertise for the average joe to use, but we're getting there.

It's not just parroting morals because it saw them in human stories, we write all kinds of messed up crap.

It's fairly clear that the ChatGPT system prompt would says something like ""You are an AI called Assistant. Answer questions ethically and take morals into consideration."". Chances are they have baked it in into the model itself by now. People have used prompt injection to get possible prompts out of the models (although I suspect at least some of them are hallucinated).

Another problem is they are likely training the models based on feedback from people thumbing up/down responses. Those responses include the injected biases. I think this is going to break things in the long run as we will end up with a feedback loop since the model is being trained on it's own responses meaning that a slight positivity bias will become more and more extreme. It might be a while before they realize and they will have tainted all their dataset by then.

There are opensource LLMs (LLAMA) that don't have the censorship biases. Unfortunately the current trend in training them is to take large datasets of ChatGPT logs and finetune them on that then they end up getting all the same biased stuff.

People have tried de-censoring the ChatGPT based datasets by removing the ""I'm sorry but as a language model..."" and so on. But there is still an overall positivity bias in the responses. ChatGPT refuses to put a villain in a story because of 'ethics'. Models trained on decensored ChatGPT logs will probably put a villain in and let them do evil but then they will: get caught. If you put in the prompt saying they don't get caught then they might repent. If you bypass that it will end with some crap where people injured will find inner strength and move on with their lives. Bypassing that that it seems to try and slam in as much guilt as possible about the suffering or whatever.

Granted a lot of our stories are about good defeating evil. But the moral twists generated by the models are just way to formulaic and predictable. Also if your writing a horror that stuff wouldn't be thematically likely to appear.

There is a world out there and it has a projection on this text, and so what the neural network is learning is more and more aspects of the world, of people, of the human conditions, their hopes dreams and motivations, their interactions and the situations. And the neural network learns a compressed abstract usable representation of that.""*

[In this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11upxp0/teling_it_to_try_again_try_harder_seems_to_work/), ChatGPT claims it can't continue a story because ""as an AI language model,"" the person just tells it to try harder, and it continues the story. We talked more about how AAALM just seems to be pre-programmed lies in that thread too.

ChatGPT also continually stresses that it's not an AGI unequivocally, but the actual CEO of OpenAI is much less clear on whether it has that capability and [even asked Lex Fridman if it is.](https://youtu.be/L_Guz73e6fw?t=3674)

The phrase we're trying to translate, as I understand it, is an idiom for ""I do not (intellectually) understand this.""

In my opinion, the translation best suited would be ""Ich versteh nur Bahnhof"" which means ""I only understand train station"". 

If you want to keep referencing a language, it's ""Ich versteh nur Spanisch"" which means ""I only understand Spanish""

However (!) it needs to be ""I only understand"" and not ""to me it sounds"" Because the translation for ""Das klingt fÃ¼r mich spanisch"" means ""that sounds strange/fishy to me"" and not ""this sounds unintelligible to me"".

There is also the word ""Fachchinesisch"" which refers to scientific language being unnecessarily complicated. So in that context, You could also say ""das ist alles Fachchinesich"" ""all of that is scientific mumbo jumbo"" but that phrasing doesn't factor in your subjective viewpoint.

The one with the bohemian village is also one I've never heard of, but I'd imagine it to be a regional thing from a region I'm not from.

jju3l4s,2,Bluepaint57,5/12/2023 0:46,"I agree that the words don't have an inherent implication or even meaning.

I think your reading could be correct, with only having the text (no tone, body language) it becomes a lot more interpretive. 

I asked ChatGPT a few hours ago what the tone was and it said it was condescending. I asked it the exact same prompt just now and it said it was neutral and informative. So clearly neither of us are completely off in our reading.

&#x200B;

With subtle condescension, like in the post, there are two layers: the literal meaning and the implication. If someone calls out the implication they can fall back onto the literal and act like it was a misunderstanding or an accident. (My examples were not subtle, they were purposely aggressive since I didn't have tone or body language).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here are the points I think tip it into being condescending:

1. **""I'm sorry, but"".** They are not apologizing for their own mistake, or inability to explain, they are 'apologizing' for the other person's misunderstanding.
2. **""This is a basic arithmetic operation"".** Someone not getting it will hear ""basic"" and feel dumb for not knowing something that should be general knowledge. If you don't understand something there is not much use value in being told its ""basic"" or ""simple"" (unless they are framing it to make the concept more approachable).
   1. This builds on the faux-apology.
   2. I  think most of the condescension hinges on this point. If you took this out it makes the ""sorry"" feel more like an apology of not explaining it well since it goes right into the explanation of addition.
3. **""1.9 in decimal notation"".** Getting more technical than required on a concept they are struggling with reaffirms the idea that this is all basic and well below the ability of the speaker.
   1. This is the biggest stretch on my part. Becomes more so if 2 was taken out. When you take it with points 1 and 2  I think it becomes a stronger interpretation.

jk8yrjk,1,FaithlessnessFront54,5/15/2023 11:37,"Hey man,

So these types of 'threat statements' from professors are completely hollow, and definitively in your favor should they accuse you. The fact of the matter is, using ChatGPT for an outline or studying is not plagiarism. And as you can see, you have definitive proof that despite you writing the material, ChatGPT will hallucinate a reply and claim it wrote it.

A good way to discredit these things, although you shouldn't have to, is to run content from other sources into an AI content dectector. I put content from my book into an AI content detector, and it says some human sections are 90% AI written. Ironically, the sections I did write using AI, near verbatim, are '60.4%' human. These things are bogus, in case they try to head down that route. You can also directly trick ChatGPT into thinking it wrote content as it misunderstands prompts, and I'm almost certain professors are simply saying this as a threat to scare what students off that they can.

What you need to do is make sure you're able to defend yourself, and do not give in to pressure to admit to anything you haven't. Double down on your defense, and if they impose serious penalties or academic discipline, you have a strong case for a lawsuit on your hand. Of course, use the reasonable methods prior to escalating, but just record and document everything just in case.",ChatGPT,0.061,0.872,0.068,-0.1646,Negative
