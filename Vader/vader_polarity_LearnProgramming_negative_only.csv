Someone who was new to Unity asked this question, and after I helped them troubleshoot it I thought it might be interesting to see if the bot could figure it out. 

The user had set up a simple looping 2D patrol for a character, running in update. If they used Vector2.lerp it stopped at the first patrol point, if it used vector3.lerp it disappeared from the camera during when approaching the second point but continued the loop. It was simple enough, Unity2d still has Z levels and a 3D environment, it just uses an orthographic camera and different collision logic to negate that (usually), the guy had put the 2nd patrol point at a z level behind the camera's clipping plane, so it disappeared when navigating the z level and when constrained to vector2 it was never able to match the position of the 2nd point. When I posed the question to ChatGPT, it simply assumed that since transform.position != patrolPoint[i].transform.position right now, it never moves to the next part of the patrol, as if it was a simple While loop, and ignored the fact that update is...updated.",learnprogramming,0.035,0.858,0.106,-0.944,Negative

iz3zbka,1,Kaining,12/6/2022 3:05,">  It's not solving a problem it is generating an output from internal rules to try to generate an answer that would be likely.

That's not that far off from what you do when you learn a skill. You start by reading about something, you ""think"" you understand the subject and you get confronted with practical exercice. To which you will get some wrong. 
Without a way to check your work, you won't learn, you'll just repeat mistakes and think you know your subject.

You need external input to validate your solution before being sure that what you did was actually solving a problem or not just be confidently wrong about something.

>  i donâ€™t think you should use it to learn python though, maybe use it as someone to bounce ideas off of.

That's exactly what i've been doing the last two night. And that's why i pretty much wrote a single line of code yesterday (by myself) and kept trying to see if there wasn't other possible solution i'm unaware off that would be more elegant by bombarding chatGPT with question.

ChatGpt will try stuff with modules, functions and methods i haven't yet encountered yet. It's not teaching per see, it's showing things that exist. Copy pasting will not teach you anything, messing with it and reading about what it shows you will.

It's more of an interactive search engine than teaching tool. What makes it a ""good"" tool in my book is that the proper documentation for python do exist and you can easily crosscheck it. Then, you can have it generate examples, lots of them and test them on your own to see how things work.

For example, it's the difference between a tutorial online about how to set up a local network, following it and having it either work or fail and bloody knowing about how local network do work and how to manipulate them. A google search will give you the former, messing",learnprogramming,0.066,0.86,0.073,-0.3436,Negative

Java has been around since the beginning of the 1990's. The basic concept of the language has in principal not changed. A program written in Java 1 can be run on a Java 19 runtime.

One teacher that didn't fit your particular needs, does not mean everyone is terrible. Also if you don't like his/her teaching style, then tbh you might need to put in additional work outside.  


Every teacher can impossibly fit each students needs, what you are asking for is an impossibility. I suggest you accept the fact that this particular teacher does not suit your teaching needs and you'll have to accept the fact that you need to compensate outside of class and put additional work in.

jdw7yro,-3,Outrageous_Neat_6232,3/27/2023 13:25,"I don't see how ChatGPT is lazy when I quoted the type of question I request from it. I'm aware it isn't 100% accurate, however I use it to explain a concept in the bigger picture with real world examples that i'm experienced in (food for example). Here's an example of what it gave me for loops (which we covered one example problem in class and moved on)

""Loops and do-while loops serve similar purposes, but they have different structures and execution flows. Let's illustrate the difference between a loop (using a for loop as an example) and a do-while loop in the context of food:  
Imagine you have a bowl of fruits, and you want to eat one fruit at a time until there are no fruits left in the bowl. Here's how you could represent this using a for loop and a do-while loop in pseudocode:  
For loop:  
bowl\_of\_fruits = 5  
for (count = 1; count <= bowl\_of\_fruits; count++) {  
eat\_fruit()  
}

  
Do-while loop:  
bowl\_of\_fruits = 5  
do {  
eat\_fruit()  
bowl\_of\_fruits = bowl\_of\_fruits - 1  
} while (bowl\_of\_fruits > 0)

  
In both cases, you're eating one fruit at a time until there are no fruits left in the bowl. However, the for loop uses a loop control variable (in this case, count) to iterate through the loop a specific number of times (equal to the number of fruits in the bowl). The loop condition is checked at the beginning, and if it's false, the loop won't execute even once.  
In contrast, the do-while loop executes the loop body at least once, regardless of the loop condition, because the condition is checked after the loop body has been executed. In this example, you'll eat a fruit first and then check if there are any fruits left in the bowl. If there are, you'll continue eating fruits until the bowl is empty.""

If you are worried about the dangers of the Internet then just read and learn about cyber security and web application security (OWASP). Like that you will know what actually is possible and what is just a paranoia. If you are worried about getting hacked then read/learn about cyber hygiene and also about OSINT (use OSINT on yourself). Because if you are not aware of what is possible and what is not then you can imagine all kind of weirdness. That I will hack you over your Reddit comment and what not.

Drive-by downloads in general do nothing. They do not get executed by themself. Either you have to click on them physically or your browser has to execute them by itself (which it does not do, except with cookies and cookies will not have such negative impact on your system).

Like really, don't overthink but just educate yourself on stuff. Fear caused by ignorance can just make things worse. But when you are aware of how stuff works then there will be less ignorance and also less fear.

Forget hacking servers. Unless you want problems with police and such. If anything then ONLY try stuff with your own things: your own router, your own web application you host from your own PC/laptop, your own web server running inside your own PC/laptop.

Most likely you are still in a high school. Better concentrate on finishing that. No point to push yourself and burn out and then fail both your high school and probably will not be accepted to a programming related job either.

Why are you opposing a college? Because of the fees/loans? There exist student loans. You'll pay it back in some years when you get hired as a Junior developer. I mean, if you can then definitely go for a college degree. Many times better than learning on your own, aimlessly. Right now quite a different things that you are having problems with, it would be solved by college courses. They teach programming, cyber security, AI, cryptography (more like during Master studies, though), Linux administration and many other things.

Take your time off and rest. Where are you rushing to? I started my college studies when I was 28. Sure, I could start earlier but because of BURNOUT I decided to postpone my college studies and do all the other stuff during these years. Kind of a wasted time, a bit. These years between finishing my high school studies and between starting my college studies. But all because of a BURNOUT.
