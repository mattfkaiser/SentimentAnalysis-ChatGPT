Further reading, again via ChatGPT:

\- Friedrich Akimoto recommends ""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies"" by Nick Bostrom. He believes this book provides an essential foundation to the discourse on artificial superintelligence.

\- Priscilla Montague recommends ""Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"" by Max Tegmark. She finds it resonates with her belief in the evolutionary potential of superintelligence.

\- Juan Felipe Garcia recommends ""Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era"" by James Barrat. Garcia believes this book deeply explores the existential implications of superintelligence.

\- Oksana Vasilievna recommends ""Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy"" by Cathy O'Neil. This book mirrors her practical perspective on how AI tools can have ethical implications.

\- Sami al-Masri recommends ""The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World"" by Pedro Domingos. He believes the book provides insightful cautionary tales on the pursuit of AI.

\- Anaya Joshi recommends ""The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism"" by Fritjof Capra. She believes it hints at a harmonious unification of spirituality and science.

\- Dr. Samuel Okafor recommends ""The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology"" by Ray Kurzweil. He finds it provides an intriguing exploration of human ambition and its potential limitations.

\- Min-jun Park recommends ""The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene. He finds the book's exploration of unknown realms parallels our approach to superintelligence.

\- Emilia Bianchi recommends ""The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind"" by Marvin Minsky. Bianchi believes it sets a groundwork for understanding the complexities of artificial minds.

\- Jasper Van der Merwe recommends ""The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail"" by Clayton M. Christensen. He finds it compelling in its exploration of adaptation and the resistance to change.

Hope this experiment was of interest!",artificial

But how do you know that they all don't start with ""O"", but just in a way that our puny brains can't grasp?   Perhaps ChatGPT is vastly more intelligent than we are and it understands that they all start with ""O"" but in some way that defies what seems like ""common sense"" to us.

For example the Schrödinger equation predicts that a photon can be in two places at once and interfere with itself (also that a cat be be both alive and dead at the same time).   This all defies common sense to simple, primitive people, but highly intelligent, advanced people understand it.   Likewise, simple primitive people can't detect the ""O"" that ""Peru"" starts with, but  highly intelligent advanced AI's can grasp it easily.

jn1ai0r,1,the_anonymizer,2023-06-05 16:50:01,"I know what I'm talking about. The input is not encrypted because it is an AI model taking tokens in input (non encrypted). So your security, about your personal data, is relying on Open AI politics. And already many young people and even adults are talking to chatGPT about their personal life. There is no end to end encryption of conversations. So you are not the only one to have the keys to encrypt/decrypt your conversation with ChatGPT and all researchers have access to users conversations and people are talking about their whole life and personal problems to chat GPT, associated with a tel number and email address etc, which can lead to very important data leaks for your personal life.",artificial
jn4as92,1,the_anonymizer,2023-06-06 09:47:01,"There is a difference between 100% private (no entity other than chatGPT system accessing encryption keys), 99% private (admins having access to encryption keys), and 0% private (no encryption keys for inputs and no encryption for the database => all devs reading conversations without needing any special rights for accessing encryption keys). I even read the conversations titles of a guy wanting to buy insurance agencies one day. => i do not trust their security policy at all.

Encryption ensures a certain degree of privacy, but i never said the word privacy in my post, nor that 100% privacy is possible.

Original (incorrect) comment here

If your chatGPT conversations are not being encrypted. If the database ever leaked (which is has already once before) then any personal information you put in there could be used against you. Developers are feeding it API keys (which could rack up $20k in AWS charges overnight, if in malicious hands). Others are putting their companies proprietary code and design secrets in it, which could lead to huge lawsuits. Others are disclosing their finances and asking for tax advice, etc. All this is being stored in plain text, any employee with proper access could look for any one persons data and abuse it, blackmail you, etc and hackers could do the same at a massive scale",artificial
jmpmr6i,8,dronegoblin,2023-06-03 02:09:12,"You are correct.

I’ll be honest, I was going off the title and a quick skim of the article, which seemed to line up, but you are right, the caption of the article is totally wrong. 

ChatGPT responses are encrypted, although yes there have been numerous times when entire conversation histories have been swapped for userbase as a whole, and openAI retains full viewing and training access to your data. That and considering prior versions of GPT even would spit out peoples phone numbers, email addresses, etc, so openAI still has a bad rep for privacy. Not to mention, openAIs chief technology officer was hacked on Twitter just yesterday and used as a crypto scam, which further drives home why I wasn’t even surprised at the claim.",artificial
jmqpjx9,2,TripUnlikely1615,2023-06-03 09:56:51,"Can’t agree with you here. As described, this really isn’t an encryption issue. If an article exists that dissects the system architecture of ChatGPT in more detail with specific criticism on their encryption strategy, I’d be happy to discuss it.   
  
It’s a combination of an access control problem, data privacy and the ethics behind reselling user data (which is legal under specific circumstances). An access control problem is addressed by securing the authorization scopes of an application, which has nothing to do with encryption. There’s absolutely nothing in this article that describes a scenario in which user data is being stored in plain text.   
  
I’m not saying ChatGPT/OpenAI is an angel, I think any business that collects and sells user data is absolute scum. I just don’t like that the headline of this post claims that they are storing data unencrypted, while the article mentions nothing of the sort. It’s an alarmist take and it’s misinformation.",artificial
jmqle9g,2,thisguywonders,2023-06-03 09:21:11,"> ChatGPT prompts are encrypted 

What do you mean by that? There is no way the model itself works on encrypted data. That would mean encryption is entirely useless as AI is able to understand the contents of encrypted data.

Yes the data may be encrypted while sending it from your browser to their server (it's called HTTPS and almost every website uses it), but that doesn't mean it's encrypted in their databases etc. And even if it is encrypted in their databases, they must have a way to decrypt it, otherwise they could not feed it into the AI for processing.",artificial

Now the problem is what is their encryption politics in their databases etc. And who exactly is allowed to review conversations, how many people,  are they selling infos, datas, etc.. (cf. article). Yet people continue using Chat GPT as if it was a private communications tool, not even knowing what is the level of security of their datas inside Open AI systems.
