Yes, we can detect it based on sentence structure. AI has a distinct method of writing that stands out from usual student writing. Also, AI-generated text programs cannot provide references if your assignment calls for them. Since your professor explicitly wrote this in your syllabus, maybe you should not even be asking this question? It's plagiarism unless you are going to cite ChatGPT as a source. Also, if the professor suspects you cheated with ChatGPT and the assignment didn't call for references, they will ask you to specifically show them what sources you used. 

I have had students cheat like this before and this was the tell tale sign they had cheated. There are other methods of which I won't be stating here because I'm tired of people (especially some of you on this thread) who are actively helping a student cheat. 

Don't do it.
