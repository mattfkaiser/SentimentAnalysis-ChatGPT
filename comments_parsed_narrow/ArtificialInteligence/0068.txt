AI will eliminate stock traders just as easily as it's starting to eliminate artists, screenwriters, programmers, novelists, researchers, etc. Pretty soon it will replace CEOs and boards of directors, too. My nephew spent years working on his PHD but ChatGPT could write the whole thing in seconds with the right prompts and a bit of editing (and eventually AI will do that part too).  It's definitely going to replace exactly the thing you just spent all your time writing. You might be an AI bot for all we know. I might be as well. We could all be bots on this site having our back and forths. How would anyone know the difference?

I'd say the trend we are seeing here is the end of the economic system.
