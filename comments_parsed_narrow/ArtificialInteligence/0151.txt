I've been using ChatGPT and Bard to create stuff in Roblox, it's pretty impressive the shit you can accomplish with zero scripting experience. Also I built a website for my wife, I have to say it's pretty impressive. Prior to ChatGPT, I had no idea about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, now I'm building websites..

It's a crazy time to be alive.
