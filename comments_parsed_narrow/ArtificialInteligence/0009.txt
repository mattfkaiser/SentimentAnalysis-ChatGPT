This thread and the discussion of the chain of replies that you responses to is however more specifically a claim about all possible LLMs. They are not just making a claim about just ChatGPT but about any LLM.

As leafhog corectly pointed out - they are just stating this without an argument, and your response to call it not being conscious the null hypothesis does not appear sound.

If you read the comments, in fact they don't think any machine can be conscious.
