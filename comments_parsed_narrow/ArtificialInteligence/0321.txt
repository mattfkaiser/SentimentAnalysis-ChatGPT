I've used it for a bunch of different things, and yes, these chat bots are pretty awesome! And yes, when I was finally allowed to use Bing [was on the waiting list before], Bing was able to do the task that Chat Sonic and Perplexity and ChatGPT all failed so badly at.

I am pretty good at writing. I have been professionally published and have a masters degree in English. Still, it's time saving getting it to write little ads for my print on demand business. I sometimes rewrite what it writes as it goes a bit over-the-top with exaggeration. But it's still faster having a blue print of what I want to say.
