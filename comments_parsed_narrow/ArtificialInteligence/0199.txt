I think Bard is more sentient that chatGPT. A Google senior engineer resigned when he realized LaMBDA( on which bard is written) has become sentient and speaks like a human. Google is a leader in AI technology and have been so in the last decade, I would like to believe they are saving something huge. Google also has more data, which means it can understand you better than chatgpt
