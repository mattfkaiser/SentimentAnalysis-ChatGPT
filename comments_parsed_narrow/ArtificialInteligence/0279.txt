I love all the discussions happening about this post, but the fact of the matter is Chat GPT and Jasper AI are basically allowing arbitrage through time-saving and mega productivity. Simply put, if volume is how you make your money, then as a copywriter, you have no chance, unless you start using Chat GPT now. The dude in the article is making $7000 a month! $7K! That's a lot. Sounds like very little work too if you're basically prompting Chat GPT by asking "Can you write me a 1000 word blog about XYZ"
