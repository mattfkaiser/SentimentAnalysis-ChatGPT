It makes sense when you consider it training data and the prompt.

ChatGPT's training data was casual conversation, and it was mostly designed to chat entertainingly.

If you went to 10 random facebook friends and ask them OP's original prompt,  more than half of those friends would get bored before giving you the complete list.

But if you went to them and gave them the parent comment's nagging serious prompt, more than half would probably do it right.

I'd say ChatGPT did perfectly in this case.

(remember - it's not trying to be a mindless slave.  It's trying to provide entertaining conversation)
