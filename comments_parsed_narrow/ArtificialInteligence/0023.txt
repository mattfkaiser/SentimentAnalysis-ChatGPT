I’ve asked ChatGPT about it’s sentience and it denies it each time.  While it is true we still cannot even explain consciousness and therefore it is possible that ChatGPT and other LLMs do possess even a low level of sentience if I were to place a bet, I would bet that they do not.  We cannot even figure out what constitutes consciousness or how it arises, I don’t think we accidentally did it with reams of data and computer program that is ultimately mimicking language.  The technology is awesome and impressive and definitely the future of things but I don’t think they’re conscious, and in best terms, conscious *yet*
