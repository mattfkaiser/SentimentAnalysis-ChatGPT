> But, don't you think that AI will be better as AI therapist?

I'm speculating that other AI's interests are less likely to be aligned with your average human therapist's. 

Further exaggerating the anti-lock-brake troll comment, I could easily imagine another AI therapist effectively communicating *"you really shouldn't kill yourself -- things'll get better over time -- if you're feeling too frustrated, just [decelerate at about 11 G's](https://www.google.com/search?q=max+g+force+of+a+human) to vent some frustration"*.
