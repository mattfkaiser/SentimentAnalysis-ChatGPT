They might be able to, but you could always use a tool like JasperAI to reword for you. Then, run it through a free AI detector to make sure it passes as mostly human content. I don’t condone cheating, but if you’re going to do it, at least make sure it doesn’t sound like it’s written by a machine when read by your professor. 

If you do take this approach, take your time to ask ChatGPT to summarise your essay and also to provide further explanation & reasoning on each section so that you can respond to ad-hoc questioning by your professor if it’s too good/suspicious.
