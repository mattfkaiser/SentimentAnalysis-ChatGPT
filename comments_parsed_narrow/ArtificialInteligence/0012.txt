The last questions is dumb. Today we can only infer sentience through the observation of complex behavior. There is nothing about fortune cookie behavior to suggest sentience.

As for sleeping people: it kind of depends on how we choose to define sentience. Sleeping people aren’t conscious. Are they self aware? What if they are under anesthesia? I think we say that a sentient being is still sentient even if there is a short interruption to their cognitive processes.

I don’t think sentience is an all-or-nothing switch either. There is a gradient. I think humans are probably more sentient than dogs. Dogs are more sentient than alligators. Alligators are more sentient than ants. 

How sentient is a slime mold or a bacteria? Pretty close to zero, but we can still observe “intelligent” behavior in them. They at least respond to stimulus.

So where would ChatGPT fall on that spectrum? I argue it’s higher than a bacteria — at least through behavioral observation.
