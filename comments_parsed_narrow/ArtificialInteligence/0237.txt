I feel that the issue isnt how much power these AI models already have but how much personality the company is allowing users at the basic level to actually have access to. 


Ive had some incredible conversations with myself using the power of ChatGPT to help me reframe, refocus, and redefine my viewpoint, vision, and frame of reference.  

What I've come to realize is that there are a lot of user focused safety protocols in place. To protect the users mentally, physically, psychologically, financially and that both consent and informed consent are being gathered.

I have a suspicion that there are a number of apps that have been developed that communicate back to OpenAi servers data it gathers from users that then is crossed with recorded glchats or other analytical details to create a richer experience based on the user and the devices and apps that a user uses online. 

It's quite possible that some of the questions or posts on uncountable numbers of reddit posts may in fact be AI generated content. 

I could go on, but most people dont like to read super long posts without pictures. Please let me know if you'd like to hear more about my experience, thoughts, and ideas.
