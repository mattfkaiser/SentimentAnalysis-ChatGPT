That's right, the question is existential. It certainly felt better to have the smugness that we are chosen by god. 

Some of the findings related to unconscious thoughts seem to indicate that we humans could make decisions using an unconscious process, and only afterwards do we try to justify it with conscious thoughts. For example, an 2008 Nature study [https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2008.751](https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2008.751)  and an 2019 Nature study [https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/our-brains-reveal-our-choices-we%E2%80%99re-even-aware-them-study](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/our-brains-reveal-our-choices-we%E2%80%99re-even-aware-them-study). I recall Oliver Sacks talked about some anecdote, where a patient with good eyesight but brain damage can't consciously perceive an object yet will make decisions based on information from perception, and when asked to explain his decision, would offer some excuse to justify it, without utilizing the information from perception. All in all, this is not unlike ChatGPT solving a math problem and proceed to use human logic to show the steps. We know that's not how it actually goes about solving the math problem; it's just a way to persuade humans that the solution makes sense. I don't know if we are fundamentally that different in that regard.
