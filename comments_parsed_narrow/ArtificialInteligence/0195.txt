Ask chatgpt questions and at some point it starts hallucinating, giving you completely false information. Chatgpt is good at producing text. Just that. Google has a reputation to uphold. Chatgpt is NOT a reliable source of info. Google wants to be just that. Apples and pears. Just test chatgpt, ask it a bio of a not extremely well known person. You'll see what i mean.
