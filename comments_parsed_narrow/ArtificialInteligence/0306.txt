>it's built on the hard work of others outside of OpenAI, and that can't be ignored

can't agree more. It almost seems like they used other's innovations and packaged it together nicely with a ribbon on top and taught ChatGPT to not to give credits to anyone as they themselves want to hide it and partner with Microsoft as a "Side Scope" of their own business model.

>many of the so-called "quirks" noted back in February with Bing Chat and other systems have been happening for literally decades.

This is the sole reason why tech giants didn't want to throw their emotionally unstable junk at their consumers earlier. This is something I can say that is seen very less with GPT3 since it is a "well-behaved" model (or should I say well restricted) but I see it more in GPT4. These models still have the habit to lie confidently.

> that all OpenAI did was smooth out some of the worst problems with previous systems, use all that data to fill gaps in learning, bring everything together in a nicer package

Everything that we know or the Top tier researchers have speculated up till now doesn't seem as innovative as Altman speaks.

>OpenAI moved the conversation from creating chatbots from LLMs,

People do believe that this may just be a hype for marketing and revenue cuz thats what the main goal of these organizations are. They also partnered with Microsoft and change their own business model. 

I wonder if people will realize in the future that building a bot like ChatGPT from scratch is possible just by having a powerful processing machine. But I highly doubt that they will pull off such a risky move.
