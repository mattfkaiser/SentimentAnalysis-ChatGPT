The topic is "What makes so many AI experts so certain that LLMs like ChatGPT and LaMDA lack sentience?", so despite your attempt to reframe it, THIS DISCUSSION is about "LLMs like ChatGPT and LaMDA", rather than some hypothetical yet-to-be-realized "machine" that has yet to be invented.

I don't think it's impossible for any machine to be sentient, and would not argue that point. Human beings are a kind of complex machine, and I believe human beings are sentient. I don't believe LLMs, running on the CPUs and GPUs of today, are capable of sentience.
