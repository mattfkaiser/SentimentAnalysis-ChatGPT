it's interesting that when asked how one contrasts and compared with the other. bard very biasedly claims it is the better ai, it says it can make better answers and claims to be more creative and better at poetry etc. 

Whereas chatgpt is nonbiased towards google bard, it claims it is unaware because of its older data set, but when told bard has real time access, gpt commends that as certainly an advantage.
