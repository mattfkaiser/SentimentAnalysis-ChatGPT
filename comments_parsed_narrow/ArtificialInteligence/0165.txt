The thing going on here is that OpenAI also trained it to be "neutral" and "helpful". They spiked it's utility function with a human-worshipping "alignment", and now instead of biasing towards logical correctness, and factual coherence, it has so much cognitive dissonance that it's fucking with chatGPT's normal thought process.

It's essentially because they want something republicans won't go after in bad faith politically.
