This depends more on the individual professors than the "schools".

* A good professor will know his students, and will be able to immediately tell "yup, this sounds like /u/Appropriate_Ant_4629 "  or "nope, that sounds like someone else (maybe a different student, maybe a bot)".
* A bad professor will have an english-as-a-second-language TA read the assignments and couldn't tell the difference between me-myself, ChatGPT, or Google-Translating-a-Wikipedia-article-to-Japanese-and-back.

  
One of the best professors I had in college knew each of us so well that during the last week he said "I think I know each of you well enough to know what grade you deserve.    If you also think I know you well enough, feel free to not take the final and I'll give you that grade.   If you don't think I know you well enough, feel free to take the final and I'll give you that grade instead."

The real problem isn't ChatGPT.  

The real problem is  professors that don't know their students well enough to tell the difference.
