Large firms already have algorithms prior to chat gpt that would have these types of returns. The problem is they don’t work with the quantity that they need to invest with. 

So in theory if everyone on all scales is using chatgpt for sentiment ready and buy/selling than the same quantity will be in invested as if just a large firm. But then only the people with the fastest sentiment analysis and time to buy on the market will will. And even then they won’t be able to do it with more than x amount of money without moving the market and ruining the price point on the 500% return.
