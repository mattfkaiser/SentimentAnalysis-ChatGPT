I thought it was designed to do a lot of different things? Funny, you should say that because someone in another sub just posted a Bing Ai chat that was 7 months out of date on the same topic that I asked ChatGPT about. I'm sure these bots will improve on this sort of thing in time, though.

And I have done other things with ChatGPT at which it was very successful.
