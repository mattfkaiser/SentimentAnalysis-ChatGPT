We are working on adopting Botpress. This allows us to use our specific data along with public data to generate responses. The training is very simple - we give our files to the system, or links to our sites with information, and this knowledge immediately becomes available. The system looks for the answer in our internal documents, and if it doesn't find it, it returns the ChatGPT answer. Usually answer based on our own data is more relevant and correct for us.
