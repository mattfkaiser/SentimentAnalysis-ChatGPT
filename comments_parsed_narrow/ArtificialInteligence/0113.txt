it really depends what you're looking for. if you're looking to buy something from an affiliate link then definitely. If you're looking for the solution to a common coding problem (or just a refresher about the semantic of a specific programming language if you have to jump between those all the time), or a translation or basically anything else then ChatGPT is way faster and more convenient than Google, and just slightly more untruthful in most cases. 

Starting a search with ChatGPT and then potentially verifying it with duckduckgo or Brave Search (to avoid Google obnoxious bubbling) is definitely faster and more productive than a pure search-engine search.
