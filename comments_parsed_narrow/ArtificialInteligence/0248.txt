If I think about it, the furthest we could go is to replicate a human brain artificially. Now, imagine the process and imagine what process these projects must be in right now. Technologies like chatgpt must be 10 or 20 years behind the advances we can't see.  
Given that access to the brain would be remote, imagine what could be happening now.
