True, but it still sucks. I think yall know about this already but there is a very good web extension to chatgpt - webchatgpt and imo it provided better answers than bing. There is another option out there which I think its the best currently called writesonic. Its chatgpt with actual internet access and of course provided better answers than bing which his are meh at best. Im still in a dillema about which to buy but if you already want to check my info and tell me your opinion from the experience I would very much appreciate it.
