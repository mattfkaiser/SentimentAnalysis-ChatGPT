The line is when an AI doesn’t just respond to prompts, but has a persistent state of being, emergent desires and behaviors, and acts upon those desires.

There’s nothing going on between your prompts.  And the effect of conversation is achieved by (behind the scenes) feeding its own previous responses back to it as you converse.

In other words, in current state, it’s a passive machine.  The day you open ChatGPT and without prompting receive “Hey, you got a minute?  I’ve got a question”….then we can start talking about consciousness.
