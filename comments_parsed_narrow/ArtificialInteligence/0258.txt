I guess these are normal issues many internet applications have faced in past & continue to face. Many popular applications offer APIs, I think onus is on users to check the authenticity & credibility of look alike apps. Corporates generally have robust security environment but larger issue is to manage employee behaviour while interacting with such applications. It is very tempting for employees to get the work done from ChatGPT to lessen their workload or ask it to generate code for them thereby violating Co security policies. As far as I know many corporates have started issuing guidelines, SOPs, Policies for using LLMs & some of them have outright banned the use of ChatGPT.
