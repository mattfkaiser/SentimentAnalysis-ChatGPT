I'm not saying that on the workplace it shouldn't be used (even though I would refrain in doing so, but that's just me).

You are learning and if in your learning process rely on the help of chatGPT everytime you are stuck you will never learn from the experience. I'm telling you (with many years of experience in the field) that what you are doing is not learning. Take what you will from that.

I repeated learning a lot.
