"you don't know what you don't know" but with python, if you simply build everything that chatgpt suggests in small chunks, you can see where things break and stress test them to confirm chatgpt's assumptions. Then even is something breaks later because of a bad architectural choice, you can just go back to an earlier step in the build and rebuild with the knowledge of what went wrong (eg wrong data structure).
