I've been using Coursera to walk me through things. It's good for the most part, but some explanation are rushed or not demonstrated well.  


I started using ChatGPT to ask about places where I'm confused and it has made a tremendous impact already. Not sure if it's just because it is being explained to me in a specific way that I ask for, but I feel like I can better tackle my own coding projects after one day of use. I'm excited to use it as a learning tool.
