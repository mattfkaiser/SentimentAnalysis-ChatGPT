Please do not be discouraged. I am a professional software engineer, and I can promise that effective software engineering will have its place for at least the next 50 years. While some of the toy app writing will likely be possible by chat gpt or similar software, the real R&D is safe in your lifetime.

Keep at it, please, we need good engineers, and there is never enough of them. I do hiring interviews at my company, and I get one decent candidate out of 50. Have the knowledge and skills to be that one, and you will have job security for life.   

I made a post on acquiring those skills here https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10i81ux/comment/j5f0v9z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
