I’ve actually be using it to learn how to code! 

I’ve struggled to teach myself to programming in the past because I have a hard time learning from just reading things on the internet. But with chatGPT I can have it show me example code, explain it, and answer any questions with more examples. 

I’ve also been using it to try new recipes and create dnd characters, including backstories and gimmicks
