You can learn to code something in a few months to a year to be somewhat comfortable, the more you learn the more you will feel like you're new again. But that's part of the learning process, and you get comfortable by trying and figuring things out. 

I'll slightly disagree about chat gpt helping you learn code, it's closer to googling and you do learn some things but it's not like learning from a tutorial, or a linkedin resource. Sometimes it is not that accurate so don't rely on it 100%, use it sparingly with other resources.
