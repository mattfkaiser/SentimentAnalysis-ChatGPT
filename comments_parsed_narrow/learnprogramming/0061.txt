You are focusing too much on what it is today. You are not looking at the potential and possibilities. This is why I am amazed at chatGPT because it opened my eyes to the possibilities. 

Also think of chatGPT as a 3 year old (in AI years). If a 3 year old can do all these, imagine what a 10 year old will be capable of.
