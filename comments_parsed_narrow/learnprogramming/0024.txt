ChatGPT has the limited capability of "understanding" language, so it's not just searching for keywords and their synonyms, this is why you can ask it to perform a list of commands (if you word the list right) or to refactor some code or sentence or to mix something with a given style. Google doesn't have those capabilities as it's just a data index with some fancy search function.
