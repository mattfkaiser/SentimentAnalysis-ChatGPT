TL;DR: ChatGPT can be a useful tool for beginners to learn coding, but it shouldn't be used as a crutch. It can be helpful for asking questions and getting guidance, but it's important to not rely too heavily on it. While it may save time in searching for examples and documentation, it's important to still practice writing code on your own. ChatGPT can serve as a helpful teacher and search engine, but it's not infallible and may provide incorrect information. Overall, AI like ChatGPT can have a significant role in the teaching industry, but it's important to use it appropriately and critically evaluate its responses.
