If you use it in a way that you can actually learn from then it’s not terrible. Ex: “show me how to architect a database that can do x, y, and z”. It will show you the steps and the code. Rather than copy/paste, type it out or use the tools you would normally use to build it. Many of us are using chatgpt to do menial tasks for us which we’ve otherwise been doing by hand for years, so it’s not a detriment to our growth by any means. But starting out with this notion that a tool will do everything for you is going to seriously hamstring you in the near future. 

It’s like when brand new devs come along and immediately want to find the “best JavaScript framework in 2023”. You’ll learn how to do framework things without ever learning the core concepts behind them and in the end you will cripple yourself.
