I asked ChatGPT the following thing:

> should chat gpt be used for learning

It's answer was:

> It depends on the context and the specific use case. GPT-3, which is a large language model trained by OpenAI, can be used to generate text that is similar to human language. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as language translation, text summarization, and content generation. However, GPT-3 is not designed to be used as a learning tool. It does not have the ability to provide explanations or in-depth information about a topic, and it cannot interact with users in a way that supports learning. If you are looking for a tool to help you learn, I would recommend using other educational resources that are specifically designed for that purpose.

So yeah, I think it agrees with our discussion.
