Reminds me of how my teachers used to “teach” by putting on an educational video. Teachers haven’t been teaching for a long time. It’s a tough job and they need to make it easier for themselves. They usually felt the need to pause every 5 minutes and correct the video like, “he said blue, of course the correct answer is navy” or something pointless to make themselves feel like they were doing something.

Of course, my actually good teachers didn’t do this. I don’t see ChatGPT *inspiring* me. But it sure can replace a certain type of teacher which honestly is a pretty common type.
