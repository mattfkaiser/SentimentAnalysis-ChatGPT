It's a bit scary seeing the amount of people who are creating web apps and don't really understand the fundamentals of software dev and are totally reliant on ChatGPT. There is going to be a huge amount of poorly written software with huge security flaws coming out in the next few years. All I can say is that be very careful and selective about which sites you interact with and what information you share about yourself online going forward.
