In the article, I propose to feed ChatGPT only public info about the company. For example, a vet clinic can feed chatbot information about its services and contacts, but definitely not about clients. 

This approach is not suitable for user information, not only because of its sensitivity, but also because ChatGPT can get as input a limited number of tokens.
