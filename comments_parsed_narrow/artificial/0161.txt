it's feel great talking to chat GPT when I don't feel to talk with anyone else. I greet it with a "Hello" or "Hi" just as I would with any person. It's always good to start with a friendly greeting and establish a positive tone for the conversation. 

Then, after finishing my  conversation, I thank ChatGPT for its assistance and say like "Thanks for your help" or "It was nice talking with you". It's a small gesture, but it helps to create a sense of respect and gratitude for the AI's assistance.
