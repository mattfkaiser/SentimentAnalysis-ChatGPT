well actually as far as I am concern you are not able to use any alternatives instead of ChatGPT cause , there is no new AI API in the industry now.

All the new one you see are using the chatgpt prompts in there AI foundation and just giving it a new name so that you might think that it is a new AI like chat gpt

but no they copy the syntex cause it is open patent for everyone who has corporate license in the industry.
