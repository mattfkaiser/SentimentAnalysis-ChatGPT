Watched the Lex Friedman podcast on this where he spoke to the creator of wolfram alpha. 

You may not know this, but the wolfram alpha AI uses it’s own language to communicate with itself and perform executive functions.

The creator described that what’s special with this plugin is how ChatGPT is able to translate normal human language into a very specific language created for an artificial intelligence with high levels of accuracy, and then take that output from WrA and translates it back into normal human language. 

He claimed this was pretty revolutionary as he’d been working on this exact concept for decades. In fact, it was the entire founding idea behind WrA if I remember correctly. 

Just food for thought.
