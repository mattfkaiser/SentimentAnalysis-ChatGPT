There is a difference between 100% private (no entity other than chatGPT system accessing encryption keys), 99% private (admins having access to encryption keys), and 0% private (no encryption keys for inputs and no encryption for the database => all devs reading conversations without needing any special rights for accessing encryption keys). I even read the conversations titles of a guy wanting to buy insurance agencies one day. => i do not trust their security policy at all.

Encryption ensures a certain degree of privacy, but i never said the word privacy in my post, nor that 100% privacy is possible. But the most encryption there is, the better it is (example end-to-end message applications are better than non-encrypted messages applications for your privacy, cf. Facebook, Google etc VS whatsapp, Signal etc)
