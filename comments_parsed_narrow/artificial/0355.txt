I would disagree about on ChatGPT. Because it‘s default role is being an assistant and acting like it. 

If you give another role say space ship captain and tweak it further it’s way harder to break.

What I personally also feel a little bit overlooked is that a conversation with an AI ignores body language.
Basically language let you Interpret a lot of meaning an emotions in letters that are often not there.

The sound of a voice, the body language maybe would make a more complete test. 

But in general I feel it is a bit outdated to try to mimic humans.
