"In many cases i've tried" does not mean it doesn't have a pretty good success rate. You are clearly an AI enthusiast, and by the way you are talking, i'd say it's a safe bet you probed it with significantly more difficult questions than the average person would, no doubt questions you thought it would likely struggle on. Which is fine, and of course it's good to test AI's in difficult situations. But difficult situations are not necessarily normal, nor representative of most. The large majority of text that a normal person types into ChatGPT will be dealt with adequately, if not entirely human like. 

If we took the top 1000 questions typed into Google and removed the ones for which are about things that happened after ChatGPT's data set post 2021, the overwhelming majority would be understood and answered.
