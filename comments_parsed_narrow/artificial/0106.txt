ChatGPT taught me more in a few days than my professor did in a whole semester. Like if I had my professor on speed dial and he's available 24/7 sure - he will likely give more accurate and detailed answers for extremely technical questions in a specific field, but otherwise ChatGPT wins in the sheer breadth of knowledge and the constant availability.
