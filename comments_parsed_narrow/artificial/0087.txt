People talking about the emotional aspect of it, but the thing I find most impressive is that chatGPT actually understands what you're saying and you don't have to argue 30 minutes of semantics to get to the heart of the question you ask.

If I need to explain some abstract math question and ask someone who's really good at it. I ALWAYS get 3 wrong answers due to a misunderstanding before getting the one I'm looking for.

Because that person is an expert and I don't even know the names or terms to describe the things that I'm describing. The way they think about the subject doesn't even come close to how I think about it and always results in issues.

But if I ask chatgpt, it just rewords my question and gives me the answer.
