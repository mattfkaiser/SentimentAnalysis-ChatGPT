Perple... what?? Does that pos still exist? That's the thing I tried using when I was waiting for my Bing invite, but it was utter shit. Then I found You.com, and that one was 1000x better.

Nowadays I'm only using ChatGPT or Bing (when new info after 2021 is required). But You.com is *almost* as good as Bing. If I didn't have Bing access, I'd still be using You.com.
