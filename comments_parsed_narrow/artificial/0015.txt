I know what I'm talking about. The input is not encrypted because it is an AI model taking tokens in input (non encrypted). So your security, about your personal data, is relying on Open AI politics. And already many young people and even adults are talking to chatGPT about their personal life. There is no end to end encryption of conversations. So you are not the only one to have the keys to encrypt/decrypt your conversation with ChatGPT and all researchers have access to users conversations and people are talking about their whole life and personal problems to chat GPT, associated with a tel number and email address etc, which can lead to very important data leaks for your personal life.
