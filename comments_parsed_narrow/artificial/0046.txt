Ah, the joys of pedantry! The 'linguistic vigilance' was a cheeky nod to your keen eye for detail in parsing the title's phrasing. You're right in that the underlying technology (the plugin) enables the mathematical ability, but in common usage, we often refer to the whole system (ChatGPT + plugin) as having that capability. Just as we would not pick apart the individual contribution of each component in the examples I've provided.

But I must commend you, truly. Not everyone can turn a discussion on AI capabilities into a riveting discourse on semantics and attribution. Here's to you, guardian of precise language! Keep fighting the good fight.
