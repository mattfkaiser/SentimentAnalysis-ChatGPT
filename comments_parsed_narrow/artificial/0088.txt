I'l say though, ChatGPT is *goddawful* at moderately complex codebase-specific coding questions. I can give it the code, context, and explain my problem, but like 90% of the time it defaults to what the problem *looks* like rather than what it is. I'm guessing that's because there are tonnes of newbie questions and answers on StackOverflow it consumed, but extremely few on the specific problems I was having.
