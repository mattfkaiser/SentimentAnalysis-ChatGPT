Well, chatGPT doesn't need you to know this, and moreover will probably teach you those keywords by itself. Also, it gives personal advice to your very specific problem, rather than you having to look for general solutions that need you to have the skill to understand and apply to your problem. It's like making a post on stackoverflow and have someone answer every time, except without fear of being made fun of.

Exactly this is my point I agree with what you said and already mentioned it above I apologize if this did not come through, english is my 3rd language anyway. 

My point is that the "fame" and "buzz" it got is not equal for what it can do I mean people talk about chatGPT as if we are one step away from a total conscious machine or something... while it is a glorified google search engine that can synthesize text not much better than siri or whatever else is out there does but it can search the web better compared to them ok I give it that.
