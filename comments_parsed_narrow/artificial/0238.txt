As an experiment I once prompted chatGPT to specifically act as a doctor speaking to a hypochondriac who is particularly anxious about seemingly innocuous symptoms. It did a really great job at giving nuanced answers to questions without doing the webMD things of "or it is cancer". I cant recall the exact prompt and dont know if it would still work but try something along those lines to see what it gives you.
