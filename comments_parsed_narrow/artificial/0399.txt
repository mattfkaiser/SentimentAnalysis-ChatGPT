Neeva.com It seems like they just released their AI publicly. It's basically a search engine that gives you an ai generated response, but it's not great compared to chatgpt and I assume the new Bing. It's focused on accuracy, so if it's not confident in the answer it won't give you a chat reaponse and it is not conversational, so there is no thread and you just have to do a new search every time. Honestly more of a search engine with an ai bot tacked on. Seems the New Bing will remain the king for a bit. You.com definitely has some problems with scaling i only get a response about a third of the time. It can't carry a thread for more than two questions without being unable to respond. Microsoft has a strong lead right now I would say. They have the money and infrastructure to make it very hard to compete with for relatively small companies trying to do the same thing. Startups will have to heavily innovate to make it anywhere in this space and that will certainly happen and I can't wait to see it.
