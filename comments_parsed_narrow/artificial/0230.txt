Depends what you do.

I use it to goof off with friends.  Ask it to make a short story about aliens, robots and dinosaurs, and have a twist ending.

I use it to make templates for documents without searching Google which at this point because absurd trying to find a simple template without boatloads of ads.

I generate replies to emails that I'm not interested in doing manually.

I am trying to keep my written Norwegian from getting too rusty so sometimes I've asked chatgpt to help me with that.
