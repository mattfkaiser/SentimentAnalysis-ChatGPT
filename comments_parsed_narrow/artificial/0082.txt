Two things:

1. Chat GPT did nothing wrong, it operated as designed. The onus was on the Lawyer to proofread and fact check the document for inconsistencies. Shitty lawyer, not shitty program. 

2. As soon as a version of chatGPT that can browse the internet and look up credible articles and court cases exists, problems like these will probably disappear. Versions like this exist, but soon they're going to be the norm rather than the exception.
