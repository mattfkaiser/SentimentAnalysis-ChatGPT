ChatGPT has all the time you need and you can ask follow up questions. I was always afraid to say anything to my teachers because “We just went over this, where have you been all class?”

So much easier to just say “ChatGPT, can you dumb it down a notch? Can you remind me what Ribosomes are? What do you mean by Boolean?” Doesn’t matter if it just explained it to you 2 seconds ago and your brain tossed it out like old milk, ChatGPT isn’t gonna judge or label you as a problem student. Sounds pretty ideal, and I say this as someone whose dad was a teacher (he’d probably be furious to hear me say that).
