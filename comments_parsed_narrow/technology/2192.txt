I just learned how to use it to assign images from a 2dimentional array to an array that has 25 lists and each of those lists have 9 elements that are numbers 0-3. I have an array that has 25 lists inside of it with 9 elements each. each of the numbers within the lists inside of the array corresponds to the row and column inside the 2dimenonal array

Nobody else could have taught me that as efficiently and quick as the chatGPT.
