And once again engineers won’t get no help: tell me when ChatGPT can e.g. construct things in CAD that work flawlessly.

Most of my hardest projects for university as an automotive engineer were constructions… and then offline exams where you solve differential equations… and then experiments at the university lab.

I’m happy and unhappy at the same time, that KI won’t help with my job in the near future.
