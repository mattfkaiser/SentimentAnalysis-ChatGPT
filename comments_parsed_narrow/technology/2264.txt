I suppose it depends on what people think the goal of education is. 

Like do you believe it’s just to memorise as much as you can for some test that you’ll likely forget after taking, or do we take the more open book approach and test that people are capable of understanding topics and finding answers. 

I am a fan of the latter, it matters not how you get the information as long as you understand it. Things like ChatGPT are tools to complement your role, studies etc. just like Encarta 98 was a tool that probably stopped a lot of people going checking out books for a while.l
