As an IT lead, I think it’s a phenomenal helper if you’re already a subject matter expert. 

I can ask it to generate a new helpdesk or cybersecurity policy and it does so in seconds. I review it as I would with an assistant and adjust as needed.

Need content for a presentation or an email announcement for a new tech service to the organization? ChatGPT does it in seconds.

Quick research as well. Say I know nothing about digital transformation. Instead of reading 10 blog articles where someone is trying to sell me on something or it’s from their specific viewpoint, ChatGPT presents a general consensus on all of the knowledge out there on the subject. I can ask follow up questions and it seems to understand how to present additional details on a subtopic. 

To me, it‘s freeing up cycles that I would end up reinventing the wheel on something someone out there has already done a million times and allows me to focus on the work of applying knowledge specifically to my organization’s unique challenges. 

Would I ask it relationship questions? Heeeeell naw but I think it hits the nail on the head especially in technical industries where there is significant consensus on best practice and where we’re all already pulling from the same bodies of knowledge.
