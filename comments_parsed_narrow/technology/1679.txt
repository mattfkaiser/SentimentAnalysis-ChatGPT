Perhaps, but on the other hand, the makers of ChatGPT have the right to control their product and stop it from being used in ways that they don't approve of. If you don't like it, you don't have to use it.

The last thing that they want is to generate something really offensive and trying to force them to do otherwise seems like it violates their right to free speech.

I hate to point this out to you, but this exists everywhere, including most media and this site. If you don't believe me, try posting a call to murder a well-known politician. My guess is that any respectable platform would refuse and many would throw you off. Would you be happier if it was generating stories about neo-nazis committing racial cleansing?
