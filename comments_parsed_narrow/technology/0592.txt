I use it fairly often, for evaluation.  If you use the Bing integrated ChatGPT it can search legal cases. Also when it spouts a lie it doesn’t keep that li in context, so you can ask it more questions to determine if a specific piece of information is factual.

I’m not saying that I would use ChatGPT this way if I had a legal practice, I’m just saying it is possible to use the tool better than this guy.
