I just replied to another comment about it but, I imagine it will contribute to layoffs eventually but companies I work with are still cautiously testing it.  Maybe some startups are moving a little quicker or I'm just not seeing a full sample size personally but I'd be surprised if current or recent layoffs are related to chatgpt in a major way.
