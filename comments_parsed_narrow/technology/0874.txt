“For some workers, this impact is already here. Those who write marketing and social media content are in the first wave of people being replaced with tools such as chatbots, which are seemingly able to produce plausible alternatives to their work.

Experts say that even advanced AI doesn’t match the writing skills of a human: It lacks personal voice and style, and it often churns out wrong, nonsensical or biased answers. But for many companies, the cost-cutting is worth a drop in quality.”

Companies willing to give up on quality is on the wrong path.

If a manager thinks he can do a writer’s job with ChatGPT by cutting the job that manager to save the company some money, this is not a company you want to a part of. 🤦

Should provide the writer with the “tool”, so he/she can be even better at the job. The mental exercise at these companies is mind blowing.
