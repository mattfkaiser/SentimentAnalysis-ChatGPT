> As a software developer, and chatgpt user, I don't understand this. 
  
As a software developer and entrepreneur, I can explain. The CEO of freshworks.com is using this exaggerated claim to get publicity for his IT services company. He wants to get contracts for his company, no doubt he can source the developers cheaply. By claiming that his company has mastered the hot new AI tech and used it to reduce costs that are passed on to the customer (implied), his article gets views from people who want to get the feeling they are getting a good deal. There is of course no way for any prospects to investigate this before they buy, so he can promise whatever he wants. You sign up, once you're engaged in a service contract you have to keep paying until you get a product.   
  
Having worked in several tech industries from different regions, I find some cultures rely more on Total Bullshit than others. From my small sample set, Indians and Israelis are chef's kiss excellent at it, the Dutch and Germans tend to be pathologically honest.
