Disagree.  I am using ChatGPT already over Google Search in areas where Google search just fails or can't provide a reasonable/efficient set of search results that maximizes my time.

I dont want to spend 30 minutes sifting through StackOverflow or Quora search results when ChatGPT can give me the correct answer to my specific set of problems in just 30 seconds.  


Also, MSFT is far from a dinosaur.  Just look at their stock price as a proxy for their advancements, where over the last 10 years they have seen 10x growth.
