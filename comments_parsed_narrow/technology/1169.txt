Exactly correct. I am in grad school atm and one class is basically a roundtable discussion of current papers and during my presentation (on the topic I'm studying) someone put a question I didn't know the answer to (litteraly the question of my study lol) into chatGPT and it came out with some good sounding info that was convincing, yet ENTIRELY wrong and fabricated. It gave an answer to the very thing that nobody knows how this mechanism works. 

ChatGPT isn't as good as people have made it out to be in my experience. It's good at basic things but once you get into complex topics it really isn't that good. Okay for writing, bad at being Google
