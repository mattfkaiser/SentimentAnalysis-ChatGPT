And something that everyone needs to understand is that no matter how "easy" programming is made, you can't just sit anyone down and have them write a good application. 

The only thing this is really dangerous for is "code-monkey" positions and even then, it's only dangerous because it can make that position more manageable with less people.

VS2022 already contains an AI model. It's nowhere near the sophistication of ChatGPT sure but the concept is already in use. Even if the code is auto-generated, it requires a lot of checks and verification from knowledgeable people.

I asked Chat GPT to write me a signal downsampling algorithm. It generated an extremely basic but at least usable function. I asked Chat GPT to write functions to calculate certain statistics on sample sets of data. It did okay until we got to specific requests like "write me a function that can find the three largest values that make up at least 10% of the samples of a given data set" at which point it errored out and could not process the request. Regardless, it could be an incredible tool to auto-generate function archetypes and boiler-plate, which would drastically reduce the tediousness of writing code.
