 But we keep getting the BS “ChatGPT is better than” literally pick your target. It’s been lawyers, doctors, fund managers, HR professionals, software developers, mid level managers. No joke, every week I see a new article attacking some profession out there. It’s nearing hysterics with literally no practical application and a dataset that’s laughable in each scenario. Then when it’s challenged by said profession the target is moved and the conversation dropped. Lawyers already defended themselves, as did doctors, devs etc. I’m watching this pretty closely because there’s so much corporate interest in it but I’m not seeing the positive value yet. I’m sure it will come at some point, but I’m not interested in the click bait BS anymore.
