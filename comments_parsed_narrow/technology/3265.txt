I asked ChatGPT to write an essay about Romeo and Juliet on any topic and it decided to explore religion.  It said the Capulets are Catholics and the Montagues are Protestants, which sounds kinda right to a layman but has no basis in the text. If I weren’t a Shakespeare nerd, I wouldn’t have caught that. The only people who should use ChatGPT to write stuff are people who are already experts in whatever topic it is being used for. Using it to replace people entirely would be disastrous.
