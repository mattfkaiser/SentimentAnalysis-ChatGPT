I dunno. I've seen some interesting and frankly creative responses from chat gpt. I asked it to tell the story of a dog that runs weird. It invented the story of a dog who runs with his back leg lifted in the air and different adventures he got involved in. Then I asked it to write a scientific paper about him and it wrote about how the dog was studied using small mirrors on his body to capture a 3d model of his gait and a variety of different details about the way he ran. At the end I almost felt like I was reading about a real dog. 

Definitely it's not perfect. Many times it's really predictable. Any stories it tells are very formulaic. It has yet to make me laugh. Seems it hasn't figured out humor. But sometimes it comes up with stuff that surprises you.
