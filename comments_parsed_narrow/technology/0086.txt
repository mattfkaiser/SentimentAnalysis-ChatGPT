If you want to know what type of workers chatGPT and other AI will eventually replace, ask yourself if the job relies on creative problem solving. That is what I believe AI cannot and will likely never be able to replicate. 

I’m enjoying the current tech scene because it brings up questions like “what exactly is intuition?”, or, “what does it mean to creative?”
