I spend most of my energy at work helping out development teams keep their code secure. The subsidiary who does the majority of our development time has shifted a shit load of their traffic from GitHub and Stackoverflow to ChatGPT. 

I’m in the camp that we’re still relying on copied code regardless of where it’s coming from. 

Still a risk, but the same risk IMO. A good DevOps process manages this risk. 

This mostly impacts folks learning new things.
