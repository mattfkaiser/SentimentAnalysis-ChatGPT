Say it with me: You have no idea who I am.

I work in tech. I embrace technology and think that any advancement can be beneficial.

That being said, how "people like you" are basically gargling openAI's balls and accepting this new technology so blindly without taking a step back and seriously looking at how problematic the blind acceptance of this is, IS the problem.

Who controls it? What biases are put into it? How does money play into it?

Fuck....do you even know the current saying "If it's free, you're the product"? Does it not event bother you a little bit that it's basically a black box?

Here's a top about who I am: The lack of any critical thought and discernment being done by people with this tool WILL make it just another Twitter or Facebook. "It's on ChatGPT...it MUST be true!!!"
