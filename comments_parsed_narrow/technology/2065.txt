Labs (practical application) are required course work for literally everyone in any science field until the day you graduate and internships are often required (depends on the major). Also no one is literally leading the team from day one. Where did I say that? 

There's what you know, what you don't know, and what you don't realize you don't know. That last one? It is a horrifying, nigh-endless abyss that no one person can fill; that's why people specialize. A scientist or engineer's job is to build a plank there for the next person. And you want them not to have the first one full on their own ability because you think chatGPT should fill in the blanks. But a calculator is useless if you don't know the equations. You can have the fanciest tech in world; it won't help if you don't know how it works.

But go ahead. Ask some guy at any R&D department if they have the time and resources to train someone from scratch. See how that goes.

Also tell an aerospace engineer that cone surface area is "brain dump information" if you want biggest verbal bitch slapping you've ever experienced. Or to just get laughed at. Depends on their mood.

My point is you do not know what you're talking about.

At all.
