Yesterday, I got a scary taste as to how ChatGPT and its ilk are going to change things.

I was discussing housing construction with someone right here on Reddit. This person theorized that building is more advanced these days, and that you need more specialized crews to build a house. 

I asked him to give some examples of this - because I couldn't think of too many complex advancements that houses have, except for maybe insulation - that most advancements seemed to be time-saving (using nail guns, joist hangers, etc.) The other poster basically said "I don't know, but I asked ChatGPT and this is what it said" - and ChatGPT vomited out some stuff that sounded semi-plausible, but without a lot of detail. 

For example, one of the responses of more advanced building was "advanced roofing systems", requiring "roofing technology specialists". This was more or less nonsense - most houses aren't installing imitation slate roofs.

However, the introduction of ChatGPT completely transformed the discussion. In my opinion, it short-circuited it to an end - because **how do you argue with AI**? It's like the classic car salesperson negotiation - "My manager, in the back room, said this - I'm sorry, I have no power to negotiate with you, his word is the truth".

The discussion was over. AI had spoken, this was the truth, no more discussion.
