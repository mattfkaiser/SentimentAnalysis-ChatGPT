I was talking with someone I used to build php sites with and we had completely different viewpoints on the whole thing. He seems to not want to use it at all and instead rely on learned knowledge and thinks it amounts to cheating his intelligence. Like somehow if he's using it, that means he has thrown away all his knowledge. 

I have been using Chat GPT to fill in my memory gaps and do all the auto layout stuff and augment stuff after checking that it works. There's a lot of test and refine involved. My forte has always been front end though, so it compliments my deficiencies. I think if you have a sufficient knowledge in a certain field, GPT just bumps you to that next level because you know what to ask for. It's like the difference between regular staff and IT staff with Google. Most people just don't know how to use Google properly, but in the right hands it's like a superpower.
