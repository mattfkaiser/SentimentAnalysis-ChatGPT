Amateur coder here

Stack overflow fucking sucks. I would ask a question, even remove any relation to what I need help with and I would get a snarky response of "looks like homework".


Chatgpt doesn't judge. It helps. I learn from reading code written by someone else and adapting it, eventually learning anything else I need.
