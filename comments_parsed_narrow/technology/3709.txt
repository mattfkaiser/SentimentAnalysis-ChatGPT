they're probably wondering how many of their writers are already AI. 

most "journalism" has become pithy expansions on someone's tweet or press release. if I was a writer for a magazine and my boss/editor said "write me a X-length article about Y press-release", I would just sit up in my beach chair, copy-paste that request, the magazine's style guide, and press-release into ChatGPT, Bard, and other AIs and see which I liked the most. then, do a bit of editing and set a timed email to go out at the end of the day, then lay back down in my beach chair.
