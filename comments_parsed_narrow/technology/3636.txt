I tried some creative writ9ng woth ChatGPT, after hours of trying different prompts to get what I wanted, it couldn't write anything that wasn't clearly derivative of Twilight and ended every paragraph with "character felt this way, but couldn't shake the feeling that (big plot point) was coming or something along those lines. It'll be pretty easy to spot I think.
