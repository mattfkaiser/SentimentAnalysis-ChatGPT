Ok. 

First of all, this thing uses a time horizon or 2 months to conclude that chatgpt is better than your fund manager? That’s stupid. 

Secondly, of course chatgpt is better then your fund manager, fund managers are awful (after fees). 

We have already empirically proven that a monkey throwing darts at a stock dartboard is going to outperform your fund manager, if we assume the monkey system is free or close to free. So… yeah?

Just buy index stocks guys.
