Honestly, tools like that should be used like ChatGPT itself, as a starting point.

If people use something a student came up with over the holidays(from the article) to flunk someone, there is something wrong.

Frankly if someone came up with a surefire way to detect AI generated text it should be front page news considering how much of it is likely being used online. But I'll eat my own foot if it works with more then specific writing styles that are part of larger text posts(not to mention the false positives of people who just write poorly)
