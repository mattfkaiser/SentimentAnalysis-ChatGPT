ChatGPT does not do "deep information processing" in the context of the essay, or synthesize, interpret, or draw connections.

It very convincingly gives the illusion of having done so, creating fake references and incorrect / fallacious connections if necessary. It will happily prove mathematical contradictions if you ask it to or explain why the world is flat.

But your conclusion is the same as mine; the point of school writing assignments is to test your ability to form an argument, regardless of whether the argument is correct (that comes in the STEM side of learning). ChatGPT torpedoes this sort of test because it demonstrate what looks like a thought process; but where a student will over time hone their skills to begin making correct, well justified arguments ChatGPT will spew BS until the end of time because AI is not any closer to actually synthesizing or creating than Elizabot was.
