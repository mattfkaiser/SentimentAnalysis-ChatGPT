This is not the way.

I saw a TikTok from a teacher who was prepping for a lesson using ChatGPT. Students would form groups with specific essay topics which they would produce using ChatGPT as the first draft writer. Students then would dissect the essay, evaluate it and identify issues or deficiencies with the essay.

Students could then rewrite the essay either themselves, or hone their prompts to ChatGPT to produce a better essay than the original.

A cat and mouse game against AI is not going to end well. Especially in the education field where change is always at a glacially slow pace.
