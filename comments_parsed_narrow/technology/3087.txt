Once you have spent a fortune training a huge model, it can be used as the basis for many future models via very lost cost fine-tuning and embeddings.

The revised models do not always need to be as capable as *ChatGPT4* ... thye can be configured for niche/dedicated tasks where they will be able to be very useful.
