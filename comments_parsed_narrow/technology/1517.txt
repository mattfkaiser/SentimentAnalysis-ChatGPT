This and the comment you responded to sum up my thoughts well. We are living in an era when irresponsible tech giants have used algorithms within social media (and nearly everything else at this point) to disrupt society much for the worse because they are fundamentally unable or unwilling to think of the consequences. Yet, so many people are willing to go along with this new scheme despite the fact that AI isn’t fully autonomous, someone had to make and maintain it, and those people are seemingly unable or unwilling to address the serious issues their programs have yet again made. I don’t want chatGPT becoming the norm for all writing because I don’t trust that it isn’t going to result in serious issues down the line when someone decides to monetize or weaponize the system, or at the very least is too incompetent to address very real biases and problems it might have.
