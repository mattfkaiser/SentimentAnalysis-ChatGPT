ChatGPT and other AI technologies used in the realm of a health information system seems to open the potential for medical errors. As a former scribe EMRs require providers to spend a lot of time inputting information, but it is all for the good of the patient. EMRs already prepopulated information into the chart and sometimes it isnâ€™t the correct information. All the information must be reviewed by the provider signing the chart but if everything was automatic this leaves room for so much human error in reviewing the document, or at the very least an exhausted physician who skims the note. EMRs have many safety nets to protect patient privacy and installing an AI technology that does what you tell it to allow for potential sharing or exporting of patient information. I do think there are a lot of benefits of using AI in healthcare and will change the future of healthcare but knowing where the lines should be drawn is extremely important.
