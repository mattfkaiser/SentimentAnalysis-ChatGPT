I'm curious about this too. I use ChatGPT to rewrite my writings, so it barely changes things, but it sounds better. Uses synonyms and proper grammar. But the detector I used still finds out I used it. I don't understand how or why it actually matters. It's like an automated grammar fixer for my uses. Is that actually plagiarism?
