For just one of my CS classes every week we have to read 130 textbook pages, do a 10 hour question set, go to in person lecture and watch supplementory lectures. No one has time to do hand written notes anymore, its just not feasible.

Tools like this would make it easier to digest this information. No matter how good ChatGPT geets, it won't help you at all on an exam. But the notes and summarizing it does can help you learn faster and more efficiently.
