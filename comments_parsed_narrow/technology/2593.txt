When reading comments, there are a few signs that might indicate it was written by ChatGPT. Firstly, if the comment seems devoid of context or specific information, that could be a red flag. Secondly, the language may appear too polished or formal, lacking a natural flow. Thirdly, if the information presented is incorrect or incomplete, that may indicate a non-human response. Finally, if the comment appears too concise, factual, and lacking in emotion, this may suggest that it was generated by a machine.
