Did someone have those roles when “developing the human brain”?

It’s like saying Hitlers exterminations and warfare could never happen because he could not do all of it by himself... He would need to be a general, a weapons engineer and all the million roles that were needed to make the 3rd reich run…

Humans will gladly hop onboard the AI gravy train and do all the roles needed to propel AI forward, with the hope that doing so will make their own lives better.

While those roles you are mentioning would streamline the process. The development of AI is going to happen with the most tried and tested method of all.

Random errors and live user testing = natural selection. 

It will be messy. Most projects will fail. It will not be just within one software company.

There will be millions of variations of chatGPT out there as people improve on it. Those that improve survive and help build the next million improvements. 

The evolution of AI will be much closer to a biology evolution than a software development.

The only thing that we can be sure of that the AI next year will be better than the AI this year. And now that AI can help improve code the improvements can be even faster than before. that in the end will lead to way way stronger AI and it will happen way faster than expected.

All with human help
