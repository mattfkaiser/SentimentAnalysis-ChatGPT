It will always apologize if you call it out on a mistake, even if it wasn't a mistake. It won't immediately learn from corrections (i.e. your correction wont make its way to my version of the model), but the data will be used to optimize the model in newer iterations. However, chatGPT has a local memory, so it probably remembered your correction and chose another answer this time (I suppose this is all the same chat?)
