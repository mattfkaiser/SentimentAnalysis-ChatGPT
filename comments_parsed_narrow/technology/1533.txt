There are some things that chatGPT by virtue of what it actually is won’t be able to do any time soon. People keep calling it AI, but it’s machine learning. So it’s unable to come up with something completely new, and more importantly, it’s not able to come up with anything personal. My students are probably going to have to include something personal in their essays going forward.
