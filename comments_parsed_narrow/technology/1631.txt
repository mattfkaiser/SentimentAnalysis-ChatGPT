A lot of these comments sound to me like coders are genuinely worried/scared. When ChatGPT passed a biz school exam or law school entrance exam, the comments I saw were disparaging to those who pursued those fields. "MBAs are useless." "Anyone with half a brain can get into law school." I don't think any job, especially coding, is safe from AI automation and we're probably going to see the entire workforce dramatically transformed in the next 5 to 10 years.
