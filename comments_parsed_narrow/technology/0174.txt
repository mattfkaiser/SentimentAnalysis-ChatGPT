That’s massively irresponsible of him. Even the detection software’s results are highly circumstantial. A sound case can usually be made if a student did use AI to generate a paragraph, but this is not how you do it. If you A/B the vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure against a sample of the student’s known writing, that usually gives them dead away. Usually they confess when confronted, but when they don’t it’s even more work to prove the case because you need to be sure. I burned a weekend recently to process 3 cheaters I caught using ChatGPT. The one who did not confess took me all day to build my case because it’s not something to treat lightly especially without an admission.
