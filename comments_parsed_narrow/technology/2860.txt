The genie is already out of the bottle. Today represents the most basic language model AI will ever be; itâ€™s only going to become more capable from here on out.

In the same way calculators take out of the bulk of the labour of doing math, AI like this will do the same for writing. I kinda wish I was still in secondary school to see how much I could get away with using ChatGPT to do the work for me.

Public education has largely remained stagnant for a century. Trying to find workarounds to stop tech like this automating writing exercises is as pointless as hoping education is going to change until it eventually gets automated away too.
