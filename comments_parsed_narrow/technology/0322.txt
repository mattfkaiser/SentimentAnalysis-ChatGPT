ChatGPT doesn't have internet access live, apart from the bing implementation which probably falls in the same fallacy. It will try to cite things when asked, but the only way it can do that is to make the citations up. Kind of make them look 'right' - like the kind of citation it would expect from maybe the correct website. The problem is that the source is made up with maybe the correct base url, or book name. The data doesn't have to exist, but chatgpt can tell that the site or book could potentially have some such data.
