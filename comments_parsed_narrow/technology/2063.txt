Unfortunately what seems to be happening now is that the students are increasingly using ChatGPT to cheat, and professors are either powerless to do anything, or are even actively encouraging them (have a couple personal anecdotes).

With the entire system being driven by standardized tests, which are heavily biased towards knowledge rather than skill, the ChatGPT is going to fuck things up royally before (and if) the educational system reacts.

The reason ChatGPT is acing professional tests now isn’t because it’s better than 90% of human applicants. It’s because most tests are checking the ability to recall information instead of the ability to apply it to cases that are not extremely straightforward. It’s like bringing a spellcheck computer to a Spelling Bee.
