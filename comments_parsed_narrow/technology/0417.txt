This so much. I spend so much time translating instructions and troubleshooting notes from my manager its insane. She's incredibly brilliant but we literally have to tell her to -h so we can understand what it is she found...

ChatGPT saved me probably an entire workday of translating her notes into workable KBs over the last 2 weeks.
