Thanks for discrediting yourself completely.

The ability to generate high-quality ouput via an LLM or any other generative AI, such as text to image generators like Dalle, using appropriate questions/requests is absolutely a highly valuable skill. 

The fact that you don't know that proves how little experience you have with using AI effectively in any professional capacity.

The very specific words you need to use craft high-quality output require a sophisticated understanding of subject matter in question in order to constantly be able to refine the AIs output to exactly what you're looking to create.

An example could be a very specific type of painting you want to generate which requires understanding of brushstroke techniques, canvas material, lighting simulation, perspective and a thousands other variables. An AI-assisted expert will be able to quickly  generate a high-quality image with specificity, whereas a novice who knows little to nothing of these variables will generate a lot of middling garbage.

Another example might be a civil suit complaint that requires understanding of certain novel damages theories that might not yet be broadly accepted in that jurisdiction and need to be tailored to meet the specific facts.
An AI-assisted lawyer will be able to quickly generate a good draft which can be edited on the fly where necessary, whereas a novice will create an unusable mess which will probably require a full redrafting from scratch.

The skill of prompting generative AI in most fields is already invaluable and is saving experts and professionals vast amounts of time. 
So yes, writing a good question/request into a generative AI like chatGPT is absolutely a valuable skill that many people don't possess.

I really pity you as you've already been left behind, but you just haven't realized it yet. I hope you wake up soon, for your own sake.
