I’d rather people just write decent books.

It’d be pretty easy to tell if a book was faked with ChatGPT, because no AI is going to be able to put together a coherent 600 page book without extensive human editing, which these “writers” aren’t doing. I’d be out whatever I’d have paid for it, and then I’d be right back where I’ve been before ChatGPT existed: sifting through an ocean of yet more low-quality books for anything even remotely worth reading.
