Headline, clickbait, misses the the point. From the article:

“That students instinctively employ high technology to avoid learning is “a sign that the educational system is failing.” If it “has no appeal to students, doesn’t interest them, doesn’t challenge them, doesn’t make them want to learn, they’ll find ways out,” just as he himself did when he borrowed a friend’s notes to pass a dull college chemistry class without attending it back in 1945.”

ChatGPT isn’t the fucking problem. A broken ass education system is the problem and Chomsky is correct. The education system is super fucking broken.
