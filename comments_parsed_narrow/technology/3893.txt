There is a difference between using the technology and letting it do your work for you and not understanding what it is feeding you. In my profession I have tested ChatGPT a lot and found that while it can and does help, if you aren't actually good at what you do it will give you the wrong answers and you'll never catch them.

It is important not to blindly trust what Google 2.0 gives you, you need the skills to recognize incorrect or incomplete answers and fox them. And if all you've ever done is just trust something like ChatGPT to get things right, you're gonna fail hard.
