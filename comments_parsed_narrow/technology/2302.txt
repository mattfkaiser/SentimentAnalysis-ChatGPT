I used ChatGPT while working on a paper with a studie partner. While it is quite good, it does make wrong statements if you ask it about elaborate topics like the link between goods market, money market and labour market.
Same for deep cuts into engineering topics.

I see it more as a tool where you can quickly gain a overwiev about a specific topic or to summarize text. Everyone who just copies the text it generates and sells it as their own is foolish.
