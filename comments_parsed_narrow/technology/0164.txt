Please for the love of god understand this: chatgpt is a language /chat AI. It is not a general AI. Humans view language as so innate we conflate it with general intelligence. It is not. Chatgpt did what many ppl do when chatting - agree with the other personâ€™s assertion for the sake of civility. It did so in a way that made grammatical sense to a native english speaker. It did its job.
