AI can pass interview exercises because our interview exercises are shit.

My company does screening questions, code exercises, pre-recorded video interviews and they’re all useless in actually predicting how the face-to-face interviews will go. We’d have more success if we just said “we’ll interview a random 10% of applicants”. 

If ChatGPT accelerates the death of those techniques then it’ll save everyone a lot of time.
