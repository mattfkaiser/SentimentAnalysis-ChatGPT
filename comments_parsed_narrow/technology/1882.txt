I've noticed that ChatGPT seems to do extraordinarily well whenever I ask it to build me a bash script in Linux. PHP, C++ and SQL it also does reasonably well. With Google Sheets and Excel though, it struggles a LOT and it keeps making calls to functions that simply don't exist. Maybe it has learned that most people who work with spreadsheets would rather just use scripts and functions than to deal with obtuse cell formulas? If so then why doesn't it just give me a script then instead of hallucinating imaginary magical functions that don't exist?

I don't blame it though: sometimes it takes me 2 whole afternoons and a whole LOT of recreational substances before I am can create the complex AF formulas that I'm looking for. ChatGPT is fun, but it actually takes me longer to debug the wacky output it yeets at me than to just derrive the formulas myself with pencil and paper.
