I’m no expert, but ChatGPT has been called a “bullshit generator.”

You ask kids to write bullshit, you get stuff generated by a bullshit generator.

The professionals that I’ve spoken to that are most disturbed by the potential of AI/Large Language model/etc. coming into mainstream use are part of industries that generate quite a bit of BS as a matter of course (copywriters, psychiatrists, business consultants).
