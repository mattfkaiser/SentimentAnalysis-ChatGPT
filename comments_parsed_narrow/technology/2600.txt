Buzzfeed just fired most of its writers (something like 80 people).  They are going to let AI generate most of their content.

What I will find interesting is, currently, an AI *cannot* produce copyrighted material so, in theory, anyone can take such content and use it all for free on their own website.

*Note: I am not a lawyer but the lawyer on the YouTube channel LegalEagle has mentioned that AI content cannot be copyrighted.
