A couple of months ago, I was writing a brief and decided to see what ChatGPT could do (just for fun).  It correctly identified the elements of the cause of action I was looking for.  I then asked if it could provide citations with parentheticals (short statements of the principle for which a case is cited), and it did.  How nice!  HOWEVER, because I have 30+ years experience as a lawyer, the next thing I did was to check the case cites on Lexis (an on-line searchable legal database of all published cases in the US).  Much to my amusement, half of the case citations were wrong, i.e. the cases had nothing to do with the topic, and the other half didn't exist at all.

What this moron did was just as bad as doing a Google search for case law and relying on anonymous websites for the results.  NO responsible attorney would ever do such a thing.  Moreover, once you find caselaw, you Shepardize it, meaning you do additional research to determine that the case is still good law, hasn't been overruled, criticized, ignored by other courts, etc.  If this idiot had done that, he would have found out immediately that his case cites were wrong.  I agree with the Judge.  The sanctions hearing is just the beginning of what can and should happen to him.  Remember, he did this on behalf of a paying client.  The State Bar should, at minimum, censure him and, preferably, suspend his license to practice until he takes some mandatory courses on legal writing and research as well as attorney ethics.
