I'm not surprised but not sure why just ChatGPT...there are new startups that are specific for CEOs, founders and team leads that aren't just a generic assistant.   


Tabi is an example (DTC founders & team leads). It helps them save time. You can ask anything related to sales, marketing, metrics, company financials/accounting, etc.
