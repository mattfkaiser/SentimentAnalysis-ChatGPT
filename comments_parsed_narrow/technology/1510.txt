ChatGPT doesn’t matter at all to anyone studying math, physics, engineering, or any other hard science.

This whole thing only affects the soft sciences and arts, and then, only at an undergraduate level. And if ChatGPT and similar are such a threat to these fields *past* the undergraduate, it’s worth questioning what the “academia-ization” of these fields is actually doing to improve them.

Are we getting better art/literature by turning these fields into academia and having large swaths of people pay tens of thousands to get a degree in them? Or is it just a way to enforce hierarchy/generational wealth with little bearing on the quality of real world things in these fields?

Perhaps this is a sign that we need to change our mindset around arts and undergraduate-level psychology, sociology, etc. Perhaps these things should be owned and understood by *everyone*, with fair expectations around that on all of us, not controlled by academia. The same way we treat things like home and car maintenance.
