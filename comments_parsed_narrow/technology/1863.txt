It's good at a lot of things, but I don't know where you're getting the "writes code better than any human". At the moment ChatGPT consistently fails to solve relatively trivial programming problems ([link](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/113910)). I fared better as an elementary schooler. While I've heard it works great for boilerplate, documentation, and general "code monkey" work, it has weak reasoning and problem-solving skills.
