>but giving the people who run the servers for ChatGPT the ability to inject their own morals and political beliefs is a very real concern for people. 

Why are people concerned? It’s a chat bot. It can’t vote, it can’t go on television. If you don’t like what it’s saying don’t use it. 

It’s also owned by private interests. It isn’t government funded or anything so why should the public have any say in what those owners do with it or have it say? I don’t particularly like Elon musk or how he’s running his companies but am not so conceited as to think I have any right to tell him what he should be doing. 

Even if chatGPT was a racist horrible boy vomiting hate I really wouldn’t have “very real concerns” I just wouldn’t use the thing. 

This is just typical nonsensical moral panic that conservatives cycle through every few years. Harkening all the way back to the satanic panic of the 80s. I can list the last couple, CRT, then it was drag queens, now it’s AI! Oooo scary!
