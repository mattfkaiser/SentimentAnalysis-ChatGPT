if you’re tired of hearing about ChatGPT, you’re not alone. It’s everywhere these days! Personally, I think it’s overhyped. I mean, sure, it’s cool and all, but it’s not like it’s going to change the world or anything. And if you’re not into artificial intelligence or language models, you’re probably just bored by all the talk.

So, if you’re going to talk about ChatGPT with someone, make sure you’ve got something interesting to say. Don’t just repeat the same old stuff over and over again. And remember that not everyone is as into it as you are.
