My operations management teacher explicitly told us to use ChatGPT to do homework and exams. He even went so far as to show us how to do it during class time. His demonstration produced the wrong answers and he told us that we would have to do it by hand as well so we could tell the software if it was right or wrong to help it learn. 

I refused to use it for 2 reasons. 1) If I have to do the math by hand anyway, I might as well just do it by hand. And 2) What is the point of learning how to do the material if I am just going to say "Hello computer, please solve this problem for me." 

I can only see AI being used like this further contributing to anti intellectualism since "Why learn it if the AI will just do it for me?"
