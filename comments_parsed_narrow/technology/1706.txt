ChatGPT:TLDR -  Apple has shown interest in new software utilizing generative artificial intelligence (AI) on its App Store. When an app developer called Blix attempted to update its email app with a ChatGPT feature, Apple initially blocked the update due to concerns about potentially inappropriate content for children. Apple's review team requested that the app's age restriction be raised to 17 and older or that content filtering be implemented. After Blix confirmed the presence of content filtering, the app was approved. Recently, OpenAI announced the release of a ChatGPT app for iPhone and iPad. While Apple was an early player in consumer AI with Siri, it has lagged behind competitors like Amazon's Alexa in subsequent years.
