ever since chatgpt was released it really made me hate reddit and the internet. People take all “information” at face value, make shit up from their own opinions and spew it as fact, and gobble up other people’s shit. It’s insane. 

ChatGPT talks nice but using it extensively for programming advice it’s made so many mistakes that I’d rather search for good answers on stack overflow.
