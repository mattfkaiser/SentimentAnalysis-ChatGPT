This lawsuit is a ploy by lawyers to show they are still needed so they can justify their high fees.  Think about it, if ChatGPT can pass the bar, why use lawyers at all?  Lawyers have the motivation to make ChatGPT fail and are using this lawsuit as a way to discredit ChatGPT and save their own necks. Isn't that obvious to everyone?

Regardless, even if they are right, it will only get better and better until it is flawless and like other professions certainly low level lawsuits would no longer require expensive legal advice.
