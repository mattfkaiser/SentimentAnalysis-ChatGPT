Bullshit. 

The goal of having people write essays is to have them regurgitate the information they learned in a concise and logical way. It reinforces their knowledge, critical and problem solving skills, logical reasoning. It’s the same reason why children need to learn multiplication even though there are calculators.

Using ChatGPT isn’t any different from hiring someone to write an essay for you. It’s cheating yourself of the skills that you would learn if you did it yourself.

Would you go to a doctor who used ChatGPT to get through med school ?
