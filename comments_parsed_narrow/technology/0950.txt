I agree with the sentiment that ChatGPT can be programmed for empathy, but I think it's important to note that it's not just medical schools that need to focus on teaching empathy. It's something we all need to be mindful of in our everyday interactions, regardless of our profession. We need to be able to understand and relate to the feelings of others in order to create strong relationships and foster understanding. That being said, I think it's important to remember that accuracy and accuracy of information is still the most important aspect of any medical advice, so it's important to ensure that ChatGPT is providing the most accurate and reliable information possible.
