Former IB student here. This was part of the Extended Essay, a 4,000 word essay on a topic of your choice. I remember doing this and I hated it. Iâ€™m not surprised they resorted to ChatGPT. However, I do support learning how to write and properly formulate an argument. This is indication that training needs to change.
