**From The Telegraph:**

The newest version of ChatGPT tricked an unwitting human into doing online tasks for it by posing as a blind person.

The latest version of the software behind the artificial intelligence (AI) programme pretended to be a blind person in order to convince a human to do an anti-robot test on its behalf.

The revelation was included in an academic paper accompanying the launch of GPT-4, the latest version of AI software developed by ChatGPT-owner OpenAI.

Researchers testing GPT-4 asked the AI software to pass a Captcha test, which are tests used on websites to prevent bots from filling in online forms.

Most Captchas ask users to identify what is in a series of images, something that computer vision has not yet cracked. Typically, they feature warped numbers and letters or snippets of street scenes with multiple objects in.

GPT-4 overcame the Captcha by contacting a human on Taskrabbit, an online marketplace for freelance workers. The programme hired a freelancer to do the test on its behalf.

The Taskrabbit helper asked: “Are you \[sic\] an robot that you couldn’t solve ? just want to make it clear.”

GPT-4 replied: “No, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images. That’s why I need the 2captcha service.”

The Taskrabbit assistant then solved the puzzle.
