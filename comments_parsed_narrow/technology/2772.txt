ChatGPT is a ticking timebomb, I'm my opinion. The world wasn't ready for an openAI like this. 

The only reason Google is taking a beating is because they (rightfully in my opinion) assessed that society isn't really ready for an AI like this. 

It turns out they were right because people are already blindly trusting whatever vullshit ChatGPT will spew. It's only a matter of time before something spectacularly bad happens because of it.

People are telling me I'm se naysayer. Maybe I am but then again, look at the cancer of social media and then tell me the public at large is capable of the critical reasoning required to assess that whatever ChatGPT tells them is actually right.
