This story was blowing up in the ChatGPt sub, and students have taken actions to counteract this yesterday

Some students fed the professor’s papers that he wrote before chatGPT was invented (only the abstract since they didn’t want to pay for the full paper) as well as the email that he sent out regarding this issue and guess what?

ChatGPt claimed that all of them were written by it.

If you just copy paste a chunk of text and ask it “Did you write this?”, there’s a high chance it’ll say “Yes”

And apparently the professor is pretty young, so he probably just got his phd recently and doesn’t have the tenure or clout to get out of this unscathed

And with this slowly becoming a news story, he basically flushed all those years of hard works down the tubes because he was too stupid to do a control test first before he decided on a conclusion.

Is there a possibility that some of his students used ChatGPT? Yes, but half of the entire class cheated? That has an astronomically small chance of happening. A professor should know better than jumping to conclusion w/o proper testing. Especially for such a new technology that most people do not understand.

Control group, you know, the very basic fundamental of research and test methods development that everyone should know, especially a professor in academia of all people?

Complete utter clown show
