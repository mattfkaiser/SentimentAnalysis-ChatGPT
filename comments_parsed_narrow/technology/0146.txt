If I taught English I would make an assignment where they include 3 or 4 different prompts and responses from chatgpt and then ask them to write their own that is inspired by it or something. The idea being that they see it's limitations and the power of their own mind being in their own control.

It's like the moving sidewalk at the airport. Sure, it takes you from here to there and if that's all you care about that's great. But I'd never trade my legs for the sidewalk. Being able to walk where I want, stop when I want, etc. 
That's the beauty of controlling my own legs. 

It's a similar thing for writing. Especially because writing is not as much about producing a paper as it is about formulating your thoughts. Chatgpt might be able to write a paper, but it can't express my thoughts because it's not able to see inside my brain.

That's why I love writing. That's what I would teach. Use chatgpt to teach kids how much more powerful they can be when they express themselves clearly.

But to do that you have to go past rote meaningless papers on the same old bullshit. And too many classrooms can't handle that. Especially with teaching to the test.

TTT and AI is a perfect combination to show how meaningless everything is.

Here, write an essay about Hamlet and be sure to include these 5 things that the state says you have to include, but also do it in your own words, even though there have been billions of essays about Hamlet featuring those same 5 things written in the past 10 years.

Oh, and don't you dare ask ChatGPT to generate this pathetically generic formulaic boiler plate essay that regurgitates the same required 5 bullet points as every one else. No. It's very important that you write your own unique essay that has exactly these 5 bullet points.

God. No wonder teachers are afraid do GPT. The way they have been forced to teach is complete bullshit and this tool just rendered that obvious beyond the point of denial.
