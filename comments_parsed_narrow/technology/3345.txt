Idk you would think an address to the public about the death of students and staff would be heartfelt, speaking  to let everyone know we are all in this together and we can mourn and feel safe in peace. Using an ai just feels heartless. It's not using an ai to draft a business email to your boss or a client to speed up time as part of formality lol. 

There is a time and place for chatgpt and I don't think this is one of them personally.
