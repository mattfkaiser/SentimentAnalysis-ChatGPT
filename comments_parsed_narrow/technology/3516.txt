So... I am 30 & in college, and before ChatGPT I was using another AI used for writers called "Jasper AI".

It's pretty similar but more skillful at writing imo. It costs money tho after a free trial.

The thing is I learned about it from YouTube professors recommending it. Phd's already use AI to write research papers, the highest level of academia. It is not cheating. So blanket calling highschooler admission of using an AI is pretty meaningless imo. Could it be abused and copy/pasted nonsense? Absolutely. That's inappropriate and disruptive towards their education. However pretty much all media is using AI in some way. Blogs, recipe websites, Zillow listings, Airbnb descriptions, research papers, news articles, YouTube scripts... These authors are already using AI and have been for a while. This is how we have SO many recipe blogs and "top 10" lists, because human authors can generate them very quickly with AI software AND write them to take advantage of Google's algorithm and get them on the 1st page asap. A large amount of our media consumption is already through AI. It is not "cheating" for a new York times writer to use AI as an assistant, nor for a professior to use it in publishing a paper. These kids are going to grow up needing to know how to use AI as an essential function of their job, especially if they professionally write. This is MUCH more complicated than "it's cheating" to use AI. That is an almost nonsensical argument. It *can* be used to cheat or be lazy I suppose, but it's a stretch to suggest the use of AI is cheating when it has already permitted our world of writing so deeply --all while in it's adolescence.
