Hilariously and ironically there was a post on an AI art subreddit where they compared Davincis Mona Lisa to some generated portrait that looks similar. Smuggly saying "look there's no difference". Completely ignoring the fact that literally the *only* reason the ai generated portrait looked so good and similar is precisely because Davinci made that painting (which then more people copied over time) feeding the ai.

It's similar with chatgpt. Sure, it can be useful for some things. But it's dumb AI, not AGI. I'm seeing tonnes of posts saying "the information this ai was fed included homophobic and racist data"... Errr yeah, it's feeding off stuff we give it. It's not AGI, it's not creating anything from scratch with creativity like we do.

It only shows how dumb our current education system is that blind ai fed with preexisting knowledge can pass tests. The majority of ours education is just forcing students to remember and regurgitate meaningless knowledge to achieve some arbitrary grade. That's exactly what ai is good for so that's exactly why they're passing exams.
