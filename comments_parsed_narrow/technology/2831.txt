I think this is just an overblown story, after someone picked up that a student tried to make a model to combat chatGPT, after ChatGPT made big news.  I do not believe his model can perfectly detect chatgpt output as chatgpt output. But it's good headlines people latch onto. I bet it would think a lot of human written stuff was made by chatgpt as well.
