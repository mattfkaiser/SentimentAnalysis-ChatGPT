> ChatGPT is an academic force multiplier. Not only that, it will also be a great equalizer for those with particular deficiencies. It won't just make things easier for everyone, it will also broaden the depth of our collective mind.

It will do nothing of the kind.  This isn't like the printing press replacing scribes, where the real purpose was to produce a book and the press created them more efficiently, albeit at the cost of the scribes' employment.  A student 'producing' a five-paragraph essay about the themes in Merchant of Venice is of no value in itself; it's desirable only insofar as the *process of creating it* causes/requires the student to reflect and learn.  Putting such pseudo-academic works 'on tap' zeroes out the learning to no actual benefit.
