Making things up is a buzzword we like to tell us because we like to feel special. The myth of the human intelligence. People don't make things up and pull it from thin air. There is always a string of thoughts to follow or it becomes yibberish. Kxiystukfhkxxjxkmxb that is made up because I didn't care what button I pressed, as soon as I cared it would become a product of preexisting information. In that sense we are all input-output function, let's call it a logic, complex ones but not really different.

You want to have Chat GPT ponder? Feed his responses to himself. Pondering is essential a feedback loop. 
In context of philosophy and God and proof of God there is saying, if God exists and he/she/it things it must be logical, because logic exists. In that sense he can't be all mighty, all knowing etc. Anyway, that example highlights the importance of logic, and ChatGPT is rudimentarily capable to put things into a logical relationship that mimics our ability to so. I don't thing the idea of a sentient machine is far fetched at that point. We are closer to it than ever. It is just a matter of wiring and stringing the correct logic together. Is that mimicking our intelligence? Sure, but as I see it, we are mimicking and reacting to each other from the day we are born to the day we die.
