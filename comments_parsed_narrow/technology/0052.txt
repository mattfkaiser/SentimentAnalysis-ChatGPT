Can confirm. I’m a lawyer and tried to use chatGPT to find a citation in a 900 page document. It cited to a made up section. Literally didn’t exist. It even had a “quote” that was NOT in there. 

On a separate occasion (giving it another shot) it cited to a regulation that didn’t exist. 

It was VERY CONVINCING because it used all the right buzz words to seem correct. 

But as a lawyer you HAVE to verify information you find. I haven’t used it again. Maybe one day it will become useful for the legal profession, but not right now.
