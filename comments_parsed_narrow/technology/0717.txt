Does it understand English? There is a very good video from Kyle Hill on YT about this fact. 

As a tldr alpha go beat the world go champ a few years back. This guy was the Bobby fisher or Gary kasperove of Go. Anything less then winning a tournament is a disappointing showing. He was absolutely dominate at Go. And he lost to alpha go 4-1. 

When chatgpt was blowing up there was a minor news article of a amertur beating the same bot that beat the champ at go Consistently. He used a unique trick that would never work in a game against humans because in go, we understand what groups of stones are, the bot did not and lost because of it.

It is a fantastic video I would recommend u watch it. I am woefully under representing what the video explains.
