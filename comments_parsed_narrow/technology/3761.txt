Surface has been great. It’s just been pretty safe with the latest yearly refreshes. 

Windows 11 is also a hot mess albeit serviceable. 

Xbox / games division is on fire (the good kind). 

Bing might become a thing with chatgpt integration. I’ve been using it more and more over google lately. 

Chromium edge has been my browser of choice for a while now.
