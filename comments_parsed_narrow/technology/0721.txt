ChatGPT4 is pretty damn scary at how often it’s right.

We put a bunch of interview questions in and it pretty much nailed them all.

Of course when it does a screw up, it is VERY confidently incorrect.

It’s not going to replace most workers - it just makes them much more efficient by automatic the tedious tasks.  Which is great for many white collar jobs where the goal is just to get things done fast.

The problem is going to be in schools - where the goal is to LEARN.  If you know how to solve a problem you can let it do it faster then check its work, and it’s a net gain.  If you never learned how to solve the problem you can’t really check it’s work, and it will take a lot longer trying to figure out where it might have fucked up.
