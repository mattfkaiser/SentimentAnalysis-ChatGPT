Ive been saying this for years at this point. Congress is too old and out of touch to do it. People always try to muddy the waters on this stuff and nothing gets done. Later we wish we had done some regulating AI up front. 

Some monopolies will happen regardless of the regulation or lack of regulation. Iâ€™d be regulating the uses of AI (like not using it for court decisions, etc) and how much data they are allowed to collect and force ChatGPT to pay people cash money for their data (Yes that will extend to the rest of the internet).
