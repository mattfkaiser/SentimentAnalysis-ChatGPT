I foresee that there will a progressive change on the type of questions on the discussion boards. ChatGPT will be capable of performing the most common and trivial tasks; this does reduce or eliminate those type of questions. The support forums will then be filled mainly by those more niche questions that ChatGPT can't (yet) solve. This process continues...

In any case, I still see a large need for human programmers; there are too many shoddily documented and supported libraries.
