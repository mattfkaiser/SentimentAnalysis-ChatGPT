I’m a lawyer.  I have had “discussions” with chatgpt.  It’s weird, it can kind of do legal reasoning if provided cases and statutes that is actually helpful in formulating new legal arguments BUT it absolutely cites non-existent cases.  

It is quite convincing when it does it too.  The format is all good etc… when you run it through google scholar it can’t find it.  You tell gpt it is wrong it says something like sorry, here is the correct cite, and that’s a fake one too.  

Being a lawyer who writes lots of briefs, it gave me hope for my job for another 6 to 12 months.
