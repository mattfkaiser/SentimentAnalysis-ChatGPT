I 100% agree that asking chatdgp to write your essay for you is cheating,  but at the same time - if chatgdp can write essays for you what value is that essay writing class providing?   How to write an argumentative essay?   Great,  but since you can get an essay in 30 seconds youll have to actually teach differently because those essays are a solved problem.  Teach students how to research,  how to form an argument etc.   

Maybe instead of writing papers ask students to review other papers and provide feedback.   Grade on students knowledge of what effective feedback is and if they understand what makes or doesnt make good papers. 

A calculator in math class can solve problems so teachers had to ask students to show their work.    Teachers are going to have to teach writing in a way that shows their knowledge instead of relying on the paper itself.   Which being completely honest im insanely biased because my writing teachers never bothered to read any of my work beyond a 1 minute glance over a mandatory 5 page paper.   If you were a model student who handed in a paper it got an A,if you were a B student it got a B.   The bare minimum effort was given.

When you have 30 students turning in papers your not going to get a good review.   Hell colleges rely on AI to review essay because grading essays is time consuming.   Writing classes were always broken,  this just makes the need to change more transparent.

Teaching writing is just going to have to adopt to stop relying on papers.

I just saw this in an article that kind of makes my point.

Sam Altman, the CEO of the firm behind ChatGPT, would agree, as he previously said that "generative text is something we all need to adapt to."

"We adapted to calculators and changed what we tested for in math class, I imagine," Altman said during an interview with StrictlyVC in January. "This is a more extreme version of that, no doubt, but also the benefits of it are more extreme, as well."
