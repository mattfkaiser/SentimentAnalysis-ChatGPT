I work in a middle school and I haven't seen it go big in that setting yet. I find that middle school kids are a little clueless and just learning how to use the internet with some level of purpose and intentionality. And a lot of them likely don't have the patience and skill to interact with ChatGPT in a way that would actually produce what they wanted.

High school though I could see it being a growing issue already.
