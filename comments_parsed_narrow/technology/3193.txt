Humans are being fooled by bots every day. There are bots fooling people right now on dating apps. If redditors are to be believed, this website is also filled from top to bottom with bots promoting political propaganda which convinces entire groups of people to follow along.

The above bots are far more primitive than the language models behind ChatGPT. It seems entirely expected that ChatGPT could fool people. To be frank, I don't think most people are that difficult to fool anyway.

ChatGPT by itself is an incredible technology and, even without this article, I would say it's an amazing display of AI's capabilities.

Like in one showcase, ChatGPT was shown a humorous photo. Not only was it capable of detecting what was in the photo exactly, but it also explained correctly why the photo would be humorous to a person. Now **THAT** is mind-blowing to me. The idea that AI can assess photographs and explain its meaning to humans shows an incredible ability.
