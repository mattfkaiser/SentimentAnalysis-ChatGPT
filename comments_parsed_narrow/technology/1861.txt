Yeah... I heard that hundreds of times before ( think first was in 1997 when Kasparov lost to Deep Blue) ... Large Language Models like ChatGPT are with us from 1966, just because they were made publicly available does not mean we are all doomed, but I am not going to explain as I guess you have never even used any of AI tools, you would understand its just a tool (still pretty poor imho at the moment anyways despite what you learn on youtube)
