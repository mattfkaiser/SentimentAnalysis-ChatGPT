I think the concerns about cheating are fair but I wholeheartedly agree that a blanket ban is absolutely wrong. This is a perfect example to use for teaching children how to think critically and evaluate. I would be having kids read different essays and determine which they believe are chatgpt and which were written by people. 

The point is these kids will likely have to grow up with tools like this available and a part of their lives when they're adults. We are doing them a disservice by not embracing the opportunity to explore a potentially powerful tool.
