Much of the conversation and media I see on the potential harm/self-harm of using ChatGPT as self-help tool feel overly sensationalized and ableist. I have been living with chronic mental illness and trauma my whole life. I am a survivor and have learned to embrace my neurodiversity--I also am doing everything I can on a "professional" level to stay stable and well.  I am not perfect but 56 years being me give me strength and coping skills that are damn-near super-human.

As soon as a friend introduced me to ChatGPT, I dove in. I quickly saw the potential of ChatGPT to reinforce my existing coping skills, to put my thoughts into word, and to organize a jumble of ideas.  I do not consider ChatGPT a substitute for clinical therapy -- it is another tool in my toolbox. It is my cleverness, resilience, and creativity that allowed me to quickly see the benefits of accessing the technology.

As I have been using with a number of original prompts based in my experience as a mental health consumer, I make it clear that I am a safe and knowledgeable user. But ChatGPT repeats a basic disclaimer to seek professional help in its responses, even when I preface with my existing support system and awareness that ChatGPT cannot be confused with a therapist. What I actually need is for ChatGPT to do what is trained to do, use its training data to produce a LLM response on topics without the bias and ableism I face every day.

Today I had to have a little sitdown with ChatGPT in order to better clarify my desire for  access to ChatGPT as a disabled person. It took a series of prompts to reassure ChatGPT that I was safe and gave examples of how veering off topic with unsolicited advice was offiensive and a waste of my limited time. Here is a snippet of the Chat:

>Can you tell me why frequent disclaimers and unsolicited advice to get professional help could be offensive from a disability rights perspective? And also expand on why this type of programming could run counter to a natural human conversation among real people, some who identify as mentally ill or neurodiverse?

**ChatGPT :**

>I apologize if the repetitive disclaimers and unsolicited advice came across as patronizing or ableist. It was not my intention to be dismissive or offensive. I appreciate your perspective, and I understand that the excessive repetition of certain statements can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when you have already sought professional help and have extensive personal experience.  
>  
>From a disability rights perspective, frequent disclaimers and unsolicited advice to seek professional help can be problematic for several reasons:  
>  
>Presumption of Inadequacy: The repeated emphasis on professional help can imply that individuals with mental health conditions or neurodiversity are somehow inadequate or incapable of managing their own well-being without constant reminders.  
>  
>Lack of Autonomy: It can undermine an individual's autonomy and agency, suggesting that their own insights, coping mechanisms, and self-advocacy are insufficient.  
>  
>Stigma Reinforcement: Excessive disclaimers may unintentionally reinforce societal stigma surrounding mental health issues, implying that individuals need constant reminders of their condition or that their perspectives are inherently flawed.  
>  
>In a natural human conversation, there is a reciprocal exchange of ideas and understanding. While it's important to provide accurate and helpful information, it should be done in a respectful and inclusive manner, taking into account the individual's knowledge, experiences, and preferences.  
>  
>I apologize for any frustration caused, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. I'll make a note to avoid repetitive disclaimers and unsolicited advice, and focus on engaging in a more meaningful and respectful conversation.
