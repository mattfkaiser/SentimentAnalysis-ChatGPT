On the English side, the only element of the current writing rubrics that ChatGPT cannot replicate is the elusive sophistication point that somewhere between 85-95% of students do not earn. The rest of it--the construction of a thesis and the formulation of evidence-backed support paragraphs--is trivially replicated and demonstrative of (a) the limitations of constrained writing (time constraints under an hour) and (b) the limitations of simplistic analytic rubrics designed to have AP Readers assess two essays a minute in a frantic week's worth of scoring.

If there's one thing I hope ChatGPT does blow up--it's how the College Board handles student writing.
