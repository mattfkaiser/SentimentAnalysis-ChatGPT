Fucking THIS. I'm waiting for people to realize what a game changer this is, but it's just not happening. Maybe once Google and Bing have it as a default for search people will start to use it and see how powerful it is. This is just an early beta version right now in 1, 2, 3 years it will be used a lot more for different things. Chatgpt is just a single model. Microsoft had already integrated search into it and soon we will have models + search on top of models and it will get really interesting.
