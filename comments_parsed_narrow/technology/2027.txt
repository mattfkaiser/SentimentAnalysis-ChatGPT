To start: this is the New York Post. 

Second: we [educators] did in-fact see this coming. 

Third: I'm myself am engaged with numerous people at the university I work at to discuss how to use this as a force for good in learning, and how to promote assignment design which minimizes the risk of ChatGPT3. And we are also exploring how a tool like it can be used to help the productivity of everyone. I am not going to be the only person having these conversations and I know I'm not. My peers at other universities are having the same discussions. 

How many students are going to know about ChatGPT3 vs buying a paper from a student, or by plagiarism of published works? Both are far, far more common. And while I'm still learning myself, it seems to me the methods to counteract ChatGPT3 are the same as the strategies for defeating other plagiarism. 

Design assignments which can't be plagiarized. Have assignments which require defense. Review assignments in stages. Adapt the development of the writing into an active learning experience. Chunk the assignment. These strategies doesn't address all scenarios but it goes a long way to defeating the need, particularly in undergrad courses, can make the assignments more manageable for the student and can help make the students better students.

EDIT: I can English gooder.
