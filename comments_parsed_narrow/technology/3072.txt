If they really must do it, change paper length requirements so that they can be written in an hour, have students collect their source material outside of class, then have them write their papers in class on university computers with chatgpt blocked during a class period instead of at home, like an exam. Honestly I think this would be better than having to find the time at home to write a ten page paper. Three pages or whatever in class and the teachers don't have to worry about plaguerism.
