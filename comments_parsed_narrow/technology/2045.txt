Exactly. Or just (hand)written essay exams, live, in the classroom. Or if it’s remote, going to a proctored exam center to sit for it, just like you have to do for state licensing exams. Pick a test center that’s local to you, schedule your exam, check in your bag and phone, show your ID, and take your exam at their computers without internet access. 

Or if proctored testing centers aren’t accessible, a live, on video written essay exam, that you take a picture of with your phone and submit on camera. As long as exam questions aren’t given prior, there seem to be a number of ways to conduct assessments in a format in which ChatGPT, and future iterations, are inaccessible to the student.
