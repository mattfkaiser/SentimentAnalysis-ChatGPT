I think you are missing my point. I want them to use Grammarly to learn how to write correctly, and they get free premium use.

ChatGPT is average writing at best, in my experience. Just like with buying papers, students could learn to write good papers with the time they spent cheating. I personally believe ChatGPT is cheating at the college level.
