When I was in high school, any essays that cited Wikipedia were not accepted, the student was failed. 
Less than 2 decades later and it is expected that Wiki would be cited.

Those who embrace and learn to use ChatGPT and competing systems will have an advantage, regardless of what the education systems are saying and doing.

Edit: To everyone downvoting, pretty sure it depends on the school as to whether Wiki can be cited. Regardless, the point regarding ChatGPT still stands. Downvoting this comment because the future bothers/upsets you wonâ€™t change the fact.
