right but they haven't launched anything like ChatGPT yet...not on search or assistant.

Google tend to be slow to start but Gmail, Android, Chrome and other market leading products show they soon catch up and overtake.

just because ChatGPT is the first doesn't mean it will be worth shit in 6 months or a year. I say watch this space.

EDIT (because I had another thought) We even know that Google have a ChatGPT like Narrow AI that is so life-like that one of the engineers thought it was sentient and tried to sue to free it.
