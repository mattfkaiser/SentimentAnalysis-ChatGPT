The issue with ChatGPT is that it has its own style. All you have to do is feed ChatGPT examples of your written work, and then ask it to write a new paper using the same voice and writing style, including the same spelling errors, grammatical errors, and punctuation errors as your example papers. The result is something new that is nearly indistinguishable from something that would have written.
