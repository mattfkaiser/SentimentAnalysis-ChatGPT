I asked it to give an example of a sound deductive argument once, just to test it out in basic philosophy knowledge. This was the response.

1. All animals have 4 legs.
2. All cats are an animal.
Conclusion: all cats have 4 legs.

If my philosophy teacher gave this to us, we would have been very confused students.

Because not all animals have 4 legs, violating premise 1. And any cat missing a leg or two would violate the conclusion.

This is proof to me that ChatGPT cannot replace teachers. At all. It might be a useful tutoring tool, it might even reduce the workload of teachers... but replace them it absolutely cannot do.

This isn't even including how *horrendously bad* it is at math.
