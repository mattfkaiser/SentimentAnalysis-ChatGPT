That's fair. I'd love to understand what it is about AI that makes you think about it any differently to any other computer based tool, like Google, or spell checker? Where do you personally draw the line and why?

For me, I'd just want the person to do the best thing they can: if someone has to write a heartfelt message - which is inevitably going to be challenging for anyone - I'd want them to use all the tools they have to get the best output they can, for the sake of all the recipients of that message. 

It's a tough time for everyone related to the deaths: making it harder for some people simply because they used a particular tool to try do a good job only adds to the misery in the world.
