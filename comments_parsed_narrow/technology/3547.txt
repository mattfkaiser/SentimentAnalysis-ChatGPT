The one thing I see is chatgpt doesn't do well with cultural nuance, if this is what I'm trying to say, meaning, this is a story about eating beans and having flatulence and the AI eventually eventually takes it to mean 'wind instrument.' Still interesting though what it's capable of.

I recently posed a question on it about things to know to grow cannibus in a tent, and it gave reasonable information and even talked about the legal ramifications in states that allow it like in VA. I wonder how far chatgpt can really go where serious applicants are concerned.
