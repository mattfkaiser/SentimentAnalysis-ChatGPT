College professor here. We're not all that scared of ChatGPT. The essays it writes sound fine *to an undergraduate student* but not really all that great to people who have spent decades thinking about topics.

Math professors were scared of the calculator, especially the big, graphing/programmable calculators and again when Wolfram Alpha came onto the scene. The solution there was to write different types of questions.

The same will be true of ChatGPT. Is it powerful? Yes. Will it help learning progress? Absolutely. But will it fundamentally threaten higher education and shake it to its core? Hardly.
