If I understand this correctly, a professor wrote up an assignment, submitted it to ChatGPT, then graded the result knowing that it was written by ChatGPT. So let me guess the possible (and possibly unconscious) thought process here:

- “I can’t give the analysis an A, that would be too dramatic and lack credibility.”

- “But I can’t give the analysis a C, because that wouldn’t be dramatic enough to create any buzz.”

- “So B/B-seems about right.”

Wake me when someone has: 

- submitted an identical assignment to several human students and several A.I. applications, 

- had them graded by several qualified academics who don’t know which is which, 

- then compared the A.I. grades to the human grades.
