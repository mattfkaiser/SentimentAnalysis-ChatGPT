Not op but I've been using chatgpt at work for a few weeks now with a coworker. I've been using it as a glorified translator. Want to convert security policies into a different format? Done, and we'll 90% of the time. The other 10% is trivial to debug and fix. 

Got some error with terrible formatting? If it doesn't help, which it usually does, it'll atleast make it more readable. 

Want some quick, condensed info on a new topic as a starting point? It's got your back. 

I've essentially stopped using Google at this point. The only time I use it is when I know what I'm searching for already. I spend much more time thinking about the problem instead of wasting time going through every document for new software. My coworker has it writing unit codes and documentation, I haven't developed that trust yet. 

It's been awesome. I already said to my sister I'd be willing to pay $100/m for it in the future once it becomes really good.
