I see an alarming trend of redditors calling headlines clickbait when it is not in any way. Clickbait used to mean a headline that teased the content of the article without giving any information, i.e. a classic clickbait format would be, "You won't believe what Noam Chomsky said about ChatGPT". Such a title tells you nothing.

Contrast with this title, which is the same on the websites, and includes actual quotes from the subject which sum up his thinking. The fact that there is more to the story is not evidence of anything. There's *always* more to the story, otherwise what's the fucking point of writing an article?

Do you expect to get the entire summation of something from a 10 word headline? Is that the kind of intellectual laziness we've come to? I get most people don't bother to read the articles, but this is another level
