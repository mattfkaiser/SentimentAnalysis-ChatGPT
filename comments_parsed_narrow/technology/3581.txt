People who’ve never cared to write can easily churn out low quality books and flood Amazon in the hope of making quick bucks. 

Flooding an area like Kindle Unlimited where many self-aspiring authors put a lot of effort in to their work would just end up hiding good works. Yes I know there are some low effort books there but there’s a lot of good ones too. I’ve read many of them. 

Now imagine every opportunist used ChatGPT to flood it with a bunch of poor books to try to make quick bucks. It will start to hide the hood ones.
