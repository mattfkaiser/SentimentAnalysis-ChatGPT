But it’s not a controversial statement to say that there are good fund managers. Like sure your average fund manager is utilizing tactics that everyone else is and thus any decision they are making is mostly baked into the price fluctuations. But a good fund manager that is utilizing a superior understanding of the markets and their understanding of the massive data dumps that corporations release every quarter absolutely will be able to outperform the SP 500. Well at least I’m not convinced that it’s 100% luck and that there absolutely are people out there that are beating the SP 500 on something more than luck and borderline legal insider knowledge.

What CharGPT offers isn’t just “hey pick some stocks for me”, but rather its API can be used to summarize all the quarterly data dumps and analyze Twitter to capture market movement at a faster pace than anyone else. Before this is all baked into the price, there is a period of about 5 years where there is some real opportunity to make a lot of money using ChatGPT and other language models.
