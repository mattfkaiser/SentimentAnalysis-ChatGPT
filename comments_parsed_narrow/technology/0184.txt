>If you try to sell a Midjourney image or a film which script has been done by Chat GPT then you are breaking copyright law. 

Only if you have not done anything further with the generated work. If you have altered it in some way that it satisfies the Human Authorship Requirement. Then you can most definitely have it copyrighted. There is a graphic novel which the images involved were AI generated. However since they were arranged by a human along with text to create the final graphic novel. That graphic novel was able to be copyrighted even though it uses AI generated images.

[The US copyright office has already released an extensive statement of policy regarding this.](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence) Of course this only holds true for the US. But it is likely that other countries will have a similar ruling on the matter.
