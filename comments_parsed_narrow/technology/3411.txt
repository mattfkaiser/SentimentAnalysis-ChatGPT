So, I actually use ChatGPT every single day I go to work. I use it to write meeting summaries with action items, agendas, outlines of already written content and even emails. It saves me HOURS. Literally hours per day. I’d say an average of 3-4 hours per work day, so 15-20 hours a week. That’s a part-time job…

But do you know what happens when you use these tools and regain that productivity? Parkinson’s Law comes and smacks you in the face. “Work expands to fill the time allotted.” Which basically means that I get more done per day, so more is given to me to do, and I lose the edge I had before, and also expectations have been raised.

I don’t really see Open AI taking jobs, but as a helper, an accelerator, absolutely. There is a “myth” in the Automation community (where I work) that “any task, no matter how complex, can be automated if broken into small enough parts.” This has proven to be false on so many occasions because of the need for “judgement” at certain critical points in those tasks to achieve a desired outcome. With Open AI, some of those “judgements” can be made with relative accuracy. This however does not replace or really even reduce the need for human input, it just changes the places where those inputs occur. I think that the ultimate truth of AI assistance in business is that Parkinson’s Law will be the balancing force in all of this. Will some jobs be lost to Automation? Certainly. Will complex jobs be lost? Doubtful. The work will expand to fill the time allotted, and people on those jobs will be able to accomplish more in the same amount of time.
