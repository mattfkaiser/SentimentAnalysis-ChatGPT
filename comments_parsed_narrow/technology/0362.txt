It reminds me of how the Internet used to be: search for something and get straight answers. Now it's dodging a bunch of sponsored results, then digging through a blog post with a ton of filler and ads until I finally get what I'm looking for, only to realize I have to go through a paywall to get the rest.

Fuck all that noise. Chatgpt is amazing for its simplicity of use alone.
