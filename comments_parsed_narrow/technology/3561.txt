The thing about ChatGPT is that you need provide it with a decent prompt in order for it to generate something of quality and you need to be able to critically assess if what it's spewing out is any good. People who are not good writers will not be able to do either of those things very well, which is why ChatGPT is actually more of a useful tool for good writers; it can help them push through a block or minor difficulties in writing, but it's never going to produce The Next Big Thing for someone who can't really write in the first place.
