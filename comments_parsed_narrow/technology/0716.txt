does autism cause vaccines?

  
ChatGPT - "No, autism does not cause vaccines. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism. This claim was based on a study that has been thoroughly discredited and retracted from the scientific literature. Numerous studies since then have found no link between vaccines and autism."
