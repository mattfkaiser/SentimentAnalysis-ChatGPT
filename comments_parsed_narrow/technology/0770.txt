Bots have been able to play the games better then gamers since forever.  We don't need ChatGPT (or whatever the correct term for A.I. is- since it isn't true A.I.) to do this.

Take racing games as an example.

The last thing you want is bots that continuously run perfect turns on the track and optimal speeds.  The moment the player messes up they simply can't catch up.

Every racing game has some sort of 'rubber banding' built in.  You know how much fun it is to be racing head to head on the last lap?  THAT IS ENTIRELY INTENTIONAL.

FPS are the same way.  The last thing you want are bots with perfect aim.

A.I.'s and CHATGPT are the NFT's of this year.

I mean, it isn't entirely accurate.  The useage case for NFT's is pretty low.  CHATGPT and the underlying A.I. (godddamit it pains me to call it that) has a legitimate use.

But NFT's last year were crammed into everything because VIP's thought people wanted it.  That is going on here.
