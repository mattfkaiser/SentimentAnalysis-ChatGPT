I agree and at first that’s what I brushed it off as, or non-native speakers, but I legit saw 7-8 in like a 2 day period, with a couple being so bizarre it couldn’t have possibly been a joke/miscommunication. This was probably about a week after chatGPT hit the mainstream news and AI Seinfeld was popping off. I’m almost positive it was bots, I wish I had saved a couple to look back on.
