THANK YOU FOR SAYING THIS

I'm in medicine, but I have been thoroughly unimpressed by ChatGPT. At best, it should be called "smart computing", NOT artificial intelligence. 

All of the things you've mentioned? I have noticed the same thing too in my own writing. The level of depth is worthless. In terms of business email writing, cover letters, and the life, it's a dream. But one must ask themselves if these tasks were really ever more than annoying tasks that we would rather not write anyway. 

When people were trying to argue with me that it would replace me as a doctor, I laughed my ass off. Passing the Step 1/2 board exams for medical licensing is only cool until you realize the tests are a STANDARDIZED Format (meaning they don't change the types of clues or question types), and the test itself is actually 40 questions meant to be answered in one hour. And you do that 8 times. 

Do people really think it's impressive that a robot with text recognition, an Internet connection, and the capacity to read paragraphs and paragraphs without getting tired could pass the test? I don't. 

AI can't tell if you lie to them. They can't diagnose anything unless you INPUT the material, and even then, you're just listing out differentials, not solving the case. 

I disagree that it will be problematically good. In fact, I think we're going to find out that these AI engines all suffer from the same flaw - they are TOO perfect.  Look at how we've recently worked out a method to [catch cheating in FPS shooters (something thought to be impossible)](https://youtu.be/LkmIItTrQP4). I think we'll figure it out. 

But if you could, could you elaborate more on what bothers you about the discourse? You gave some really good insight and it would be cool to hear more
