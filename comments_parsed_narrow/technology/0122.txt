ChatGPT is a language model, it's main purpose is to sound natural. It has no concept of "facts" and any time it happens to say something true is purely coincidental, due to a correlation between statements that sound true and things that are true. Which is why anyone relying on it to tell them facts is incredibly misinformed. 

Never take what ChatGPT outputs to you as facts, it's only good for producing correct sounding English.
