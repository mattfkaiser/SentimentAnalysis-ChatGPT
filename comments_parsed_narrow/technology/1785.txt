i made hundreds of thousands writing essays (did it 4-5 years)

this prob would have put me out of a job lol

having used it myself tho, i’m certain professors that care can detect if if they purposefully change essay requires to actually be less formal and require more personal anecdotes. ChatGPT is incredibly complex and can even write in personalized styles but it’s not great at having 1 style and then having contrasting personal anecdotes because it requires too many inputs.

however, again as a former essay writer, vast majority of university professors don’t have the time or interest to demand such nuance and often have mandates from administrators not to waste that much time trying to catch plagiarism. a ton of plagiarism comes from high paying international students and at least in my experience numerous canadian universities purposefully make very little effort to catch it, especially as long as it’s elective courses.

i would imagine graduate programs are certainly going to give a shit and make efforts but likely not business electives like consumer behaviour.
