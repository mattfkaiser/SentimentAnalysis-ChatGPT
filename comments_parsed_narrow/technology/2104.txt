Some people is comparing IAs with calculators, and they have nothing in common.

IAs are for education what crossbows and fire weapons were for the military world in 1500s or what industrial machines were for traditional guilds in 1800s.

To allow higher education students use IAs is like allow primary students use calculators (a madness). And the problem here is that is impossible to stop Chat GPT or prevent students to access it.
