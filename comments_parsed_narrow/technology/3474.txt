As much as I understand the need to adapt to new technologies, I have to disagree with the notion that using ChatGPT to write essays is acceptable. It's one thing to use it as a reference or a tool to improve your writing, but it's another thing entirely to rely on it to write an entire essay.

Sure, the AI can provide you with templates and ideas, but it doesn't teach you critical thinking or the ability to articulate your own thoughts and ideas. Plus, what happens when the AI gets it wrong? How do you know if the information it's providing is accurate or not? It's important to learn how to do your own research and fact-checking, and relying solely on an AI to do it for you is a disservice to your own education.

I agree that schools should adapt to new technologies and teach students how to use them to their advantage, but we can't forget the fundamentals of writing and research. It's about finding a balance between utilizing new tools and techniques while still developing important skills that will benefit us in the long run.
