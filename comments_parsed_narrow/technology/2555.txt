It's too expensive to run ChatGPT at search engine scale.

And for it to even come close to Google Search's functionality they'd need to re-train it on new data at least weekly ($$$$$).

It's not possible (with the current state of LLMs and compute power) to scale chatGPT to a Google Search-like service.

ChatGPT would also need to add features to become a usable search tool.

We're still a long way off from LLM's competing with Google Search.
