I am having a lot of fun with ChatGPT but my take away is that its basically as reliable fact wise as Google or Wikipedia. It will get you the answer to many questions a lot quicker than the more classic web search methods but you still need to check its work.

Also the tone of ChatGPT is one of confidence and authority which makes when its wrong even more fun.
