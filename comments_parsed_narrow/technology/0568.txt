> What if you didn’t review each answer for validity?

Then you’re using the tool wrong.

Everybody keeps blaming ChatGPT for “wrong” answers. It’s not supposed to give “right” answers. It’s not a knowledge engine or encyclopedic database. People need to stop using it as one.

What’s correct differs from source to source anyway.  Who would even decide what’s correct and what’s not, and how would they do it?

ChatGPT works exceedingly well when you know what to use it for and how to do so.
