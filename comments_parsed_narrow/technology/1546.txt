I appreciate that sentiment

I learn best from example, and have found that online math calculators capable of showing described steps are the absolute best way for me to learn the process of multi-step problems in courses such as calculus, but I feel that many school administrators would ban these tools without a second thought upon learning about them.

Now that doesn't mean we should be allowed to use such tools in tests, there are plenty of math tests you can't and shouldn't take with a calculator in this day and age as well, not to mention there are plenty of other reasons to steer clear of ChatGPT

Imo for now it's a decent 3rd opinion, and it's refreshing that nobody tries to sell me Pepsi when I just want to know what | does in Java
