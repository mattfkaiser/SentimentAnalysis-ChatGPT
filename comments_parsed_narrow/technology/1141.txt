I'm convinced that most people don't yet realize that you can actually revise its output with additional prompts.

Almost every single time somebody criticizes its output, the only thing I can think is, *"umm, just tell that to ChatGPT, not to us. It will fix that for you if you let it know that's what you want..."*

It can't read minds. Its output is only as valuable as what you input. Keep inputting to get your desired results.

People act like if it doesn't read your mind and give you exactly what you want from a lazy ass generic prompt, therefore it's unable to provide such desired results. But, you just have to work with it and it'll do pretty much anything you want.
