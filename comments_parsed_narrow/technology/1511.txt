For real. Everyone who hates writing and reading seems to be super gung-ho about this being the future of education, bc it means they’ll no longer have to do critical thinking and reasoning when it comes to writing and defending an argument/essay. I’m so fucking tired of people acting like being taught writing/basic critical thinking is useless. 

Sure, what the world needs is MORE idiots who lack critical thinking skills and can’t differentiate between a valid argument and a logical fallacy. Comparing this ChatGPT to calculators is such a joke, bc with calculators you still have to put all the right numbers in and hit the right buttons. With an AI writing tool, you don’t have to do shit.
