"people are freaking out about,"  


forgive me if I detect a sense that...you believe this concern is...overblown?

I'm a content writer. Content teams are being gutted all across the entire industry, and employees are being told explicitly that the reason is they are being replaced with ChatGPT.

Like....I need you to understand that THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE are losing their jobs RIGHT NOW IN THE REALLY REAL WORLD because of this AI that you feel they shouldn't be "freaking out about." 

But that's still just my assumption behind the meaning of what you said, so correct me if I'm wrong.

Regardless, the point I want to make clear is that the second a lot of people are losing their jobs because of AI, it becomes a threat to the economy and is absolutely worth taking a bit more seriously.
