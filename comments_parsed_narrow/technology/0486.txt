first of all chatgpt filters out hate and self harm, might not be perfect but it does have filters in place to prevent it giving potently harmful information.

second of all, many people with autism disorders struggle with human conversations, having a robot they can talk to is pretty revolutionary, then there comes the issue with missing appointments because of depression, now someone can easily access the help. Finally, social stigma of many issues surronding such things like sexuality prevent people from receiving help.. hell, in some countries going to therapy alone could be stigmatised, now people can access help for their issues without these barriers.

And the final reason is that a computer has no morals, other than what is programmed I guess, you said it is good that a human has ethics and morals that may prevent a healthy relationship from fostering, I am meaning clients that have been incarcerated and have genuinely done bad things.

This is pretty revolutionary.
