That hilarious joke led me to contemplate senators using ChatGPT. Imagine them parsing bills and proposals in order to give the senator a bullet point list of takeaways. Something lawmakers currently use interns for. Ugh. You just know it will get used this way. And now AI biases can become the senator's biases! Excellent.
