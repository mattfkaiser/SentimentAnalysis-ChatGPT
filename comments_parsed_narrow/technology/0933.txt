The whole ChatGPT is infuriating to me as a software dev and someone that has worked in AI. 

No, it is not as amazing as everyone thinks. 

The viral marketing on social media for this has it spiraling out of control. 

It can only act as a very high level problem solver. Aka, at the current state it absolutely cannot replace all the traits of an actual human. 

And the only jobs in peril to be replaced by this tool are ones that likely should not exist anyway.
