I’m not worried about ChatGPT performing well. In fact, I’m more excited about the possibilities than the downside even as I know this tech will obliterate jobs (including formerly secure jobs in tech). 

My comment is about the purpose of mass education. The purpose is to mold us into workers. I’m saying of course ChatGPT and the like perform well on standardized tests. Standardized tests are just a way to measure and quantify human performance to later be used in the work force. Why shouldn’t machines replace us to do the jobs we are being molded to do? It makes perfect sense. 

Look at life before the industrial revolution. We didn’t have mass education and standardized tests because we didn’t need it. 

I have no idea what’s next… well, besides the struggle period of mass unemployment and competition for dwindling resources. But if you wanna go down that path.. eh, the earth clearly has too many people trying to live on it anyway. 🤷‍♀️
