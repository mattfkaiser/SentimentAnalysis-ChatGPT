This is just me spitballing but a lot of outsourced callcenter order takers/ low level tech support / appointment setters / reservation takers and customer service reps need to start thinking about brushing up on their skillset. If a callcenter can replace 75% of it's payroll with a monthly app subscription fee, they won't hesitate to fire them all.

Oh - that reminds me, outsourced **front line HR Admins working primarily via phone  - goodbyyyyyyyyyye**.

ChatGPT will handle all your firing processes , press one to hear about your COBRA options....

Note: my emphasis is on outsourced. Any company that appreciates the value of  experienced **in house people** and the superior service they provide will (probably) stay the course - if they can afford it.

[But most of the onshore / nearshore callcenters](https://www.outsourceaccelerator.com/guide/top-30-largest-call-centers-in-the-world/)who pay hourly wages of any size are going to be looking at this as a way to reduce costs, office space rent footprint, etc which is most of your expense. If they don't, they will be competing with offshore centers who will.

Running a contact center of 1,000 reps on the phone will drop to zero phone reps and maybe a dozen support/admin/managers.

You'll need a few experienced problem resolution folks to handle the high end complaints, a few tech folks to keep the hardware and servers running, and a department head + admin. You could scale this up to replace megacenters with thousands of reps.
