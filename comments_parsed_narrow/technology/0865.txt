ChatGPT is not learning the core ingredients and all possible seasonings in a chili. Chat GPT doesn't understand how ingredients interact or what effect they have on the recipe, it just identifies the way that words tend to combine in something labeled as a chili recipe. It's just processing language, it doesn't actually know what it is saying.
