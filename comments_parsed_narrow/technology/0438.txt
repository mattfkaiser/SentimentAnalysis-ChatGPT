Writing is like a muscle. The more you write, the stronger your writing gets. Setting content aside, if you want to learn how to write formally you need practice writing formally and this is the real benefit of humanities courses and college essays. Writing is super powerful in modern society, and the students who rely on ChatGPT are setting themselves up for failure in the future. In ten years, hell even in five, people will say 'this reads like it was written by a ChatAI.' If you want to make money off youre words, you have to write *better* than a Chat ai. That doesn't mean you have to write well, Jack Kerouac wrote *On the Road* while high on Meth. God only knows what Hunter Thompson was on when he wrote *Fear and Loathing*. But you do have to write in way that gives your words a human touch, something that an AI cant replicate. This is true even for engineers and STEM, unless you never plan to write your own grant proposal or budget justification in your career.
