Are you even listening to what you're saying? You are literally just suggesting reading sources of information, but instead of actual sources written by people who know what they're talking about you're hoping that a chatbot will tell you the right answer. Chatgpt isn't actually intelligent. It can't create any new information and it can't even be trusted to provide accurate copies of existing information. Plus the tendency it has to just agree with prompts and phrase wrong information in a right-sounding way means you can't trust anything it says unless you already know the answer. Why would you want to read a chat it's best attempt to summarize a bunch of news reports, studies and scholarly articles when you could just, you know, read those sources?

>If we are not teaching our kids how to do this, how to use these tools, then they will be doomed to second or third place against others who are learning how to use these new tools.

No, I think the kids you try to teach to just type their questions into ~~google~~ chatgpt and accept whatever the first answer is will just be unable to think for themselves and will have no sense of media literacy.
