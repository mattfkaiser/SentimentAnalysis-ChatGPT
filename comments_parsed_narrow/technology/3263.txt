They’re pretty vague on what “replaced” means.  Did these companies actually let go of employees and replace them with ChatGPT, or are they having their employees do more without hiring help by using ChatGPT?

My guess is the latter.

In either case however, ChatGPT sounds analogous to a layer of peanut butter to help you swallow a bitter pill.  Worth looking into how many of these companies are facing a cash-strapped uncertain future and are looking for ways to accomplish more with less money.
