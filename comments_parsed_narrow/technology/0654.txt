Yeah I’m puzzled this is like the CEO of a movie studio saying the same thing about writing movie scripts. He has absolutely no personal knowledge on it.

I’ve programmed professionally 20 years. I use ChatGPT to help me write better English, like a recommendation letter. I would use it in an instant if it could help me save even a minute in code. It has not!

Maybe someone who doesn’t know where to start in code can use it. Maybe me 20 years ago. It would be like a chef asking ChatGPT how to make a lasagna. Unless they just don’t know, they wouldn’t!
