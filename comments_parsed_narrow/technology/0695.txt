Just to be clear ChatGPT isn't connected to our ticketing system, we are manually feeling the tickets into Chat GPT. 

For our ticketing system we us Service Now's ITSM. 

If you are asking becuase you are looking for a ticketing solution, my favorite ticketing solution is either Zendesk or Freshdesk. Both are far cheaper and have a lot of great features.
