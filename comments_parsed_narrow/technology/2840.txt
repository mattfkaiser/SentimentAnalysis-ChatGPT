Here's a rewrite of my comment:

*I also have an interest in this topic. In my job, I use ChatGPT to slightly modify text while still maintaining its original meaning. This tool uses synonyms and correct grammar to make the writing more polished, but I have noticed that the detector I use can still detect that the text has been altered. I am unsure of the reason why this is considered important or if it could be considered plagiarism. To me, it seems like a tool that simply helps to improve the grammar of a piece of writing.*

I would edit this to make it sound more like me.
