I’m a doctor. This does not surprise me. Not because AI is so advanced, but because passing an exam and diagnosing a rare condition are incredibly simple to do. A moderately intelligent 10th grader with internet access can do this. All of the doctors, even the worst ones, were able to pass the exam. That is not a sign that you are a good doctor, it’s a sign that you have the absolute bare minimum of knowledge needed. The reason why many doctors miss rare diagnoses is that they have limited time, limited resources, biases, and incorrect information. I would love to see how ChatGPT does when the patient answers its questions incorrectly because they did not understand (or lied), the necessary tests are not available because insurance would not approve them (or patient has no insurance and this can’t get the tests), and when you disrupt its processing constantly (analogous to a hum a doctor being constantly interrupted). Maybe AI is the future of medicine, but we could do a lot better now if we did the things we know are needed for good outcomes rather than what is cheap, convenient, or profitable.
