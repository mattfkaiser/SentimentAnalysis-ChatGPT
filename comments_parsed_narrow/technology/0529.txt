I think of it more as a gullible relative that believes everything they read on the internet.  I have used it to help write code and plan a vacation.   And as long as you check its work, it is a great source of ideas.  You just have to know that it can't tell the difference between right/wrong/obsolete information.   It will occasionally assume a business is still open, assume the marketing copy on a website is factual, or assume that you have access to a certain software API.   It doesn't really know, but sounds pretty confident, and that's what confuses people.   

When hoax emails first started flying around, my mom said "if it wasn't true, why would they write it?".   She was used to a world where publishing anything meant spending at least some amount of money, so maliciously false information was rare.

This is a new iteration of that.   It sounds like a person wrote the chatgpt output, so some people will assume that there is at least one person out there that believed what they wrote.   When in fact it's just a computer guessing.
