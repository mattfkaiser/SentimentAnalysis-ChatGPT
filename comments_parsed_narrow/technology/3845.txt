I asked chatGPT and it said “It depends on the context. If the AI is being used to provide feedback and guidance in a specific problem, it could be beneficial for students. However, if it is used in a way that allows students to simply input the problem and receive a solution without understanding the concepts, then it could be detrimental.”
