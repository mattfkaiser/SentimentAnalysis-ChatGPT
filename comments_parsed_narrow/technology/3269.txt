I understand your perspective, but I wholeheartedly disagree, so long as we are confining the discussion to the realm of poetry.

Poetry is subjective. There is no established measure of a "good poem". Nor is originality a prerequisite. Of course some resonate with people more than others, and of course when asked to write something "in the style of" someone else, it will fall short, but if you read 10 poems, I put good money that if one of those 10 is written by AI, reviewers will not be able consistently discern which of the 10 was written by AI. This hardly even requires proof, given that English professors have to use AI detection tools to accomplish the same thing for essays.

Further evidence, a similar generative AI for art has already accomplished the analogous feat: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html)

I will return to this post once an article is published citing ChatGPT (or similar such tech) winning a poetry slam to seal the debate in my favor. I predict < 3 months.
