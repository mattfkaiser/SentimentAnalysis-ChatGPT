Hi. 

I am coding since 35 years. 

If he is talking about tools like copilot and copilot chat then the CEO is completely right.

If he’s only taking about chatGPT then maybe not so much.

If you are a skilled developer these tools, copilot+copilot chat+chatgpt+playground+custom tools build on gpt4, speed you up so incredibly.

And not only do they speed you up but they make things possible for a single developer that he couldn’t possibly do alone before.

I trained gpt to almost code alone for me. Basically i‘m in the position to only describe him what i want, make a few adjustments but gpt writes most of the code itself. It has knowledge of my project, my code and everything related to it and i can have a chat with it about security issues, better implementation, refactoring, and so on. It knows my coding style and how i like to approach problems. It also knows my preferred library’s and library’s i don’t like for reasons.

It even creates my commit descriptions based on the diff.

And don’t get me started on what copilot chat can do …
