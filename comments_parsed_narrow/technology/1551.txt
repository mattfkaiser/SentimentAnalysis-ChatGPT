I heard a suggestion the other day that I think is an excellent idea: what if we restructure assignments in school to allow the use of the internet?

In my opinion, we shouldn't be making students memorize facts just for the sake of spitting them out on a test. Tests should ask students questions that make them think, not questions they could usually just Google and get an answer to.

I also believe homework shouldn't generally be a required thing. Some of the best teachers I've ever had have made their homework act as something students could look at if they didn't fully understand a concept so they could get extra practice. This is the right way to do it IMO. Give students free time, they're only a kid once.

The problem with ChatGPT is that it thinks for people. If it cuts down on busywork and homework, which is what might happen, great. If teachers keep assigning all their major assignments to be done at home, people are going to cheat, which doesn't help anything and at that point you're essentially admitting that there's no reason for the student to have to take your class.

Tl;Dr I hope ChatGPT allows us to rework how we do things in education and start teaching students how to think critically and identify patterns. If things don't change, it's going to become a huge problem and people will rely on ChatGPT to think for them.
