People are dumb as rocks. I watched a user use ChatGPT to make replies to users here on Reddit and it was obvious what he was doing based on the tone and structure of the replies, but people didn't catch on and kept replying, arguing, of all things, that AIs couldn't replace humans in real conversation.

It's true, they can't yet, but only for people who are mildly intelligent or observant. For the slow ones among us, a lot of people literally don't notice. Which really makes sense considering the fact that tons of clickbait low hanging fruit journalism is all written by AI now and people still eat it up.
