CAREFUL: This whole media circus is probably misled - __these briefs were (probably) NOT written by ChatGPT!__.

The 'ChatGPT using lawyers' here have been making shit up and have been lying about it the whole time. I think it's far more plausible they have simply lied about this too; "ChatGPT just made these cases up" is less embarassing/disbarment-level sanctionable behaviour than "__I__ made this shit up".

The thing ChatGPT purportedly made is shoddy exactly in the ways ChatGPT wouldn't have been. ChatGPT tends to create things that really fit the form and the style well but then in detail isn't well argued or just makes logical leaps that make no sense. This is the opposite: A simple and effective case (entirely fake, so that isn't legally relevant), written in the equivalent of crayon.

[Opening Arguments podcast episode 751](https://openargs.com/oa751-chatgpt-writes-fake-opinions-real-judge-is-not-amused/) does a pretty good job of covering this stuff.
