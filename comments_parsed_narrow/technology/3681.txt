It’s kind of like “Google can get you 10,000 results, but for one good answer, you need a librarian.”

Also if you’re not a realtor and you’re looking for a new place, you just don’t know what you don’t know! And ChatGPT can’t fill in the gaps for you. A good realtor can, and will help you avoid a lot of problems.

Problem is there are a lot of bad realtors out there (unfortunately).
