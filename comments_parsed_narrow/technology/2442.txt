Interestingly, ChatGPT took 48 seconds to give me a recipe for making pasta. And it didn't include much detail per step.

Google took about 0.2 seconds, with 4 seconds of scrolling the page to find the recipe.

They differed in the amount of salt and oil to use, and the Google recipe page informed me the oil was optional, and had a lot more info about what to look for during the process of making it.

The "useless crap" from Google has always been a non-issue for me personally, as I literally grew up ignoring the ads. Once ChatGPT is integrated with Microsoft, I am certain it'll start giving you ads as well.
