According to a [video](https://youtu.be/zLnhg9kir3Q) by [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) (of WolframAlpha notoriety), one key aspect of ChatGPT is that it avoids falling into static looping behavior by choosing a random "good enough" response instead of the response with the highest probability of being correct. So, the solution you received, although better than most responses it gave, may have been a rather low-scoring response compared to giving no answer at all. Also, speaking from experience, I find ChatGPT takes recent conversation text (something like the latest couple thousand words) into account when generating a response; the weight of your original prompt may have become diluted or bumped out of what ChatGPT considers by ChatGPTâ€™s own responses as well as your own clarifications.
