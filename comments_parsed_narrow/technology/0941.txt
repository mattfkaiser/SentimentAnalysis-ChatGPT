I would love to see chatgpt deal with my patients lol. “What brings you in?” “I don’t know!  I didn’t call the ambulance!”  “Who did?”  “I don’t know! Stop asking me so many questions. Ask him!”  “Sir, what brings you guys to the ED today?”  “I don’t know. She just didn’t seem right.”  “Can you elaborate?” “No”
