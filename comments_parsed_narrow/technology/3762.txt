Google has been making innovations tho, it’s just in the AI space Google has been very conservative in public usage/interactions because the ethics, laws, and use in that space is very vague and has huge potential for serious damage to googles brand as well as the future of AI. For example Googles internal use of AI has been very impressive and unique, like RankBrain, BERT, MUM, neural matching, not to mention how AI/ML is leveraged in almost everyone of their projects especially in non-generative spaces like earthquake detection or disease prevention.

ChatGPT has been super cool but rn there’s a lot of hype surrounding it, we’re still very early stages AI development, and who knows how well it will age (especially with how it’s common for chat focused models to output bad info, we haven’t seen the real impact of that and how it will shift perceptions of AI).
