Right now chatgpt is great just that, chatting, i can see it being used to entertain lonely old people in retirement homes like those little toy robots. In comparison I’ve tested the bing version lately and it’s already a lot better at being factual than chatgpt, give it a couple years and there will probably be more specified models interacting with other algorithms to be useful. The language model could just be an interface and not make the actual decisions, that could be left to more sophisticated models trained for that specific purpose.
