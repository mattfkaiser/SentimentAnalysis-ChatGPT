I just started playing with chat GPT, and despite all the hype, it really is in a fantastic tool for writing short documents. I was really impressed. If Google has something that can do a better job than that would be great. The Google needs to see what ordinary people in management or Line staff need in their work as a tool to help them do their jobs. For example I write policies and procedures as a manager. If I had a tool that helps me write those policies better, that would be fantastic. It has to be easy to use with no learning curve and it has to produce a product that I can adapt for what I need.  As for chat GPT replacing google search engine, people don’t understand in the computer world what people like me need. I am not going to stop using Google Chrome, because it is easy to use and it doesn’t have any distracting features. I am always learning new software programs and it’s a waste of my effing time. Having simple and easy to use software that does what it needs to do in order to make my job easier is essential.
