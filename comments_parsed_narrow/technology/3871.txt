Thank you!!! If I'm studying and stuck on a concept, I want to get an answer quickly so I can move on. Not waste time searching for the answer. And thats the problem with googling, its a huge waste of time where you're scouring web pages looking for what you need. Or I can read through an entire textbook chapter (again) hoping it has what I want to know.

But to be transparent, being in college, there is a stark divide between students who use ChatGPT.

There are one type of  lazy students who will use it to answer entire essay prompts or write their cover letters and essays.

But there are also students who don't understand a topic and will throw a question in there mid lecture for clarification. Or use it to break down lines of code, or understanding of a topic or clarify a concept.

It's really good with technology related concepts that have a lot of info online or in academic journals, but some more obscure sources it provides bad information. Can't wait until it gets better with ChatGPT 5 and on.
