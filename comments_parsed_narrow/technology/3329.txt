>To show up as the leadership of the community. The audience isn't just people on the internet; it's people who were present and grieving and horrified.

I honestly don't understand why anyone cares. To me that's like complaining the message was typewritten instead of taking the time to write it by hand.

It's a tool. If the controversy was that ChatGPT wrote something inappropriate that they posted anyway because they didn't bother to read the output, I get it. But as long as they read it and agreed with what it said, it's a tool. Like using a thesaurus or dictionary to find the right words.

They typed up a prompt indicating what they wanted to say, and used an advanced tool to help them word it well. That's what the fucking tool is for, and it's ridiculous anyone is outraged by that. Would people also be angry if they used an online thesaurus to find better words to convey what they want? Or a google search for a template to determine how such a letter should be phrased?
