I refer you back to my original statement:

*This is definitely user error, in as much as the user doesn't understand that ChatGPT is fundamentally unreliable, but it's also chatGPTs fault for being unreliable.*

I agree it’s user error, and *my* expectations of anything ChatGPT creates are very low, because the error bars on its answers can be 100%… it’s a toy.
