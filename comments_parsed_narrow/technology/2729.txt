I don't think anyone 10 years ago would have predicted the rise of things like AI image generators with the sheer quality of what we have now, nor the evolution of something like chatGPT. Yeah we had chatbots and shit but this is FAR beyond any of that and it's developing FAST.

Look perhaps you're right and these things really will start hitting major road blocks that prevent further development, but I don't think we can really use the past as a benchmark for how fast things are going to move in the future, at least when it comes to AI. Things are accelerating FAST, a lot of big companies and groups are heavily interested, and I would not be surprised to see something like chatGPT developing far beyond what it is now just in the next couple of years.
