Yesterday I spent 20 minutes googling a specific but rather basic solution to a task I wanted to do in SQL. I was doing multiple different searches trying to get something that was specific to Hive SQL and couldn’t get it. I put the problem in chatgpt and it gave me the wrong but close answer. I gave an example of the data I was working with and it gave another answer that gave me an error. I put the error code in and it said “oh if you are working with hive then you have to do it this way”. And it was correct. It was like talking to a person. Absolutely amazing, and blows google out of the water. To be able to add and specify based on the results you initially get is extremely powerful and is what google is lacking.

It can’t replace people. But it can really help someone like me who knows what a correct solution looks like but might not know the specific steps to get there.

For people wondering: I was looking for how to filter for data after a specific date but my date column was in string format and I was using hive sql (most threads I found were mysql). If anyone finds a google search with the right code that chat gpt gave me I’d be surprised. Chatgpt is also much quicker than sifting through 5 stack overflow threads
