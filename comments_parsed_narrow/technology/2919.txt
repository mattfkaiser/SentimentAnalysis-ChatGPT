My question is always, what exactly counts as using "AI" for writing. 

I know that generative AIs like chat GPT are easy to point at and say "that" . But I'm not being facetious here. It's actually a messy question. 

Does any computer aid in writing count? 

My writing ability would be crap without Microsoft word spell check. And no one called that cheating. 

What about Grammerly. It scans through documents and helps you proofread and make better sentence structures. (Like a better version of spell check). It even claims to use an AI when doing this. 

What about asking an AI to suggest sources for a paper writing. How is that get any different from googling it. (Is Google's algorithm really that different from an AI?) 

What if I write a rough draft of a paper, then give it to chat GPT and ask it to clean in up and sound more professional?


We don't ban calculators in math. Rather math classes teach you how to use a calculator properly. Teach students how to write. Then teach students what good writing looks like. And then teach them how to create good writing using something like chatGPT.
