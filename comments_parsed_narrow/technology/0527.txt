OpenAI are trying to have it both ways, from the article:

> the company also presents ChatGPT as a source of reliable data, describing the system in ad copy as a way to “get answers” and “learn something new.” OpenAI’s own CEO Sam Altman has said on numerous occasions that he prefers learning new information from ChatGPT than from books.

We're all informed enough to know ChatGPT is a text generator rather than a search engine, but OpenAI is actively promoting it as a search engine that offers reliable information. It's also pretty alarming that even their CEO allegedly uses it as such!
