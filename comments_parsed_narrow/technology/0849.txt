I am a professional creative, and what ChatGPT does (and Dall-E, etc.) is not copying anyone’s work. It is like a person learning about art from a museum, then creating new original works of art. Every artist learns from existing art and artists, and writers read a lot - that’s how creation usually works, and is in no way a violation of copyright. Copyright doesn’t mean you cannot learn from previous works, just that you cannot copy them.
