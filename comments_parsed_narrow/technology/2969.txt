As a data person at one of the two companies that you probably use for legal research (an probably the one you use based on your post), I am extremely concerned by our leadership's reaction to chatGPT.  Most technical people understand the limitations of the technology, especially when you need nuance and sources such as in the legal field, but management is concerned about something similar eating our lunch.  Hopefully this manifests itself in us improving our search and associated research tools but I don't see AI replacing tons of legal research and brief writing.

In the CS world we've had GitHub Co-pilot for a while now and while it can write useable code, ultimately you need to do a bunch of tweaking and code review so it's really best for boilerplate and simple, repeatable code structures.
