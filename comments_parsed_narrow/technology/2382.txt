I have had more success using it to find specific search results then I have with google. 

I've used it to create an exhaustive list of police jurisdictions around my country and their online report portals. I needed that for work and blew my boss away when I had 40+ in a day.

I've used it to fix formula problems in excel during data analysis at work minutes before I had to present the results of the data I collected.

I've used it to teach me the basics of python coding and give me practice sheets.

I've used it to create an example one-pager to send a short write-up about music I'm making for a video-game.

I've used it to figure out what the best setting is for my air exchange unit in my house to avoid moisture build-up on the windows during the winter. (It worked btw). 

Basically if you need to find something online. Chat GPT will usually get you there faster then Google now.
