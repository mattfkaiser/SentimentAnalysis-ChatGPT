I wasn't an English grad so I probably didn't write as many essays as others. But I think essays are a good way to practice research, application of your understanding, persuasive writing, and communicating your reasoning. 

I am a teacher now and I subscribe to the ideology "if it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you".

If this is the 5th essay you are writing this year it's probably not as much of a challenge for you, and is likely just tedium. It's good to practice but will have significantly less impact on your growth. I would agree that this needs to change in post secondary; professors normally have their focus on their own research and teaching is secondary so often they don't consider the methodology behind their instruction.

That said, using ChatGPT and submitting it as your own work for your academic profile is still plagiarism. Tech should be assistive, but not replacing your own evidence of learning.
