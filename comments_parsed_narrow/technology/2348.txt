Literally, anything.   


I am taking photographs for a Non-Profit Mountain Biking Womens event in a few weeks, and it asked ChatGPT to generate a shot list of or so things for the event. A bunch of the ideas were redundant, but a bunch of them were great! I feel much more prepared for the event.   


One of my buddies uses it to make all of his emails more "polished". My wife works with a team in India and they are now using it for most of the emails because it fixes their English. 

It has soooo many uses. As to learn about houseplants! If a plant strikes your fancy, ask about it! all kinds of stuff!
