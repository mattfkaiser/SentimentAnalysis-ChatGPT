I guess the analogy here is that using ChatGPT to write for you, you still need to know what it is in the end that you want to convey and you need to know when a text does not convey that. 

ChatGPT can however remove the need to write the sentences themselves or remove the need to by yourself write ”good” sentences. However you still need to check them if they convey what you want. I would say that it is the skill of writing well that is really threatened to become an obsolete school subject.
