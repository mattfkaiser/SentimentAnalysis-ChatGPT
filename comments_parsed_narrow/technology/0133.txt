I put your comment into ChatGPT and asked if it was AI generated. 

It told me 

> "Yes, the text you provided appears to have been generated by an AI language model. It exhibits the characteristic style and structure commonly seen in AI-generated text."

I asked it what those characteristics were, and one of the ones it listed was "Lack of personal experiences: AI-generated text generally lacks personal anecdotes, emotions, or subjective experiences"

When I pointed out that your comment was entirely personal anecdote, it replied

>Apologies for the confusion. Upon reviewing the quoted text again, I see that it does indeed include a personal anecdote. The specific mention of being a freelance writer, experiencing flagged writing, and being let go from clients and agencies due to accusations provides a personal account that may not align with typical AI-generated text. Therefore, I retract my previous statement that the quoted text was generated by an AI. It appears to be a human-authored text that includes personal experiences and perspectives from individuals within the freelance writing community.

I've been very impressed by how human-sounding ChatGPT's responses are. But it regularly seems to completely make up "facts", talk about them in an authoritative way, contradict itself and then back down the second you challenge it. So far it seems to be simulating the most annoying person you could possibly work with.
