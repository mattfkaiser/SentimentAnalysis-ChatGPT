Also, I’m not sure you read the article, but, the author of the research paper this article is based on says this:

> Still, Terwiesch said ChatGPT3’s performance on the test has “important implications for business school education, including the need for exam policies, curriculum design focusing on collaboration between human and AI, opportunities to simulate real world decision making processes, the need to teach creative problem solving, improved teaching productivity, and more.”’


So it did well in fact-based analysis and case studies, but also failed basic math, and creative problem solving which more and more MBA programs are incorporating into their courses [the author notes the need for more of this, this last part is from my own experience.]
