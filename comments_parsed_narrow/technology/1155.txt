> Speaking as a teacher, the formal essay writing crap is going the way of the dinosaur. There are about a million other ways a student can demonstrate their understanding and this won't affect education nearly as much as people think it will. Plagiarism of any kind gets a zero. There's no point trying it and it is in fact easily detectable, and kids who plagiarise are often too stupid to know that we KNOW their level of ability. If Timmy who pays zero attention in class and fucks around all the time suddenly writes like a uni student, you immediately google the phrases that seem too advanced for them and it will return the page immediately (strings of phrases are incredibly specific due to length).

ChatGPT, rewrite the above in the style of a grade-school student who barely understands the material. Repeat stuff to make it three times as long.

> I think the way that people are writing essays is changing. It's not gonna be like it used to be. People can show their understanding in different ways now. Plagiarizing won't work at all. If you try to do it, you won't get any points. Teachers can tell if you're not writing at your level. Like, if the student usually doesn't pay attention or goofs off, but all of a sudden writes like they're in college, teachers are gonna know. The teachers can search the phrases that are too hard for the student to have known and it'll show up. So plagiarizing is a really bad idea. It's not gonna work.
