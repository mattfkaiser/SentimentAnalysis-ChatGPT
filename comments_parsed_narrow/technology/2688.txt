There actually is a working prototype (probably multiple but I only know of one) built by a dude at IBM that uses ChatGPT as an input/output for prompts and then can determine if it needs to reference additional AI/online tools (Wolfram Alpha included), pull in that data, then provide it. All while being read back to you using AI text-to-speech with a digital avatar.

I forget the name but saw it on Youtube the other day. Essentially a context-based Swiss army knife of AI/SE tools. Shit is gonna be wild in 5-10 years.
