I think this is actually a perfect example.  Because the moon landings and the first powered flight, although both involve flight and to a lay person that's probably all they need to convince them it was one path of development, they were completely different lines of technological development. Aeroplane technology would never get us to the moon, it was rockets and computer guidance systems.

That's kind of like where we're at with ChatGPT vs "true" AI.  Yes ChatGPT can generate human-like responses, but we will need a completely new technology to build AI that can come up with original thought and that just doesn't exist yet, not even in any kind of development stage.
