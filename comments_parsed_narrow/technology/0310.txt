Thanks for this. Am doctor. Was looking for a similar comment. Docs learn the rare stuff first a lot of the time. Joke in doc circles about that sometimes. Good example is pheochromocytoma, which a 2021 paper of over 5 million people over 7 years found 239 cases. Fancy math on their part that for every 100,000 years of being alive, half a person would be diagnosed with pheo (0.55 per 100,000 patient-years). So like. 1 in 200,000 years of living. Now. Every doctor trained in Canada (at least) knows what Pheo is, who it tends to happen to, how to diagnose it, and the ‘triad’ of symptoms that should make your brain go ‘pheo.’ So. Rare does not necessarily mean doctors don’t know about it or can’t diagnose it ((I recognize for the medical folks reading there that there are challenges in diagnosing pheo, but if we are talking about a question stem prompt like the ChatGPT had here, it’s a different thing)).  IMHO, my training really emphasized lethal, including lethal and rare, which was sometimes at the expense of getting the same expertise in what to do about the common and, while bothersome (or even disabling), not life-threatening things. Funny how people can see ‘not even knowing about something basic like [fill in the blank]’ is seen as ineptitude or incompetence when in fact it’s just that your doc is an expert in things that belong in a whole different ballgame of death/disease/danger. Also. The population estimates on non-classic CAH also seem a lot more common than 1:100,000. So even if we were going by rarity, I don’t think they got that stat right. All this is more just a continuation of the discussion and not specific response to you.

If anyone wants the pheo paper, [have fun.](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/configurable/content/journals$002feje$002f184$002f1$002fEJE-20-0628.xml?t:ac=journals%24002feje%24002f184%24002f1%24002fEJE-20-0628.xml)
