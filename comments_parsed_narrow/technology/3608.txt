And on top of that obvious challenge, there’s also “what counts as AI generated?”.

There are a ton of ways to use AI in writing books which fall short of “the AI wrote this book” - you can have the AI suggest character names and traits, suggest exciting situations for them to run into on their journey, give you a premise and detailed outline of the story, generate some scenery porn on entering a new setting, or help you with wording trickier passages, among many other ways.

If an author uses AI assistance to generate a book, so the end result is 80% the AI’s words but they wrote critical portions of it, put a lot of effort into guiding the AI’s efforts, editing and regenerating responses, and so forth until they had a result that they were happy with… is that an “AI-written book”? And no matter how you’re inclined to answer that, where exactly do we draw the line?

There’s a whole continuum between “old-fashioned human writing” and “letting ChatGPT ramble about something for a while and calling it a book”, and we’re going to see books published at every possible position on that continuum without having any idea how heavily AI was involved.
