He should have used his own product to write an apology.... Here is what chatGPT has to say when I asked it to write an apology about students using it to cheat.

As a language model, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses, not to facilitate academic dishonesty. I strongly encourage all users to use my abilities ethically and responsibly.
