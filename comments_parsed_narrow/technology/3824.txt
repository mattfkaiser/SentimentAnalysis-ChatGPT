I’ll be honest when I say ChatGPT has made studying in computer networking much easier, and it’s allowed me to retain much more helpful information. The most I use ChatGPT for is writing outlines for essays, which is probably the hardest part of the essay process for me.

The app is incredibly helpful, and more people should have access to it. Academic dishonesty is bad though, don’t ask it to write your papers
