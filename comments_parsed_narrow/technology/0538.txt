It's a disclaimer, not a get out of jail free card.

You don't get to sell sandwiches to kiosks/stores with a little "not fit for human consumption" sign _whilst also operating a drive through where you're selling them to humans for immediate consumption_.

It's easily foreseeable that there will be issues.

My "hate boner" is for the fact OpenAI rushed these models into production usage for some quick cash, rather than actually accepting they're not fit for widespread use.
