Probably an unpopular opinion on Reddit (everywhere else I see AI discussion has a different tone) but, I just think how much people are already like “BUT I DEPEND ON THIS!” Is weird. Like, how competent were you before it came out? I think being concerned about someone’s actual competence at their job or in school because of their dependence on ChatGPT is a real thing to be concerned about.

The amount of times I see on Reddit, “I ran this through ChatGPT and it said this!” Like they did something impressive. The tool is impressive, someone being reliant/dependent on it is not. 

Time will tell, but so far the discussion around it sounds like I’m talking to people asking for ChatGPT for a response and just replying with that rather than having a normal discussion.
