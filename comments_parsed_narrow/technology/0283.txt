ChatGPT can do this and thatâ€¦but can it own the responsibility when thing goes wrong??  For example, I seen it passed the bar, mcat and etc, but will it be responsible if thing goes wrong? Patient dies or failing to do justice, is the developer and company going to be responsible for chatgpt?  At least the lawyer or doctor can be held responsible.  That probably why there is blocks in place on what it does.
