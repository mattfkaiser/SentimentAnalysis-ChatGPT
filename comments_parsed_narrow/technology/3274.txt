I call this BS. Even if ChatGPT is the perfect solution, it takes time for companies to change the business process. But we all know ChatGPT doesn't always output the right answer, so there is also the additional step of risk management. Claiming the usage of ChatGPT for coding is even a bigger stretch.

ChatGPT will have a lot of usages, but the term "already" is BS. Many company has the intention to use it, but the how and the when is still in the future.
