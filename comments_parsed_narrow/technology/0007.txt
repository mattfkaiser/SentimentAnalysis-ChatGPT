If it's [this story](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/texas-am-chatgpt-ai-professor-flunks-students-false-claims-1234736601/), it's 100% of the students. The students were denied diplomas. Dude was a rodeo instructor who taught an animal science course at Texas A&M. Students put his doctoral thesis (written before ChatGPT was released) and the e-mail the professor sent through the same test, and ChatGPT said both could have been written by ChatGPT.

I don't often use the phrase "dumb as nails," but it applies to this instructor.

It's a special kind of dumb that thinks everyone is out to get them and everyone else is stupid and they're the only person with brains -- it's more common in Texas than elsewhere. Fucking *rodeo instructor* thinks he can out-internet-sleuth his entire class but can't even spell ChatGPT correctly (he consistently referred to it as "Chat GTP" in the e-mail he sent telling students they failed).
