Comparing this to calculators does not seem right. Calculators are a tool and can only be used as such. In most cases you don't really understand anything about math unless you know what to even plug into a calculator.

You plug stuff into chatGPT for essays but this isn't really the same thing. It defeats the entire purpose of writing an essay. An essay is YOUR chance to put your thoughts and opinions out there in a measured way. Having an AI do it for you takes away anything that would give that essay value.
