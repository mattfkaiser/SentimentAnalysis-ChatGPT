Yes, I really think people are vastly underestimating how much personal interactions and orality factor in both academia and the workforce. Like, my whole major is based around text and yet roughly half of my assignments include either explaining things orally thoroughly or just downright participating in debates. Yes ChatGPT is a game changer but I would never say it does my work for me. I imagine other majors might be different but if you're only ever graded on writing idk if you're getting a *great* quality of education tbh.

And later on it's not even just job interviews, it's basically everything. If someone with no skills can do a job with chatGPT, that position will simply be automated, and the jobs that are left will require something more.
