I know lol. I had a case at work a few week ago of a person putting in a large amount of private data and telling them how to do something with it. Mind you this is confidential information. It is audited as well so it has to be kept secret and confidential and some dude is slapping it into chatgpt and saying I want to do this with it. 

He had a stern talking to...not by me but the CTO ðŸ˜†
