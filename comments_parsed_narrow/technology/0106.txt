Nah. If I specifically tell you “Here’s my question. Don’t answer if you don’t know for certain. I would rather hear ‘I don’t know’ than a made-up response.” then a human will take that instruction into consideration. ChatGPT will flat-out ignore you and just go right ahead and answer the question whether it knows anything on the topic or not.

Every time there’s a new revision, the first thing I do is ask it “Do you know what Talislanta is?” It always replies with the Wikipedia information… it’s a RPG that first came out in the late 80s, by Bard Games, written by Stephen Sechi, yada yada. Then I ask it “Do you know the races of Talislanta?” (This information is NOT in Wikipedia.) It says yes, and gives me a made-up list of races, with one or two that are actually in the game.

Oddly, when I correct it and say “No, nine out of ten of your example races are not in Talislanta” it will apologize and come up with a NEW list, this time with a higher percentage of actual Talislanta races! Like, for some reason when I call it on its BS it will think harder and give me something more closely approximating the facts. Why doesn’t it do this from the start? I have no idea.
