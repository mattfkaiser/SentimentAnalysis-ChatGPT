Well, ChatGPT just told me it *doesn't* make stuff up. So it's callin' you a liar.

>As an AI language model, I do not "make stuff up" in the way that humans might understand it. Instead, I generate responses based on patterns and relationships that I've learned from analyzing vast amounts of text data.

>However, it is true that I sometimes provide responses that are unexpected or unusual, and this can give the impression that I am making things up.
