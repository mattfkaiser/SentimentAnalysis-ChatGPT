As a scientist, I have noticed that ChatGPT does a good job of writing *as if it knows things* but shows high-level conceptual misunderstandings.

So a lot of times, with technical subjects, if you really read what it writes, you notice it doesn't really understand the subject matter.

A lot of students don't either, though.
