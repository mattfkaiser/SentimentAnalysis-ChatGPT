I'd doubt it. AI as it exists today doesn't write - it regurgitates. That makes it excellent for drawing from an enormous database of knowledge and answering multiple choice questions or writing simple essays. 

Yeah an AI can implement rhyme, meter, and _formatting_ commonly present in poetry. It can easily write haiku, or limericks, or in the style of John Milton during the first two years three months six days and a handful of minutes of his writing career. But these are _details_, not _skills_. 

If you want an example, here's Frost's _The Road Not Taken_:

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

> And sorry I could not travel both

> And be one traveler, long I stood

> And looked down one as far as I could

> To where it bent in the undergrowth;

> Then took the other, as just as fair,

> And having perhaps the better claim,

> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

>Though as for that the passing there

> Had worn them really about the same,

> And both that morning equally lay

>In leaves no step had trodden black.

> Oh, I kept the first for another day!

> Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

> I doubted if I should ever come back.

> I shall be telling this with a sigh

> Somewhere ages and ages hence:

> Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”

> I took the one less traveled by,

> And that has made all the difference.

Now here's ChatGPT writing a poem about travel in the style of Frost:

> On paths less trodden, I often roam

> To wander far from familiar home

> In search of sights I've yet to see

> And the beauty that lies ahead of me

> I take the road that winds and curves

> Through mountains high and valleys swerves

> The snow-capped peaks, the rolling hills

> My heart with wanderlust it fills


> The journey's long, the way unclear

> But I trudge on, free from fear

> For every step brings new surprise


> And adventure that before me lies

>Through forests thick and deserts dry

> I travel on, with open eye

> To see the world, in all its grace

> And find my own unique place

> So here's to travel, and all it brings

> The joy, the awe, the wondrous things

> May we never tire of the road

> And find in travel, our own abode

It lacks soul. It reads like the poetry of a throw blanket. It understands that Frost rhymed words, that adjectives describe nouns, and that imagery connects to human emotions. But it's just a process. There's no conscious decision to experiment, to understand that some words might sound more enjoyable to a human ear than others, or how to be sarcastic or subversive. And perhaps most importantly, these systems will always create mediocrity of form _because they are trained to synthesize everything available_. 

It can't win large poetry contests, for the same reason it would never write anything groundbreaking - it lacks creativity.
