All memes aside about obvious weak points, ChatGPT is fucking amazing. Playing with it right now, asking compsci questions to see what it knows and how clear the answers are. No wonder Google raised a red alert about it, easily could fuck up their search business for good. Big thing is it remembers what was talked about, so asking for clarifications is way easier than refining google query. This is the future.
