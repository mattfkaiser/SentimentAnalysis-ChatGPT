Right, but if you know the language even a little you can still use translation tools to do the bulk of the work and then just edit and tweak things. The same is true of tools like ChatGPT. Would I trust it to write a whole essay? Fuck no. But you could come up with an outline, prompt ChatGPT for pieces of the essay bit by bit, edit what it gives you, and probably end up with a decent essay (provided the topic isnâ€™t really complex) with ChatGPT having done most of the time-consuming grunt work.
