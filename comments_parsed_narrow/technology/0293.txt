Did something change with the new version? I tried to ask Chatgpt to pick some good options a couple months ago and it told me it wasn't allowed to give financial advice.

Edit: just tried again, can't get it to give me any sort of stock advice, not even in the way this article asked. Confused as to why they're citing statistics with regard to number of people who have already used Chatgpt to do this.
