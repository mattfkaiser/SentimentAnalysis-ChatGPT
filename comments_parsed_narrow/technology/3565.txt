On the consumer side, there's no difference. On the author side, at least if you wrote the trash yourself instead of outsourcing it, you might pick up some skills/experience that would enable you to write better in the future.

I think the issue people don't get is the amount of effort it would take for chatgpt to get from where it is now to writing coherent novels. [Scott McCloud's take on art and how people progress through it](https://dyn1.heritagestatic.com/lf?set=path%5B2%2F2%2F4%2F1%2F2%2F22412833%5D%2Csizedata%5B850x600%5D&call=url%5Bfile%3Aproduct.chain%5D) applies here, too.

ChatGPT excels at the surface-level stuff: for the most part, its sentences are well-structured and it's good at technical writing. I think you could arguably say that it's good at the "craft" level of things as well since it is superior to other AI in how it organizes ideas.

As it is now, though, anything composition and deeper is beyond what ChatGPT can do. This is why art AI also struggled with things like hands for awhile: they don't have any actual understanding of anatomy/story structure/etc. of how things are composed.

But like you said, this is also an issue with inexperienced authors/artists. It may be a little different, because some new authors could be good at plotting a story (Structure/craft) but bad at stringing together coherent sentences (surface), meaning that their ideas get lost in the sauce.
