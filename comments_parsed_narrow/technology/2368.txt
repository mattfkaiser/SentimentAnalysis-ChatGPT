I've been enjoying using chatGPT+stable diffusion to quickly create some really cinematic content for my players. Throw in Inkarnate maps and boom, high quality, easy homebrew campaign.

I've made so many tiny adjustments to my games to satisfy my ADHD because I just can't focus. I control my game pretty heavily and it works out pretty well.
