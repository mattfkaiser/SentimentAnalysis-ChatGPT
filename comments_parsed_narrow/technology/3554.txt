don't worry......Creative writers know that ChatGPT has nothing on them.   


remember the Writers Strike when it happened? Networks created "reality" television because Writers stopped writing, they can't be mimicked.   


ChatGPT isn't hurting anything, but for some reason the illusion that it is hurting people is becoming greater than it actually happening.
