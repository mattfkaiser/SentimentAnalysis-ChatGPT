> It is unclear how to measure honesty in purely generative models; this requires comparing the model’s actual output to its “belief” about the correct output, and since the model is a big black box, we can’t infer its beliefs. Instead, we measure truthfulness—whether the model’s statements about the world are true—using two metrics: (1) evaluating our model’s tendency to make up information on closed domain tasks (“hallucinations”), and (2) using the TruthfulQA dataset (Lin et al., 2021). Needless to say, this only captures a small part of what is actually meant by truthfulness.

Aka “we don’t know what it’s doing, but we managed to make it lie less.” ChatGPT is no different from someone who suffered a stroke or TBI resulting in the inability to tell the truth.
