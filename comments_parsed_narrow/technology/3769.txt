Teacher here. ChatGPT scares the hell out of me. Since winter break, I’ve had my students do all assessed work on paper. This isn’t an issue solely caused by a fancy new AI; the ability to Google a summary of a book rather than reading it already existed. But ChatGPT pushed me over the edge. 

However, I did have ChatGPT write a lesson plan for me once, so it has its uses.
