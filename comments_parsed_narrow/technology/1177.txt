Understand that ChatGPT in it's current form makes no attempt at all to be factually accurate. *That is not it's purpose*. This is not a criticism, I am saying that nothing like a fact search is even in the thing.

It's sole purpose is to produce coherent sounding words. It is a comprehensibility engine.

That being said, it should be viewed not as a thing that gathers knowledge BUT it can be made to be a front end to a more traditional search engine.

How it will be used is that a user will not input a "prompt" for GPT itself but for a search engine. The search engine will glean facts and form them into a simple prompt and feed *that* into GPT. It won't ask GTP for fact, it will provide facts and task GPT with putting them into pleasant to read paragraphs.

As it is now, one of your students who know the subject they've been asked to write on could provide GPT with bullet-point facts and get a "paper" out of it. But they need to provide the facts because GPT isn't set up to find them itself.
