I agree with this completely. I was a decent student and I went to college and got a political science degree. I don't remember very much from school but the most important thing it taught me was how to read information and pull out relevant aspects (peer reviewed sources news articles etc). I had to memorize a bunch of useless shit and I've been out of school 3 years and I remember none of it


Chatgpt will only make this more important for a couple reasons
1. Any basic surface level information it can provide to you in a few minutes as long as it's asked correctly
2. It's at least at the moment very confident even when it's wrong so you need to know enough to correct it 
3. It uses the internet to find information but it doesn't check the validity of the sources
