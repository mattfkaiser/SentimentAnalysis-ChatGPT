Honestly, as a student my use of ChatGPThas been to learn the topic itself. I don’t think it’s altogether that useful for writing a 2,500word essay comprehensively. Much better to use it to find and explain the concepts behind the topics your trying to understand even if you aren’t good at essays the value of ChatGPT at the moment in writing them (at a high level) has been far overstated (for now) and your better off using it, (like so much else people try to cheat with) as a learning tool so you actually understand the information you’re working with.
