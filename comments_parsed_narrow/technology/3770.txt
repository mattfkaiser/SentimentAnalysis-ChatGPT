Relevant to the article; the ability to explore the concept of math through experimenting (playing) with you calculator - is a very similar process to using ChatGPT - unstructured exploration through a coded system which engages the user's brain.

I'm sure we'll get "safe" versions of ChatGPT that will be child friendly; "every child with a personal AI to teach and guide them" - but the ideology of the tech company will set the bounds. If there's religious fundamentalists funding the training, and you have a bible friendly AI, similar to bible games, then it won't free humanity from the trappings of religion, it'll reinforce those concepts.

Similarly you could make a calculator that doesn't support negative numbers.
