passing an interview is not the same thing as doing the actual job. as a software engineer, 70% of my job is dealing with existing code, reading logs, troubleshoot issues, investigate why a problem in datacenter1 is impacting datacenter2 when they are unrelated (a lot of magic). the rest of is coding fixes and writing documentation, and maybe 5% for new features and implementations.
