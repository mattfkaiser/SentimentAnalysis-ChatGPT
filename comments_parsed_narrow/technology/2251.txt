I work in research and I'm from a CS background.

Google existed when i was doing my undergrad. I had to make a conscious choice to not just copy-paste code for whole assignments when I was a student and write my own.

I'm glad I did. I would have screwed myself over.

Of course in industry and elsewhere we copy-paste code all the time but it's important you fully understand it if needed.

In my current job colleagues often come to me when they are having trouble with some R code or some IT issues.

The other day a friend emailed me with a problem involving an obscure R library.

I couldn't answer off the top of my head and would have needed to spend some time going down some stackoverflow rabbit holes

As an experiment I simply showed chatgpt a few lines of  code and described the problem she was having.

It proposed a solution (the same one I first thought of) but that gave an error.

So I just showed it the error. It took the error intp account and offered a fix.

But there was something else wrong. 

Repeat because there was also an issue caused by how my colleague had named columns.

3 layers of errors in it offers a small code block that fixed all the problems and got the code working as desired.

That floored me. Probably half an hour of digging through forum threads about libraries turned into seconds to get working code.

Intelligent and reactive bug fixing.

This is going to change the workplace in a big way.
