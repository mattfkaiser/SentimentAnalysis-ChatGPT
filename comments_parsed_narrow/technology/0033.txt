I asked chatgpt to describe when Kaladin Stormblessed swore the fourth ideal and it repeatedly told me the third ideal. Even after stopping it and telling it it was wrong. 

It made a valid outline for a story I'm likely never going to make, but I had to provide it in the right direction many times. 

Chat GpT and it's current form is just a tool. Same thing with AI art.

 I wish it would be covered more as tools cuz so many people think it's God.

Also a lot of people watch way too many movies
