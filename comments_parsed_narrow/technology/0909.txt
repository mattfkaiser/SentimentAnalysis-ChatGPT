Someone explained to me why chatgpt is so good for coding but nothing else. They said that code is much much easier to verify than a "fact". If I ask it about the history of the Mona Lisa, I can't just look at the response and verify if it's real or not. With code, you can determine if it makes sense before running it, to some degree. You can't mathematically determine that the history of the Mona Lisa is wrong, but you can mathematically determine if a paragraph of code makes sense or not (to some degree)

Also, the programmers that make internet content, that chatgpt learns from, are probably more accurate in general than most internet people. Stack overflow is a mean place that will let you know how wrong you are about your entire understanding of computers, but they are not wrong over there lol.
