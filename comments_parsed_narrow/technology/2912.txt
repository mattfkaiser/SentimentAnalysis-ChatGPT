The fallacy in your argument is that it is not a ‘skill’ to prompt ChatGPT to write your paper for you.

In the same way that it is not a ‘skill’ to go on Fiverr and hire someone in the third world to write your paper for you. 

Sure, if AI gets to a certain point, it could theoretically replace human writers. But we’re not even close to there yet. 

In the same way that theoretically, robots might be able to wipe our asses for us some day. But you’re going to be pretty disadvantaged in the world if you don’t know how to wipe your own ass.
