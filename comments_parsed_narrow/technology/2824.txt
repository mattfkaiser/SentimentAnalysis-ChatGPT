On average so far, I've been able to get 1 to 2 hours of PowerShell scripting done in about 30 minutes with ChatGPT.  It's an impressive productive multiplier to say the least.  The best part is that the things I tend to find really tedious like input validation and working out yet another damn edge case, tend to be the easiest to explain to the interface and get some mostly workable code.
