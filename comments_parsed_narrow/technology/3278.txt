I’m already seeing lots of useless Reddit bots, AI generated articles, and AI generated YouTube content telling me how to get rich with chatGPT (meta as hell with a chatGPT avatar).

How long until the internet is just AI talking to itself?

We’re going to have to pull the plug aren’t we? as it eats up all the compute.
