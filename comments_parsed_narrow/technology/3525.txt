> Internet also is cheating

If you plagiarise, yes it’s cheating. On the other hand looking up the internet for information is no different than going to the library.

And there are software that can catch plagiarism. The problem is chatgpt would be so good at it in the future that it can create new content based on information from the net, and nobody would be the wiser.

I’m not saying chatgpt should be banned but it would negatively impact learning from homework/written assignments. And schools would probably have to load more on classworks to make sure students understand.
