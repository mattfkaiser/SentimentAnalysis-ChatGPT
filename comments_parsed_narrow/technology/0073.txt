Can confirm.  
It doesn’t help at all, haven’t used any of his tips/lines of code, it’s always about stackoverflow and Google in general, which is not only faster and easier to understand (chatGPT will usually need a google search to confirm/fix whatever it generates) but also more precise in details and “human-driven” (don’t have any other word to explain this but whoever had the same experience as me knows what I’m talking about).  
I like it as a tool, I use it mostly in my free time for fun, like asking some recipes for dinner or writing dumb stories about my friends and relatives
