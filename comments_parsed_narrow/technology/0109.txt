It's important to note here, and note repeatedly as the dialogue evolves, that ChatGPT *doesn't actually understand anything*. Even criticizing it as misunderstanding high-level concepts is a fundamental mistake in characterizing what it's doing and how it's generating output. It "misunderstands" things because it can't understand things in the first place. It has no coherent internal model of the world. It's a Chinese room with a pretty darn good dictionary that nevertheless has no way to check whether its dictionary is accurate.
