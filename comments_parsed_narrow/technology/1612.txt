I had much the same experience, as a non-coder looking to use ChatGPT to write code for me. At my job I have a fairly simple, annoying task I need to perform on a daily basis in the mornings, the kind of work ripe for automation. I wrote out a detailed English outline of what the program needed to do and I how I wanted it to go about doing it, then fed that into ChatGPT. It did write it for me, a simple Python program of about 50 lines, and to my limited knowledge it looked good, but it didn't work. Even after multiple rounds of using ChatGPT to debug, it still didn't work. I had to ask someone from the programming department at our company to take a look and it took him about 30 - 40 minutes to properly debug it. 

It has potential but I'm much less impressed after seeing its limits.
