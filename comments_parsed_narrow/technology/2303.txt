This might be fine if the point of essays was to just submit something, but it isn't. Essay writing teaches you to organize your ideas and present them in an intelligent manner. Teaches reading comprehension too. The "fluff in the middle" is the point. 

Having chatgpt write you an essay is essentially the same as using an essay writing service. Not doing the work yourself renders the assignment meaningless.
