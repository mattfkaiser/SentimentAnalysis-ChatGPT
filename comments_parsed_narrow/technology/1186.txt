In a way Plato was right. He's using a hyperbole, but the point is that time and effort spent on developing literary skills, neccesarily means that less time and effort is spent on developing oratory skills. The Native Americans for example were famous for their eloquence and reasoning skills, in part because public speaking was an important facet of native life. 

The reason this isn't an argument against books is that the ability to spread knowledge across time and space turned out to outweigh the disadvantages of declining oratory memory/skills. 

The question is, do the benefits of an AI like ChatGPT outweight the disadvantages they have on human learning/development? I think there is an argument that the answer should be no, unless AI is integrated into society in the right way.
