>Sadly the market is already flooded with shiite books

A lot of people don't realize how many of the books on Amazon are already being made by content farms. A friend worked for one for around a year, where a small team of ~6 people could churn out a formulaic romance novel every two months. They had algorithmically-derived plots and characters, and standardized style guides so that every writers' work would match up.

They even created a fake social media presence for the fake author getting credit for the book, just to help convince people that they were supporting an actual artist.

I really don't see ChatGPT as being particularly worse than that.
