**All** you need to fool (most) humans is confidence. 

Obviously when it comes to technical things it’s harder to bluff someone that knows what they’re talking about. 

But generally, you just have to act like you belong / know what you’re talking about and people will believe you. 

ChatGPT is a great example, it will very confidently spit out wildly wrong information and it’s quite hard to remember the answer could well be drastically wrong.
