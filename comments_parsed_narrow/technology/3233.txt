That's why I said it was too soon to actually be happening yet: companies aren't going to be using ChatGPT or similar AIs for customer service as-in because they're far too broad, which creates a lot potential problems. They will, however, be the basis of more limited AIs that are largely just trained on the company's documentation as well as existing customer service interactions, and just like ChatGPT has a lot of topics it refuses to discuss, they'll have to put in even more constraints to keep the conversation limited to appropriate topics.
