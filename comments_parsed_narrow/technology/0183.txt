1) These programs are "Machine Learning" and not actual Artificial Intelligence, they cannot learn, create new information nor distinguish truth from lie.

2) Machines cannot hold rights to any kind of work, so everything these programs are producing should be copyright free. If you try to sell a Midjourney image or a film which script has been done by Chat GPT then you are breaking copyright law. 

3) Some countries legal systems are less interested in these than Europe's,  usually thanks to lobbying or because the people at the top are technologically inept.
