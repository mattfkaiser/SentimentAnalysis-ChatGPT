this article is kind of vague. By "replace workers" do they mean that companies have laid people off/not hired more due to ChatGPT, or that ChatGPT has replaced workers in SOME tasks in the workplace, for example, replacing someone who normally summarizes meetings, and that person is free to do other things? They don't really go into the details of the survey in the article.
