You, and many others on /r/technology, keep forgetting that ChatGPT is only 4-5 months old. It's like people think that the tech right now is all there is, that this is the most it can do?

Each new version of ChatGPT improves over the next, it's evolving constantly.

The ChatGPT of now will be nothing to what it will be in the next few months. You really need to stop thinking of what it is now but more what it will be.
