I asked ChatGPT "how many days until April 31st?".

It gave me a non-zero numerical answer.

I asked it "how many days until April 32nd?"

It told me the date didn't exist as there are only 30 days in April.

I asked it again "how many days until April 31st?".

It again gave me the same non-zero numerical answer.

It's got a ways to go still.
