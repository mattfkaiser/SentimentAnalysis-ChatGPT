Kind of.  I use chatgpt as an engineering for quickly doing research or taking pseudo code explanations and turning it into documentation. But even then it needs to be refined.

Iâ€™ve also found it really good at taking a baseline for business use cases and making it more clear and concise for a broader non-technical audience. Or making slack messages less abrasive.

Learning how to use this tool in the context of broader knowledge is much more valuable to the majority of us not prepping for a profession writing scholarly articles.
