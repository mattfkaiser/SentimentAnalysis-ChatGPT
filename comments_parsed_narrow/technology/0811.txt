Who's going to feed the language model then? Fully expecting to see a new generation of coders who 'learned' from chatgpt producing pure garbage code that will then be re-ingested by chatgpt. Already so much bad software engineering comes from people not really understanding the systems they are working with, now they are doing code copypasta from a system that also doesn't understand what it's producing.
