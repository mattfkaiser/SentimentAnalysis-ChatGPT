Branding matters, ux matters, convenience matters, accessibility matters, press matters, etc and ChatGPT has obviously been quite successful (along those axes) at sparking public interest and engagement, which I don’t think should be discredited in considering the “significance” of it, independent of any of the underlying modeling. Tipping points, etc etc

Your blog and staff writers are probably great, and there will always be some (significant) place for that sort of content model, but think of the vast swaths of stupid, simple articles on the internet on shallow sites dedicated to pathetic attempts at grabbing ad revenue which are constantly pumped out - from news to basic tutorials to explainers etc etc. Half that junk for a decade has already felt like it was written by a bot anyways, and it seems pretty safe to say that whatever isn’t will be continually transition to being generated by language models whenever possible, especially as the tools mature and get better at SEO to boot. If your goal is to create a website which churns out content for selling dick pill ads, why wouldn’t you cut out human writers which may even be Mechanical Turk style labor already…
