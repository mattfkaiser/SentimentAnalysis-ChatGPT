Yeah no idea how google could even monetize that. “This response was brought to you by tide detergent” or forcing people to watch an ad before getting their response maybe. But that pales in comparison to having a user do a search and have the first result they see be something that the user was looking for and clicks. Or they could incorporate products/services into the AI but that would just decrease the performance of the AI. 

I think they will eventually have to release a competitor and use subscriptions to monetize. However, I keep seeing that google has better AI but have yet to release it so how do we even know that? I have seen how worried google is about chat GPT and this acquisition tells me that they may even be behind.
