As a software developer, and chatgpt user, I don't understand this.

I keep hearing about all these devs using chatgpt to x10 their productivity. Really?

It helps me out a lot of small things like: "I started using a new mocking library, write a unit test that does X", or "Write a regex that does X".

It saves me an 1-3 hours a week, max.

It's not like I can import my companies codebase (don't do that) of 1 million lines and tell it "write feature X".
