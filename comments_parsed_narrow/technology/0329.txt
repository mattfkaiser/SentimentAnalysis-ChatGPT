The case for why GPT won’t replace doctors is similar to why it won’t replace software engineers. Sure, GPT can code (mostly), but if you stick someone who has never coded a day in their life on a project to develop xyz, they won’t know where to begin, what questions to ask, how to evaluate the code, increase efficiency, etc. Chat GPT won’t ever replace programmers. Although, programmers who use Chat GPT will replace those who don’t. Chat GPT can do many things, but it won’t be replacing doctors, programmers, or lawyers
