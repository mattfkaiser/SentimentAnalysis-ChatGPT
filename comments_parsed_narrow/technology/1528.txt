I mean, you're right, but the question is *how do you objectively measure learning?*

We can't see inside a kid's brain. All we can see is the external results of that learning Now, a wider variety of assessment is absolutely called for. I teach in an alternate school, and we use conversation, presentation, and artistic expression to a large degree, and I'm always in favor of a wider variety of assessment practices. But at the end of the day, if I have a hypothesis that my students have learned something, I need to test that hypothesis in a measurable way. If I can't demonstrably prove that learning, I am not holding up my responsibility to that student, their parents who have entrusted that student into my care, or the society that expects an educated citizenry.

This is all, in my opinion, unrelated to ChatGPT. I love the thing, and have already incorporated it into my lessons.
