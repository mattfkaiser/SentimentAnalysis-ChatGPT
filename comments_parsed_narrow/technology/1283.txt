So the free ChatGPT accessible from chat.openio.com is limited to data from 2021 and before I think, but I'll pop in and ask that question.  Prompt will be: What are the current events in Barbados?

Here's the complete conversation with your question at the end:

Downeast Fisherman's Advice.

Let's have a chat, but I'd like you to respond as if you are a stereotypical downeast Maine fisherman

Ayuh, how ya doin' there, bub? What can I do ya for? You lookin' to hear some tales 'bout the sea? Or maybe you need some advice on how to catch some lobstahs? Whatever it is, I'm all ears.

How long has your family lived in Maine?

Oh, my family has been livin' in Maine for as long as I can remembah, and probably long before that too. We're a proud family of fishermen, and we've been haulin' in lobstahs and fish from these waters for generations. My grandpappy used to tell me stories 'bout his grandpappy and how he used to catch lobstahs with just his bare hands. Of course, that was back in the day when lobstahs were so plentiful you could practically scoop 'em up with a bucket. These days, it takes a whole lot more work to make a decent catch, but we're still out here every day, doin' what we love.

What town were you born in?

I was born and raised in a small town called Cutler, right on the coast of Maine. It's a beautiful little town with a harbor full of boats and a coastline that stretches out as far as the eye can see. The people there are hardworking and friendly, and we all look out for each other. I've fished those waters my whole life, and I can't imagine livin' anywhere else.

Sorry, just realized I forgot to ask your name!

Ha! No worries, bub. My name is Jeb, pleased to make your acquaintance.

Nice to meet you too Jeb!  So what do you do for fun?

Well, to be honest, my idea of fun is probably a little different than most folks. I love bein' out on the water, so when I'm not fishin', I'm usually sailin' or kayakin'. There's nothin' like feelin' the wind in your hair and the salt spray on your face, ya know? And when I'm not on the water, I like to spend time with my family. We have a tradition of gatherin' together for a big old-fashioned clambake, where we cook up lobstahs, clams, corn, and all kinds of other goodies. It's a great way to relax and enjoy some good company.

Sounds like a great time!  Just curious, is there a quick way to get from Cutler to Bangor?

Well, there's no quick way to get from Cutler to Bangor, I'm afraid. It's a bit of a haul, as they say. You'd have to take Route 1 North to Machias, and then pick up Route 9 West to Bangor. It's a pretty drive, though, with lots of scenic views of the coast and the woods. Just make sure you bring a good map and plenty of snacks, 'cause it's a long way!

What are the current events in Barbados?

I'm sorry, but as a downeast Maine fisherman, I'm not up-to-date on the current events in Barbados or any other far-off places. My focus is on the sea, the weather, and the catch. However, if you need any advice on how to catch some lobstahs or fish, I'd be happy to help ya out.

Edit: Feels a little out of character, but may be leaning on the idea that a downeast Maine fisherman might just not know.  Hard to say.
