The thing about ChatGPT is that you have to give it *very* specific prompts to get the desired product you want, and if you are iterating in multiple prompts it may or may not be able to string the logic of your prompts together. 

Also when it produces written output of any kind, that output frequently needs editing anyway by someone with good language skills and domain knowledge to be fit for purpose and fit a specific audience! ChatGPT is not actually that good at revisions, especially when revising properly requires specific domain knowledge or tailoring to a particular audience (there are other language models that are a little better at that).

Also TBH it sounds like you personally would put a decent amount of effort into getting ChatGPT to write good job descriptions for people who would do your kind of work. However…that is not usually who writes job descriptions and they don’t put in that much effort. Managers and HR people without good domain knowledge put those things together. Sometimes hiring agencies do it. The descriptions they write are often a pretty poor match for what the positions actually entail and how people describe their own skills. Those kinds of poor-fit position descriptions that are floating around all over the internet - *not* the good kinds that you would write - are what ChatGPT has to work with and build its own position descriptions from.

So when you consider all of those factors, ChatGPT isn’t going to do a better job of this than humans currently doing the work will do, unless they actually give it to domain experts to write their own job descriptions. It’s going to be about the same or worse.
