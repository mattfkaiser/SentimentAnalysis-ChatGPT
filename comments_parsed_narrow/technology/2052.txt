Your comment perfectly articulated one of my biggest concerns with tech like ChatGPT, which is that the mental muscles that develop in the course of trying, failing, and learning will atrophy as people become dependent on what is essentially an all-knowing oracle owned by a private corporation.

I'm certainly not against AI in principle, but what does it mean when technology is used by students "going through the motions‚Äù of getting passing grades, when one of the most important skills a higher education can impart is the skill of learning itself?
