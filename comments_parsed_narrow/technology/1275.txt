I think it’s because people don’t see how to integrate this into work and only see it as a replacement for work. As anyone who’s ever taken college level maths knows though, the calculator doesn’t actually solve all the problems. WolframAlpha has been able to do even more than a general calculator but still doesn’t do everything. 

That’s just math, the same exists for every other subject. As someone with ADHD it’s made learning and writing papers much easier on myself. I know everything I want to put down, but it’s difficult to concentrate long enough to do so sometimes. My last paper I used chatGPT to help with and it still took me over two hours to read the material and go through the revision processes with it to complete the paper, and that was over a subject I heavily knew about and still got an 89%.

It’s an accelerator, not a replacer, just like every other technology that’s come along.
