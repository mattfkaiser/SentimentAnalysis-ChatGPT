It's kinda tough to replicate ChatGPT because of the sheer amount of computational power and data needed to train it. Even if all the methodology were open source, which I don't think it is (just the outline of the approach taken). You can already make a chatbot with no guard rails based on GPT2 or a number of models that aim to replicate GPT3 (like GPT-Neo). But making one as good as ChatGPT without access to something like GPT3.5 off hand will be tough.
