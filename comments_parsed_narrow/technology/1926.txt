its WAY more useful than a fresh junior:

\- ChatGPT doesn't ask stupid questions

\- ChatGPT gives you an answer in seconds

\- ChatGPT doesn't pretend to work

\- ChatGPT outputs much cleaner code

\- ChatGPT works 24/7

\- ChatGPT doesn't need to be trained

I've managed around 20 junior developers in my life and none of them were even close to as useful as ChatGPT. Except this one kid named Bruce, Bruce was a fucking machine. if anything, ChatGPT is the ultimate junior. God I love ChatGPT
