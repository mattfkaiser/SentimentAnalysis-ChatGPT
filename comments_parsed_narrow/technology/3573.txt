I still find ChatGPT to be better if you make the right prompts and be specific with what you need. It's also great that you can customize its story contents for every step. Sudowrite still has problems with remembering stuff or identifying people in the context, like all the other storywriting AIs I've tried. The only advantage I had using them over ChatGPT is that they don't censor content.
