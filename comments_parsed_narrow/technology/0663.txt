I think GitHub Copilot is really more of a glimpse into how LLMs can be a game-changing tool than the genetic ChatGPT app.

But that's just it: it's a tool. It doesn't get you the whole way to a finished product and it definitely doesn't get you the expertise needed to adapt and support it for customers and integration into an ecosystem. It can get you 80% of the way there a lot of the time, but the remaining 20% requires a refreshed skill set to identify and effectively execute on.

"80% done" is often enough for good PR and demos, so it doesn't surprise me that non-technical roles are exaggerating like this. Get the shocked Pikachu faces ready for the wave of "unforeseeable technical challenges delaying product rollout" announcements in the next couple of years.

Limitations aside, though, it *is* a game-changer. Just like using a power drill and nail gun can give you faster, more consistent results when you're building something with screws and nails, LLMs are going to dramatically accelerate velocity when used correctly â€” and that multiplier is only going to get bigger, fast. It's all contingent on us adapting and learning to use the tools, though.

As for implications, massively increased productivity implies either faster innovation and development or fewer people needed. Probably a decent chunk of each. We should be very worried about *that* across the entire archetype of knowledge work, but that's its own ball of wax.
