To that point, I’ve had professors requiring students to utilize Google Doc tools (citations, spell-grammar check, etc) which in the realm of applying artificial intelligence to an essay, is kinda ChatGPT’s next door neighbor. Note, having ChatGPT write your entire paper word for word is one thing - obviously not a good idea. But, using it as a tool for sentence structure or synonym tool…I say is fair game 🤷🏻‍♂️
