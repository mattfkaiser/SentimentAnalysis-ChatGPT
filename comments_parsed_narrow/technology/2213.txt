Flawed analogy as most are. A better analogy is Yelp where many restaurants have a star rating and the user can choose to go to a restaurant with a specific rating, or no rating. Versus Zelp which doesn't support any ratings for any restaurants. I can absolutely compare the two, one provides ratings, the other one does not. I can also assume that not all restaurants are great and based on that judge that the system providing ratings is net better because it allows me to avoid the bad restaurants. Conversely Zelp is absolutely worse because it won't help me avoid the restaurant that's a regular source of food poisoning. Yelp helps me avoid diarrhea, whereas Zelp does not. If I were a Zelp user, I'd spend a lot more time in the toilet than if I were a Yelp user. Yelp is StackExchange and Zelp is ChatGPT.
