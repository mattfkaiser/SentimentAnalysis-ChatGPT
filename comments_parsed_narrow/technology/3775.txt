Yeah, because public schools aren't meant to make money


Even ChatGPT understands this:

> Public schools are generally non-profit organizations that are funded by government tax dollars and are not operated with the goal of earning a profit. Instead, their primary goal is to provide educational services to the public, and their funding is allocated towards that purpose, such as hiring teachers, purchasing resources, and maintaining buildings. On the other hand, tech companies are for-profit organizations that aim to generate revenue and increase their profits by providing products and services in exchange for money.
