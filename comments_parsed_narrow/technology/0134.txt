>I've been very impressed by how human-sounding ChatGPT's responses are. But it regularly seems to completely make up "facts", talk about them in an authoritative way, contradict itself and then back down the second you challenge it. So far it seems to be simulating the most annoying person you could possibly work with. 

So they based chatgpt on the average redditor?
