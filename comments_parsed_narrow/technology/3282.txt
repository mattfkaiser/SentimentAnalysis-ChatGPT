Replacing workers? Yeah, no. I don’t think so. Can ChatGPT make and serve your breakfast at Denny’s? Deliver mail or Amazon products? Drive you home from the bar after a night of boozing? Lap dance? Process paychecks? Make your wedding cake? Draft the construction blueprints for a new high rise? Operate on that melanoma on your face? Sew you a new suit? Fly you to grandma’s for the holidays? 

F*ck off Chatshit.
