If someone is dumb enough to type a prompt into ChatGPT and just directly submit it for an assignment, that probably won't be too hard to catch. At least for now. The tricky part will be catching students savvy enough to get the AI written essay and then rewrite it in their own style and fixing any errors.

Though I don't know if Chat GPT is able to cite sources. For a lot of my college essay, we've had to cite academic sources and quote from them. I don't know if ChatGPT has access to academic journals and libraries and is able to also correctly source info. This will probably lead to having to write essays in person in class, or having some requirement that they know the AI can't do.
