One of the current methods for training competing models is to have ChatGPT literally create prompt -> completion data sets. That's what was used for https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI. A model based off of the Llama weights released by facebook, then fine tuned on ChatGPT3.5 prompt + completions. So yes, there is a good chance that google is literally using ChatGPT in the training loop.
