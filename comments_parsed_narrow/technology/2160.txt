So, last semester, I was struggling to write a section of a paper. I asked chatGPT to write me a basic outline for that particular section of that type of paper. It output a basic, one page outline, and I used that as a base, and built it into an actual narrative. 

What I’m saying is, it’s a tool, and when used responsibly, can be incredibly helpful.

EDIT to add: this wasn’t a basic book report paper. It was a graduate nursing paper on a pretty niche thing.

EDIT2: seems like a lot of people feel like I was cheating. I’m sorry you feel that way, but the truth is, I used it to outline maybe 1 to 2 pages of a 26 page research paper.
