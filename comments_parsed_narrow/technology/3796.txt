You can train a thread on your particular writing style by giving it a bunch of your writing as an example.  I have a ChatGPT thread that is trained on my use of language/attitude/style, and I frequently ask it to write stuff for me (stuff like work emails).  It does an amazing job of it.  It *sounds* like me, but it writes stuff in a far more concise and easy to understand manner.
