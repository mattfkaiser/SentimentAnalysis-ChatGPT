And yet every tech boss in the world is forcing their employees to jam ChatGPT into every product. I fully expect the company I work for to shoot itself in the foot because they're determined to cram ChatGPT into a software product that faces the public and deals with some sensitive topics where wrong advice could have very serious consequences. We have tried to warn management that it's just a word prediction engine and not an expert system, but they are hypnotized by the prospect of marketing opportunities and the chance to lay off staff.
