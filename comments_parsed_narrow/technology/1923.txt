I used it to generate a bunch of fake API data last week for testing purposes. Saved me a lot of time and output was perfect.

Lots of people complaining ChatGPT isnâ€™t always accurate but missing the big picture in terms of value, especially as a subject matter expert. Frees up brain space so I can quickly review output rather that come up with something original.
