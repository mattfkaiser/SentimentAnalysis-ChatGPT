No I do not disagree with that.  However, have you read about ChatGPT left leaning bias?  It is things like those that end up creating a shitshow.  Look at Twitter.  Sure, we had a great time when it was flagging all conservatives and shadowbanning them and all.  Now the tables turned and it is actually enforcing right interests.  The pendulum effect.  The difference is that there are people on the right who own the next internet gloal provider and who makes rockets land on their butt.  Sure we can say whatever about Tesla and all, but ultiimately for pushing agendas we may end up being force fed their stuff and there will be nothing we can do about it.  That's why I mentioned neutral would be best.
