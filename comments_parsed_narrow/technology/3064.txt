Honestly I'm using it to understand better concepts in subjects I'm taking at college because I have professors that just read a PowerPoint.

They don't explain the reason behind formulas and sometimes you need a deeper context about why that formula is being used in that context. And let's not talk about the notes they upload to the learning platform because some things don't appear there.

Honestly there are subjects for me like electronics where I really need "dumb" notes to get the whole picture as to why is this and that. 

Hence why I'm using chat gpt from openai because I can ask the most stupidest questions and get good answers.

For me it's a great tool for studying whenever I filter the answers because sometimes the ai gets it wrong too.
