Kinda a false equivalency though. Calculators still largely require you to understand the underlying math to solve the problems. They only aid in the easier parts, which are hopefully we'll established. They speed the process, not solve everything for you.  And they also are easier to prevent usage as they can be banned for testing.   But chatgpt can create an entire essay based on a few word prompts, and requires basically no subject knowledge to use other then evaluating if the answer given makes sense or not. It's also usually not as easy to test on essay skills in a controlled classroom environment, like a math test, because the time required is larger and access to research resources are often necessary.
