People don't seem to understand that ChatGPT is LANGUAGE MODEL. It neither knows stuff nor does it fact check or learn besides how sentences are constructed and sounding logical.

It does not replace own research.

It's great for most basic things. I do use it for skeletons of code as well, because the basic stuff is usually usable but you still need to tweak a lot.
