ChatGPT maybe but generative AI most certainly is not. In my industry anyone who is remotely technical understand how massive an impact generative AI is currently having and more importantly will have in the very near future. My company employs 120 people. I hate to say it but I can see that within 5 years we will have five employees 100% down to what I can build with AI. It's not hype, it's real.
