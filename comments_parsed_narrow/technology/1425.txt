Seriously since the beginning of the ML craze I've spent almost every meeting I am in on this topic trying to talk companies out of wasting money on terrible implementations of nonsensical use cases for this crap. It has only been getting worse and worse with things like chatgpt being so public facing. Now every time I see the letters AI anywhere online it is full of the dumbest comments talking about sentient end of the world crap in the next 5-10 years. It makes me embarrassed to be part of this species.
