There's nothing about ChatGPT that is all that new.  Like I said, the idea was invented [years ago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).  The GPT-3 model that ChatGPT is based on has been open source since 2020.  OpenAI just gave it a flashy and polished UI.  It's no more a paradigm shift than Windows 95 was on the day it was released.
The interesting thing here is that OpenAI clearly took a risk by releasing ChatGPT the way it did.  There are obvious problems with it.  I can be manipulated into making offensive statements.  It confidently proclaims falsehoods, and will repeat them even after presented with contradicting evidence.  However, OpenAI is a relatively small company, so if ChatGPT had completely failed no one would have noticed.  If a bigger company like Facebook or Google released a bot that could be similarly offensive, or made similarly false statements with the same degree of confidence, the tech media would have had a field day with it.
