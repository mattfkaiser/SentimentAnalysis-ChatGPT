I'm not saying we should let Chatgpt do everything, I'm saying we should incorporate it into the existing system. Like for example if you're teaching students about Nazi Germany, you have to go into the details like the ideology, Hitler, genocide, the propaganda the rise of the Nazi party, etc. There's no way to really really getting around that.

The part I don't understand is writing a paper about it because the real life application of that is very niche and unless that's a field that you're interesting in pursuing. But that's more of an education problem rather than a chatgpt thing.

Secondly, your point about chatgpt can only spew out a sixth grade level essay is objectively wrong. It has passed the US Medical licensing exam, MBA exam from the Wharton University of Pennsylvania getting a B-,  Law school exams from the University of Minnesota getting a C-, that's much higher than 6th grade lmao 

Moreover, the more we interact with Chatgpt, the more information it gets, it's going to get way more intelligent and proficient. It will surpass the smartest human minds in less than 10 years time. What we have seen from chatpgt is the tip of the iceberg. In the foreseeable future, AI models much more advanced than chatgpt are going to be solving mathematical problems that professional veterans never thought they could achieve.
