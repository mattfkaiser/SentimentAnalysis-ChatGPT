I am working my masters right now and one of my professors has us USING chatgpt as part of our writing process. We have to submit our work with our papers showing how we are manipulating the AI to write for us. It's like doing math homework where you have to prove how you got to the answer. Now it's proving how we are writing and doing research. Interestingly each of my peers are getting slightly different outcomes based on how we are interacting with it even with work that we are answer the same question with.

Any higher level education will find a way to weed out folks who are not actually learning the information. May get you through your 100-200 level courses and high school papers but for 3-400 level and graduate work you are still going to need to learn the material and be able to defend and explain your thesis's and hypothesis and results.
