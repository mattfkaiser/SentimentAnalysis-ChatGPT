Try this interesting thing with ChatGPT. Ask chatGPT what would happen if you cut the string on a ballon. For fun ask what would happen to the string if you popped the balloon. Then for added crazy ask it to respond in any type of response you want for example like an 7 year old. Or a renaissance era

The tool is real not imaginary. This is actually a big deal
