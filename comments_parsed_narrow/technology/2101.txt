The problem I see with this diagnosis is that there’s unlimited use cases for chatgpt. Nfts as a thing have no real uses. Blockchain has some cool things in terms of contracts and helping people free themselves of gov control, but really, that’s about it. 

Chatgpt on the other hand, literally can do sections of my job (software dev) faster than me in a lot of cases. I’m sure this is true for a lot of office jobs. It gets little things wrong sometimes, but it’s much faster to spot those things and fix them than it is to write entire components with very specific parts in mind. 

I honestly think I’m about 3-5 years a lot of jobs will be heavily integrated with ai. I’m getting on that ship that understands the prompts and where and how to use it asap because i genuinely think it’ll make me a better developer. 

It’s only getting better as well. I 100% buy the hype on this one, and I didn’t invest a single dollar into crypto/nfts/ any of it. Watch the dude write flappy bird without entering a single line of code himself if you don’t believe me
