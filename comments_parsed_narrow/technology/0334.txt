We'll keep seeing posts about how non-chalant and unconcerned people still are regarding job security issues even though every few months this AI dishes out an update that's considerably better than the last. Chat gpt 4 can also process images now so for professions like a pathologist/radiologist whose sole job is the interpretation of said images, I fail to see how chatGPT with access to millions of millions of images in it's repository wouldn't be able to dish out better/more accurate answers than consultants who've had exposure to similar images for their practice but far far fewer in amount. Tell me who's gonna be more error prone and expendable when such a situation arises.
