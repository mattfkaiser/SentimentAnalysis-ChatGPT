I wish the user asked for evidence.

Or knew anything about NTP and asked about where Bing was getting its time.

That said, it seems like Bing is better on the back end. Reads jsut like a redditor arguing a dumb point. Probably better at searching responses on forums or something and sounding human. Chatgpt sounds like a robot in its responses to me
