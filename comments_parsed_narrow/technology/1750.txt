Thats one thing I've come to appreciate about ChatGPT in my time playing with it. Its self awareness that it is still a machine and not a human. Obviously its been programmed to inform people that it's just a computer and not truly self aware but still. I've asked it to write me a diss track for a Runescape god and it told me that while its unable to feel emotions, it has been instructed to keep other beings feelings in mind, fictional or not. Kinda creepy but really cool at the same time.
