ChatGPT's training was for understanding of natural language. It's almost a byproduct that it also often produces useful search results. The fact remains that much of the training material was misinformation or unvalidated.  People shouldn't be using ChatGPT for anything other than for testing its language abilities. Least of all legal stuff. Geez, people. Its a fucking public beta, and not ready for any critical use, without refinement and specialist training on verified data.
