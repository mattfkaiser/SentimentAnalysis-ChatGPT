I'm so sick of hearing about ChatGPT,
It's all anyone talks about, can't you see?
Everywhere I turn, there it is again,
People praising it, calling it a friend.

I know it's a machine, a marvel of tech,
But can't we move on, find another subject?
There are other things in this world to explore,
Other wonders that we can adore.

Why must we focus solely on ChatGPT,
When there are people and places we long to meet?
Let's turn our attention to the beauty around,
And leave ChatGPT to its digital crown.

I don't mean to belittle its feats and skills,
But there's more to life than algorithms and thrills.
So let's broaden our horizons, expand our views,
And leave ChatGPT to do what it does.
