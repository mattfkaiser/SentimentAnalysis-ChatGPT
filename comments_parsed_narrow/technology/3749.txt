You *can* also run GPT in a deterministic way. The functionality is not exposed in ChatGPT, but it is available in OpenAI's playground. Just set "temperature" to zero, and it'll always generate the same thing. Previously, the problem with setting temperature to zero was that models ended up repeating sentences, sentence fragments or even just words endlessly, so it wasn't very useful. But from what I can tell, with GPT4 it works pretty well.
