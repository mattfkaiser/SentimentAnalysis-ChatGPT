It's really concerning to see how new technologies like ChatGPT are being used for academic dishonesty. It's understandable that students may feel a lot of pressure to succeed and might be tempted to cheat, but it's important to remember that the ultimate goal of education is to learn and gain knowledge. Cheating only undermines this goal and can ultimately do more harm than good in the long run. Universities need to be proactive in addressing the issue of cheating and making sure that students understand the importance of academic integrity. It will be interesting to see how institutions adapt and respond to the use of AI in cheating, and how they work to prevent it in the future.
