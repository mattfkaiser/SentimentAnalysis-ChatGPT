Jokes on them. I don't use ChatGPT to write my essays. That's amateur shit.

I feed it the basic information about the subject I'm writing on and it gives me a structure of points to write through in a particular order, and gives me some leads to research more on (considering its database was built off 2018 info, it's not terribly outdated, and serves a sufficient purpose).

When it returns inaccurate information, I correct it and regenerate the response.

I take what it gives me, make it the base of my essay, and then go through and expand each point, matching it with a source I followed up on, ensuring the essay as a whole is cohesive, accurate, and flows well, while cutting down on what otherwise would have been a couple days worth of extra drafting.

It cuts down on the preparation time and overall brainstorming while ensuring I still do the actual writing and sourcing/citations myself.
