We're only weeks to months away from those expensive dating properties using ChatGPT to solicit more and more revenue through subscriptions, by fooling their members that they're actually talking to real people when they're just chatting with a fake AI. 

They've already been using bots and creating thousands of fake profiles every day to bring in more subs, adding ChatGPT/AI to the mix will just increase that even further. 

Note, the top 30 dating sites are all owned by the same company. They all reuse/recycle their fake profiles, pictures and automation to create fake profiles (from Tinder, Hinge, Match, Meetic, OkCupid, Pairs, Plenty Of Fish, Azar, Hakuna, and other brands).
