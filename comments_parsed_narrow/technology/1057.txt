I honestly thought the article was going to talk about the banality of some students' results of these essays instead of the prompts. While there are definitely some talented students, not everyone is a writing genius, and reading over 100 essays a year honestly makes me wish some students would use ChatGPT because it *has* to be better than some of the banal essays we get. If you write an essay and think it sucks, just imagine your professor having to read 10 others just like it in a row.
