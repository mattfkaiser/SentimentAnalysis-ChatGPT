I don't know what to make of that without context. It doesn't follow the usual Haiku 5/7/5 or 17 syllables. I'm not an expert on Haiku , maybe there are acceptable deviations from the form. Given the odd word choice and syllables being off I'd say it feels translated or altered somehow.  

My only other comment is that it feels "dry" in comparison, like the words are sparse if that's the right term. Doesn't beat you over the head with sunsets and heartbeats lol.  Some poetry is not meant to be understood without context which some people like, it's makes it more mysterious maybe. A writer i forget who , wrote that his greatest regret was making his work too opaque , having felt it was a sign of authenticity and intelligence, in essence making the reader work.

 For example : 

*What is a mountain*

*Opportune or obstacle?*

*Raised to thwart me, mama.* 

 It's just silly nonsense i whipped up. Is it deep or shallow? Is it literal or figurative? Who is this mama??  personally I don't care for that kind of thing as it's not communicating anything clearly. But that's my personal bias. 

If this was a chatGPT generated poem i'd love to know the parameters given.
