We need regulation on big Tech.; Amazon is nearly a monopoly on e-book sales.  Amazon's sales benefit primarily Amazon, and authors cannot make a living because the return on their books is too little of earnings.  Authors need protection.  ChatGPT generated books just goes along with this trend of book publishing without editing or review.  Although it has opened doors for authors to self-publish, which is a wonderful option,, it has also lead to a lot of garbage being published on Amazon, particularly on Kindle Unlimited.  I tried Kindle Unlimited for a while, but the books tended to be novella length or poorly written, just quick enough to earn the author a book.  Now ChatGPT submissions will make that worse than ever. 

I'm not against ChatGPT as a tool for writers, but replacing writers is a poor use of it.
