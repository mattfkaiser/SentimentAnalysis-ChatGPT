>Mr. Aumann, who may forgo essays in subsequent semesters, also plans to weave ChatGPT into lessons by asking students to evaluate the chatbotâ€™s responses.


This right fucking here is how it needs to be done. Forego a lot of mindless homework that's just about reproducing what you see in a book and foster actual classroom discussion and debate about a topic. Also yes fucking evaluate the ChatGPT responses because that's the same damn thing. Hats off to this guy whoever he is. (I will look him up later).
