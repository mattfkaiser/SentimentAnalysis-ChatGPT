>“My first thought was: bummer,” Cowell said. “My second thought was: You know what, that’s an awfully long and specific and cumbersome title to have randomly been picked.”

> The book, titled “Automating DevOps with GitLab CI/CD Pipelines,” just like Cowell’s, listed as its author one Marie Karpos, whom Cowell had never heard of.

"Automating DevOps with CI/CD Pipelines" is literally the title of 100s of blogs posts out there. Someone found that Gitlab was missing and wrote one using ChatGPT.

The problem, according to the author, is low quality content in books written by AI rather than authentic human fact-verified content.

No plagiarism is claimed.

> The book’s publisher, a **Mumbai-based education technology firm called inKstall**, listed dozens of books on Amazon on similarly technical topics, each with a different author, an unusual set of disclaimers and **matching five-star Amazon reviews from the same handful of India-based reviewers**. InKstall did not respond to requests for comment.

Unscrupulous Indian scam publisher in the technical training space:

Well, well, well. I'm Indian and I can assure the world that this is going to become a big deal in the near future. Once one Indian is in the news for making a big buck with low effort, a million other Indians will try it without question. Others will try harder and with more crooked tricks to succeed.

I've worked in the SEO/SMM industry here and it is going to get disrupted completely, and in the process, it is going to add a big headache to the world's 
quality and content policing systems. Tools like Grammarly Go are going to be on every Indian SEO employee's computer and we are going to churn out bullshit at never-before rates, empowered by GPT-3/4 .

Search engines better learn how to distinguish and label AI content. It's not going to be easy or pretty.
