Yeah...good luck with that...

For those of you in Rio Linda, who don't get it, you can't *really* regulate shite on the internet without destroying the internet and no one can afford to even seriously damage the internet because the *global economy* is now absolutely permanently dependent on it's continued smooth performance.

Policritters will lie to you that they can "do *something*" to trick you in to maintaining them "in the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed" and to feel "powerful".

But it (AI) is here...it is "growing" and there is absolutely NOTHING anyone can do about it.

Surely you don't think ChatGPT is the only one there is, do you?
