I used it to write an update to my will to add my newest child.  The explanation advised to talk to an attorney prior to signing.  

Overall, it was close enough that it made my conversation with my actual attorney a lot shorter. It was mostly a good guide to what I wanted. Which did lower my billed hours.

This is similar to my software engineering experience. ChatGPT is good at basic principles but needs an expert to organize them into something cohesive that will stand the test of time.
