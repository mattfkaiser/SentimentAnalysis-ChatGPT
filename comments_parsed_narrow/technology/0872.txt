If you’re getting paid by the word to write, your days are numbered.  

If you get paid for the quality of your writing, you probably have little to fear (for now).  

Can we just admit that the vast majority of content produced has no purpose other than to feed Google’s algorithms?   If that’s your job, CharGPT will replace you.   

As someone that grew up before the web (and actually helped create the early web) I can still remember when the only people that got paid to write were generally skilled at it.  

You were writing books, newspaper opinion/editorial pieces, investigative journalism, advertising creative, etc.  The same kinds jobs that will survive ChatGPT.  

All of the jobs that have been created to please algorithms will be done by algorithms.
