Not arguing for or against you, but a thought: why do we have people write essays in school? In early courses, it's a way to learn formal writing structure and prove knowledge of a subject. In later courses/college, you are trying to create new knowledge by taking existing research and analyzing it/making new connections, or writing about a new phenomena that can be researched/analyzed. For the purposes of publishing and discovery, you need the latter, but most essays in education are the former. If ChatGPT can write an article for a scientific journal, that's one thing, but right now it's mainly good at simple essays. It can make a simple philosophical argument or a listicle-esque research paper, but it's not going to generate new knowledge unless it's given in the prompt (e.g. a connection between a paper about child education and a paper about the book publishing industry.) 

All this talk about AI essays and cheating really boils down to "how do we test knowledge acquisition if fakes are easily available?" Fake essay-writers have been in existence for decades, but the barrier to access (number of writers, price per essay, personal academic integrity) has been high - until now. Now that "fake" essay writing is available for free, how do we test students on their abilities? Go the math route and have kids "show their work" instead of using the calculator that can do it instantly? Have kids review AI essays and find ways to improve them? Or come up with something new? I don't have the answer, would love to hear others' opinions...
