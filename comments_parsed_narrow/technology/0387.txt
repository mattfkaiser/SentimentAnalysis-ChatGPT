I think the counter play is that colleges and universities will use is simply more in-person assessments, can't really ask chatGPT to do an exam for you when you're out in the open sitting with dozens or hundreds of students.  Not unusual considering I've taken courses where the only two assessments during a semester is one midterm and one exam.  Or in the case of pandemics, invasive software on personal devices that monitor students through their webcams.
