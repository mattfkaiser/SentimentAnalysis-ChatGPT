I'm not talking about Tay, I'm talking about GPT 1, 2, and 3 based chatbots (and similar). The technology is so well established that there are guides on how to easily make your own. Azure offers these things as a "no code" service. They're implemented as e.g. customer support chatbot interfaces, like on Amazon. However, ChatGPT is significantly different from prior GPT based chatbots, and clearly a lot more powerful.
