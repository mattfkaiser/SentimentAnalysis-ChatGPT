I worried about this a lot last semester. I have now taken some serious development classes and I can say that I am no longer concerned. Chat GPT is pretty good at boiler plate stuff and even finding bugs and what not, but the complexity of larger projects have so many pieces that have to fit together just right. If you asked it to add something to a major project it might even have some good contributions, but those answers might cause problems in other areas. Or very possibly, it might just give you a wrong idea and introduce a bug that could cause a huge failure. The information retrieved has no source and can't be verified (from what I understand) and without this, I would feel uncertain about any advice given on a large scale project. I'm actually more surprised that no one is concerned with the constant plagiarism it's no doubt committing
