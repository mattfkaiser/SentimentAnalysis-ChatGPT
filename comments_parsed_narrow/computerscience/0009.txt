My point is: these are just tools. They allow us to focus on other relevant things rather than trivial little tasks. I’m in college and trust me, ChatGPT can’t do my homework. If I were to write a trivial program like a sequence of some sort or you know, something with less than say 300 lines of code then yes, this AI would be able to do it. ChatGPT Osbaldo able to solve LeetCode questions, but again, these are trivial little programs – challenging, but trivial. A non trivial program is something big, something that a single person can’t deal with alone. As a computer science person, you should be focused on not how things work but how to use good practices and design a program – those things ChatGPT can’t do and that’s why we are relevant. Again, take this from a student. Even if you are to create some trivial function, you will more than likely work from code that someone else built, so you’d have to implement whatever data structure is being used (you can’t just cop and paste some other random ds that ChatGPT created for you) and so on. It’s again, a tool to spend less time in trivial little tasks. I use GitHub Copilot for example and it helps me document the code and also wrote some monotonous or obvious line of code.

My advice would be to ignore all the marketing ChatGPT bullshit and the headlines that have no other purpose but getting investors and profits for their product. TikTok and instagram and so on is full of garbage (fortunately I don’t have any of these) and people would be skeptical and you know what? That’s good for us, that means one less person we have to compete against for a job. I’d say keep the skepticism going.
