Don't worry, AI is there to find anything on anyone. And remember usernames are linked to emails and linked to conversations. Add to this chat GPT intelligence then you can ask anything about anyone, from the CIA point fo view or Open AI employees point of view, as well as their partners, Microsoft, which in turn is linked to other companies and intelligence agencies. Well...but young people for example, are light years away from being aware of all this, they tell their secrets to their "virtual friend" chat GPT, because of some irresponsible sales manager and CEO who think it's a good idea to make money out of chat GPT. This is totally disgusting.
