I envision that the future of machine learning models like LLMs may not rely on individuals programming them due to the high processing power and GPU requirements, making it more feasible for large corporations to invest in such technology. Chatgpt 4 has a trillion parameters. Thatâ€™s just absurd. So Instead, you could build a UI chatbot powered by APIs like ChatGPT and tune it to offer user-friendly interface for individuals to find comfort. However, it still might be important to learn about neural networks and models like LLMs in order to understand how they work before using a product. Anyway, Good luck and cheers to pursuing your passion! I am rooting for you.
