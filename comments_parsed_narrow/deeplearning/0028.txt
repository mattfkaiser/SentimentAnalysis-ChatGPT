I have just installed a 30B Open Source model on a 24GB RAM PC with no GPU ... it's like ChatGPT (to a degree) but runs very slowly.

A GPU would make this run well.

That said, $20 a month for ChatGPT V4 or pay-as-you-go in the Playground is  a bargain.

Question: how much do you spend on coffee, donuts, burgers or booze in a month?
