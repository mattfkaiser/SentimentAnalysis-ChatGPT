This is great for all the philosophical and conceptual conversations I want to have but nobody I know spent a second of their life thinking about it. Also all the changes we will go through due to AI development. 

It’s great to have at least some feedback on those ideas even if it’s super generic. 

At times I give ChatGPT some characters and it helps the conversation advance past the extremely generic GPT answers. 

I’m still very sad that none of the people close to me think about these things, nobody wonders why a Big Bang happens and what differentiates a AIs thought processes from human thought processes.
