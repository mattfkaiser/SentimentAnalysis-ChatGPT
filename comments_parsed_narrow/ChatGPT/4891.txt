Basically, just not to let the ai write your papers. I treat it like Google back in it's early days. I really missed the days when you could do a quick search and get to relevant information without having to dig through ten pages of ads and sponsored content. Chat gpt is great for finding the right information quickly and I love being able to modify the parameters of the request while it's able to work on previous as well as current requests. 

The other day I needed some help with research but Google and bing were just ads. I asked chat gpt and it did ok but I think my request was too broad so I refined it, but I was able to say "Hey let's go back two responses and try this..." or "Ok, let's rewrite the original generated response to include the changes we've made." and it was able to find all the pieces and assemble them in a detailed organized way. I was also even able to get it to help me with some design work I have been having trouble organizing.

The conversational approach also makes it a lot easier to navigate the internet as a blind IT worker. I thought I was going to have to retrain for a different field but this language model really closes a lot of gaps for me.
