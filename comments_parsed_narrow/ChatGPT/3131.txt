Spend at least a week reading posts before making one of your own.

We don't need any new posts about people discovering:

&#x200B;

1. ChatGPT somehow knows the date.
2. ChatGPT can't do arithmetic.
3. ChatGPT's political compass position.
4. That you got caught cheating on your homework but want to find some way to get out of it.
5. You're going to cancel your ChatGPTPlus subscription because it keeps getting nerfed.

Thank you for your attention.
