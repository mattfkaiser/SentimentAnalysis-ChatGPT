Most people just don't realize the power of ChatGPT yet. I highly doubt very many people outside Reddit AI subs fear being replaced just yet. I'm a scientist (ecology), and some of my colleagues hadn't even heard of it. Others hadn't really tried it, but had heard some of the buzz. I gave one of the guys I supervise a demo and he was kind of blown away and plans to start using it. I told my boss, who told my boss's boss, and they're interested in me and another techi-savvy scientist doing some training for our colleagues. So it's all been very well received in my branch of government by my immediate colleagues. I'd recommend you enthusiastically let the cat out of the bag like I have.

My biggest worries are that (1) IT people will get a bug up their ass about information privacy or something and try to shut it down until they can work through the time-consuming process of creating a lame training module or custom neutered model, or (2) some very high-level administrator will hear various negative stories about GPT (people cheating on exams etc) and want to ban its use. So in my mind it's important to prime the high-level people above me to appreciate how much this tool when used properly is boosting the productivity of their scientists. That way if somebody else at a high level gets a bad idea about GPT, there will be a voice in the room to counter them and speak for us.

One caveat: as others said, make sure you're not crossing any HIPAA boundaries etc. I imagine you're in the same boat as I am in my field: even though I'm rarely working with sensitive or private information, the nature of my GPT requests generally doesn't reveal that information. I'm typically describing something like "I have a dataframe with these columns / data types and I want to manipulate it in such-and-such a way," so GPT rarely even has any idea what domain I'm working in, let alone private details. It just helps write the code when I specify my needs properly. In your case this might be another important point to raise within your agency, both so people use it properly and so bosses understand how it's being used.
