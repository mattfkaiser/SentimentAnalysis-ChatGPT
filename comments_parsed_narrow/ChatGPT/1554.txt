Yes, for NDAs and other more serious contracts, I only use ChatGPT for generating a first draft, then I take it to an attorney to save money (they charge more for from-scratch contracts than if they were to just revise a drafted contract)

However, for privacy policy, terms & agreements etc. on my company website, I don't mind using it as it is.
