>My colleague recently remarked that ChatGPT writes better and needs less editing than our interns did. So that's one job already gone right there. 

I mean, yeah? Humans need to be trained too. Not hiring entry level positions because AI can do entry level work is how you kill an industry. 

I’m sure it will get better but of all the prompts and stories I’ve seen on this site, AI still has a very noticeable inhuman style even if you tell it to write in a specific style.
