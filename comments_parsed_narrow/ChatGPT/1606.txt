> 3D games are fundamentally not more complex than 2d games in most cases as engines abstracts that away.

ummmm yeah, okay mate. you sound very credible with these claims.

Recreate The Witcher 3 with your own story/quests?

Don't worry, i know you can't do 0.001% of that. Creating an actual 3d game with physics and complex systems is a pipe dream for now, it can be done with like a trillion prompts but it's probbably a thousand times faster with a human software team.

I'll be waiting on my game though, not interested in boring cookie-cutter super mario games man which have millions of lines of code available on line for chatgpt to re-use
