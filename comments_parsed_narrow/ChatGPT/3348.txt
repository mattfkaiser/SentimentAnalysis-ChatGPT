I'm a senior software engineer who's been working in the industry for 16 plus years.

ChatGPT has probably a 25% success rate on the types of problems I have to deal with. And I have to constantly remind it that the answers its giving me are bullshit.

It's just a stronger Google and a writing tool for people who don't have the brains to write complete sentences with actual punctuation and grammar on their own.
