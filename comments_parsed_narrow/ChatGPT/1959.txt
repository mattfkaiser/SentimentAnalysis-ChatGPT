I’m finding myself using google a lot less than before, but I’ve been aware of the sponsored results and the ever so slowly increasing amount of ads. 
I am using ChatGPT to replace some of what I would’ve used google for, but there are some things that do need to be verifiable.
I have found ChatGPT to be such a great tool! If you need something like a complaint email written or your LinkedIn profile, the results are awesome. And if you ask it to critically analyse a song or a poem it will - I can’t do that with google search.

And this is it in its infancy! So it may not know it doesn’t know at the moment but doesn’t mean it couldn’t.
