Ok trying to assess this legitimately… I think what happened is that ChatGPT took your question legitimately, and not as the answer to the riddle. If I exaggerate ChatGPT’s response to make my point, it might have said:

No, I’m not fire, I’m an AI. Now that you’ve asked if I’m fire or not, would you like to try answering my riddle?
