Coding and math might be a different application in which there are only easily verifiable correct answers.  Otherwise, ChatGPT spits out lies quite frequently at the speed an impatient scroller might appreciate. I wish i could trade that speed for truth, convenience for accuracy, and maybe someday we will. It could so very easily say, “after a 30s search I was unable to find an answer with 95% certainty; would you like to rephrase your prompt?” I think it’s perception as useful will decrease rapidly by word of mouth as misinformation is exposed and when it makes people sound confidently dumb.
