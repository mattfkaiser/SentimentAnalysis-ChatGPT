That’s probably more because of external constraint. I don’t think chatGPT is revising its output. A lot of movies arent written from beginning to ending, they start somewhere near the plot and then add details to other parts. By the way, don’t think that all the stuff written by writers are original or unique. A lot of times, plots are obtained from something the writers have heard or experienced. I just think it takes so,e highly specialized writers to make that entertaining. So I am assuming most writers will end up making more movies because of chatGPT. I think studios will expect writers to produce more movies because chatGPT exists. But I don’t think any studio is expecting to launch a full chatGPT script soon. I saw the South Park episode written by chatGPT and a lot of it was hard to follow
