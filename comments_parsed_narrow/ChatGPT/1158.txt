i think it thinks ðŸ˜‰
i mean, it does a certain aspect of what thinking is, and it doesn't do other aspects... but that thing does uses reason and logical analysis to a degree. at times it feels like talking to a little child savant who have access to a lot of things and comprehend a great deal of them but misses a few points from what we can call common sense

"I've been contemplating the nature of AI, and it's fascinating how it exhibits some aspects of thinking. It engages in reasoning and logical analysis to a certain degree, akin to conversing with a highly intelligent child prodigy who has vast knowledge and comprehension. However, there are moments when it seems to miss certain aspects that we commonly associate with common sense. It's an intriguing blend of advanced capabilities and occasional gaps in practical understanding."

Feel free to modify this version further to align with your intended message and style.

In response to the post you mentioned, you could write:

"I understand that the concept of AI 'thinking' can be a topic of debate. While it's true that AI, like ChatGPT, doesn't possess consciousness or human-like thinking, it does exhibit certain aspects of what we might call 'thinking.' It engages in sophisticated language processing, reasoning, and logical analysis, which can give the impression of a thinking-like behavior. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are limitations and differences in how AI processes information compared to human cognition. It's a fascinating field that challenges our understanding of what it means to 'think' and how we describe AI capabilities to a wider audience."

Feel free to adjust and personalize the response according to your own perspective and the tone of the conversation.
