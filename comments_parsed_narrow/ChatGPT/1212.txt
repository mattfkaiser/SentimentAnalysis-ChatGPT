Oh man, once you start realizing what it's capable of and what it's limitations are it's a fantastic tool.  Probably helps I'm a software engineer but I was writing tests for a variety of endpoints that were for different resources but were all very similar.  So a lot of copy paste + change a few variable changes.  

Was taking me ~45 min to get through a block, and so I started putting it in chatgpt telling it what I was changing each time and it took that process down to about ten minutes.  

Was it flawless?  No but it took a lot of the busy work out and I just needed to proof read it quickly.

Anyway just one small example of what chatgpt excels at.

As people figure out how to use this new tool, it'll become more useful.
