I asked Bing Chat if they had heard about this and what they thought. The reply:

Yes, I have heard about that. Some people are using ChatGPT to generate creative and witty messages for their Tinder matches. I think it’s an interesting way to use AI, but it also raises some ethical questions. For example, should you tell your match that you’re using ChatGPT? How would they feel if they found out? What if they’re using ChatGPT too? How authentic is the conversation then?
