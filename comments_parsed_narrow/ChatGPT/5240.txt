This is fucking ridiculous and only shows how many misconceptions are surrounding ChatGPT. It's a fucking language model, it takes an input and compues a response based on probability. It doesn't "remember" if it wrote something or not. If it was that easy to check texts about whether they were written by AI or not why the guck would there be a whole research field about this topic and why are proper tools for checking this are as bad as having only a 47% success chance? The professor is fucking stupid and the student should sue him and the university. This is just not how ChatGPT fucking works and if the prof does not understand this, he might as well quit his job.

So to answer your question: No. ChatGPT does not remember which texts it has written and it most certainly can't determine whether it wrote something or not. And if you ask it if it did it seemingly just tells you "yes" regardless because that's the answer with the highest orobabiloty of being right by the logic of ChatGPT. So this is not how you check if a text was AI written and you should either try to educate your prof on this or go directly to the university board to report this. And if the Prof tries to pull the same stunt with you, lawyer up and sue the fucker. Oh and also: make sure to document your whole process of writing your essay. Document your sources, make fotos, save several versions of your paper or have a version history. Just so that you can proof that you wrote your paper yourself, just in case it goes to court.
