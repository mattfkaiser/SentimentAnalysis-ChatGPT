Bing Chat reminded me too much of Bard. Too much like a search browser and not enough like an Assistant. 

I'm not using ChatGPT for current events but it definitely helps with thinking through different topics. For example, if I read something and I want to enhance it with additional reading or context, I'll use ChatGPT and can normally understand the topic better. In Bing/Bard's cade, it would tell me to just look it up. Why don't i just look it up in a search engine rather than going through extra step of asking BingChat/Bard to tell me to look it up. 

I figured the service would be better since it's actually powered by GPT.
