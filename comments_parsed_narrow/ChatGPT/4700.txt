People need to understand that if it sometimes doesn't work, they need to try again.  The thing is very random.

Most times tho, they'll simply give up and come here to complain about ChatGPT going to shit and why are they ruining everything my life is over.

EDIT:  Yep, in other thread OP admits it works fine if he just tries again, and yet the comments in here continue to complain.
