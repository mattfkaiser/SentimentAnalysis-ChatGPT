Especially for folks writing proposals grants and reports, ChatGPT is so helpful. I work in higher education and have had it help me outline and update tons of lecture materials, writing prompts , etc. 

I understand students are using it too. Itâ€™s causing me to change the type of questions im using to assess student knowledge. More so it requires them to synthesize and apply information rather than recite facts. It feels like what education should focus on.
