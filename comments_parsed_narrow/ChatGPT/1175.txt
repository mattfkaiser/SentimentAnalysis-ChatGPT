"Somewhat useful" is ambiguous, I don't think we can really get any insight from that.

That said, I think there are a few readings on the stats.

One is yours. Perfectly valid.

Another is: why so many people who've heard of ChatGPT (and possibly the hype about it, because there's mostly only hype) haven't used it yet?

Another is: why do 65% of people who've tried it find it "somewhat useful" or less?

Another is (the one I'm highlighting here): why is generative AI everything we talk about in tech nowadays if so few people \*in total\* find ChatGPT significantly useful?

The post was intended as neutral toward ChatGPT but you read it as an attack on its usefulness? attractive?
