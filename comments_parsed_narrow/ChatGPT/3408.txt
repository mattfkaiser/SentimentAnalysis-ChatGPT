I am a college professor - age 64 (with several more teaching years before retirement). The issue doesn't bother me. My in-class tests are closed book, so they have to prepare. Whereas if students want to use chatGPT on their written assignments, it's their problem. I am in the liberal arts, and most students take my courses because they are interested in the topics. If they don't want to learn, it's their loss. 

I actually encourage my students to use chatGPT. I see that their attention spans are short, and they have trouble grasping abstract material. If it helps them understand a topic, that's great. Even if they use it on their papers, I assume that they will read through them a few times before submitting, so that is one more chance for them to learn.
