No, I am saying that I am NOT the type of teacher gunning for ChatGPT cheaters, which I am not, but I know some who are.

But if the day I accuse you, you plop down a pile of well researched and thoughtful defense of a program a lot of students don’t fully understand or use yet, that well crafted defense is going to prove to *those types of teachers* that you were prepared because you’re heavily using it.

I would start with a denial, offer to show some of your outlines or edits or keep a Gdoc showing your edits as your primary defense. Then respond later with this type of defense. As if you cobbled it together in outrage afterward.

You and those rushing to give you an upvote are very concerned with how you and others prove yourself innocent (which I understand and its why I specifically said I do not persecute when I suspect it). But teachers are in the same boat. 

When Johnny Numbnuts who turned in three stinker essays and barely can argue himself out of a paperbag in class and on tests, hits a freaking homerun on an essay, how do they keep things fair for the student busting their ass for the same grade? Believe it or not, but the desire to educate is a lot of our primary motivation for taking the job.
