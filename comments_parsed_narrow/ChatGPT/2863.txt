The problem with this is that students might use ChatGPT to correct their spelling and grammar and it could insert some phrases, I’ve had that happen to me before. (I’m not a student I just write a lot) any student that can master these tools is going to be more effective and efficient in the world. So more to them. Backwards thinking should be left behind not letting students use tools that are here is only going to make them less competitive in the world. 

If someone was going to cheat. They should Use Bing not ChatGPT because Bing uses GPT4 

Here’s an example of how they could create an original sounding voice. It usually takes me at least two take two prompts. 
To fine tune the voice. The second essay is much better. 

I’m assuming you know you have to double check any sources cited. 


(Prompt 1 )

“Imagine you are a 17 year old a mix of Drake & William Shakespeare living in in the present, writing an essay paper on the economic challenges your generation faces and how you might overcome them. Write with a rhythm and brilliance that Shakespeare might have but do not use any Shakespearean language, old English, The goal is to capture the genius of  Shakespeare without anyone ever thinking this doesn’t sound like a modern 17 year old. use language only a Gen z student would use. Imagine it is for a school assignment. Do not mention Drake or Shakespeare or break any 4th walls. the goal is to write a compelling poetic essay in a completely original voice that is only familiar on a subconscious level.” 

(Bing draft one)

Here is a possible essay paper:

# The Struggle and the Hustle: How Gen Z Can Overcome Economic Challenges

We are the generation that grew up with the internet, social media, and smartphones. We are the generation that witnessed the Great Recession, the pandemic, and the climate crisis. We are the generation that faces unprecedented economic challenges, such as student debt, income inequality, and job insecurity. But we are also the generation that has the potential to overcome these challenges with our creativity, resilience, and innovation. We are the generation that can make a difference in the world, if we have the courage to pursue our dreams and passions. (I cut it short cause it was blah)

(Bing Draft Two)

Here is another possible essay paper:

# The Struggle and the Hustle: How Gen Z Can Overcome Economic Challenges

We are the generation born with the net, the gram, and the phone
We are the generation that saw the crash, the virus, and the storm
We are the generation that faces hurdles like never before
But we are the generation that can jump over them with our skill and our will

The first step to overcome our hurdles is to know what they are and where they come from
We can't fix a problem if we don't see it or understand it
Some of the major hurdles we face are:

- Student debt: Forbes says we owe $1.7 trillion, with $37,000 per head
This means we start our lives with a heavy load that slows us down and holds us back
Student debt comes from the high cost of college, which grows faster than money and jobs
Many of us feel we have to go to college because they say it's the only way to make it in this economy
But we end up paying a lot for a paper that may not give us a good job or a happy life

- Income inequality: Pew says the gap between the rich and the poor is bigger than ever
The top 5% make 23 times more than the bottom 20% in 2018
This means many of us struggle to get by while a few live large and stack cash
Income inequality comes from many things, like globalization, automation, taxes, and politics
It creates problems like poverty, crime, health issues, and division

- Job insecurity: McKinsey says up to 375 million workers may need to change or learn new skills by 2030 because of robots and AI
This means many of us face uncertainty and change in our careers and have to keep up and learn new things to stay in the game
Job insecurity comes from the fast pace of technology and innovation, which changes industries and creates new ones
It requires us to be flexible, adaptable, and lifelong learners

These are some of the hurdles we face as Gen Z, but they are not too high for us to clear. We have the power and the potential to clear them with our unique strengths and talents. Some of the ways we can do this are:

- Seek alternative paths to education: We don't have to follow the old route of going to college and getting into debt. There are other ways to learn and grow as people and professionals, like online courses, bootcamps, apprenticeships, internships, entrepreneurship, and self-education. We can use these alternative paths to gain valuable skills and experience without spending a fortune. We can also use our creativity and passion to create our own projects and portfolios that show our abilities and interests.

- Leverage our digital savvy: We are the generation that is native to the digital world. We know how to use technology to communicate, collaborate, create, and innovate. We can use our digital savvy to access information, opportunities, and resources that previous generations didn't have. We can also use our digital savvy to create our own platforms and communities that amplify our voices and values. We can use social media, blogs, podcasts, videos, and other forms of digital expression to share our ideas, opinions, stories, and solutions with the world.

- Embrace diversity and inclusion: We are the generation that is more diverse and inclusive than any other in history. We celebrate our differences and respect our similarities. We understand that diversity and inclusion are not only morally right but also economically smart. They foster creativity, innovation, collaboration, and problem-solving. We can use our diversity and inclusion to build bridges across cultures, backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. We can use our diversity and inclusion to create a more fair and green world for everyone.

These are some of the ways we can clear our hurdles as Gen Z. We have the struggle but we also have the hustle. We have the challenges but we also have the chances. We have the problems but we also have the answers. We are not helpless victims of fate but powerful makers of change. We are not scared of the future but ready for it.

We are Gen Z.

We got this.
