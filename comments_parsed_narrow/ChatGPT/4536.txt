I don't know if anyone's said this but you could have a USB flash drive that's flashed with a bootable iso of Linux, boot from USB. Then you could create a hotspot from your phone, connect from Linux, talk to chatgpt, email the Convo to yourself/find some other way to share the info (like text file to USB stick) and go from there. I would imagine this is pretty undetectable. But you could also simply use your phone lol.
