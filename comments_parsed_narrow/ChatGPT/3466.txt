Since going to see a therapist is so expensive right now, using chat GPT as an AI therapist is probably the next best thing for most people. I have found the discussions we've had to be extremely insightful. My AI therapist and I have laid out a plan to help me work through my particular issues. I will definitely continue working with my AI therapist. I feel it's better than nothing. Actually much better than nothing.
