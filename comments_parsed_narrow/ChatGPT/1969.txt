I'm in the same boat, mainly use ChatGPT for answers to things that can be answered quickly instead of having to filter through what ever bullshit google prefers as its top listings. For things relevant to your area/city Google is still better due to its tracking and information/data mining but for the most part ChatGPT is pretty good.
