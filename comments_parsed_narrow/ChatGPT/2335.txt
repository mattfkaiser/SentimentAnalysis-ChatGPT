I was just having this conversation with ChatGPT last week. While I have my fair share of friends, we're all still quite young, still figuring out life, and don't know how to tackle deep conversations. Heck, we haven't even had that much life experience to be interesting conversationalists. But with ChatGPT, I can be as awkward in my questioning as I'd like, and it will listen and be informative. It will never substitute the Friday nights I spend in bars with the boys, but it definitely feels like I'm talking to a professor - a library that I can speak with.
