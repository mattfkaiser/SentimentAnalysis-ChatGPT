I'm surprised by the number of people wanting more information on the prompts. I use it for many similar things and it works beautifully. I mention it only because I've been contemplating how this technology will be received by everyday people and it never occurred to me that prompts may not come easily to some users. So there must be people who avoid it altogether. I wonder if there's a way to help people get used to it. Like ChatGPT tutors. That would be a cool job.
