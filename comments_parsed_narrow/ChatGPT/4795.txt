It was a joke so I don’t know if I’d as far as to say they misused it, as from their comment it sounds like they understand the proper definition of gaslighting. 

ChatGPT isn’t trying to get the user to question their reality and think they’re going crazy, it’s just getting confused for whatever reason and not making sense. It isn’t doing it maliciously so it’s not gaslighting the OP
