If like they said this is just using HTML/Javasript & CSS, then yeah it is pretty simple. Animations using CSS can be done in seconds, and the collision detection can be written in Javascript likely in a few minutes.

This may look fancy due to the graphics, but in reaity it's one element infinitely sliding left and right (which you can find countless already written CSS animations for), and a collision on that element. Using Javascript for this type of stuff works as long as you keep it incredibly simple. For a more gamey game you'd need a proper engine like Unity.
