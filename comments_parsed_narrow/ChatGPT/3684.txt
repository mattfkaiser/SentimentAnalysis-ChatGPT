"Yes, psychology is considered a science. It is a social science that uses scientific methods to study human behavior, thoughts, and emotions. Psychologists conduct research using systematic observation, experimentation, and analysis of data to develop theories and test hypotheses. They also use empirical evidence to support their claims and make predictions about human behavior. Therefore, psychology is considered a scientific discipline." by chatgpt (or you think chatgpt is pseudoscience as well?)  
"If you are looking to psychology as solution, don't be too surprised if you don't find what you're looking for." what the fuck does that mean lmao, of course it isn't a solution to every existing problem, nothing is.
