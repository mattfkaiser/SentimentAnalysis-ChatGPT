B.S. I just asked and  this is what I got.    Only time Chat GPT pushed back on a request of mine was when I asked it to write something morally questionable and even then you can change the question.    If you are getting responses about privilege then you need to think about what prompts you are using.    Either that or you're being disingenuous

Here is a recipe for making delicious ice cream sundaes:

Ingredients:

Your favorite flavor of ice cream
Toppings of your choice (e.g. hot fudge, caramel sauce, chopped nuts, sprinkles, whipped cream, cherries, etc.)
Instructions:

Scoop your desired amount of ice cream into a bowl or sundae glass.

Add your preferred toppings, making sure to distribute them evenly across the top of the ice cream.

For a classic hot fudge sundae, heat the hot fudge sauce in the microwave or on the stove until it's warm and pourable. Drizzle the sauce over the ice cream and toppings.

If you like caramel sauce, heat it in the same way as the hot fudge and pour it over the ice cream.

Sprinkle some chopped nuts and/or sprinkles over the top of the ice cream for added crunch and color.

Finally, add a dollop of whipped cream on top and finish with a cherry.

Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious ice cream sundae!

Tip: You can also customize your sundae by using different flavors of ice cream and toppings to suit your taste.
