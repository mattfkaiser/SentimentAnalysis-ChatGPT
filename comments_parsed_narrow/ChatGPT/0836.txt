Same thing happened to me before chatGPT. I googled it and realised what it was. Should've gone to the hospital but decided not to (my legs were in agony, I could barely walk). Drank a whole lot of water to flush my system and fortunately it worked out ok. In retrospect though, I definitely should've gone to the ER to get checked out properly.
