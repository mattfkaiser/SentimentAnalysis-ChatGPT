The thing is, ChatGPT doesn’t “know” anything. It’s a data model using billions of parameters to produce an outcome most suited to the input. It’s not a precise and accurate way of marking work, it’s lazy and ignorant to assume that ChatGPT has this level of functionality yet.

Fuck this professor and fight back if it ever happens to you.
