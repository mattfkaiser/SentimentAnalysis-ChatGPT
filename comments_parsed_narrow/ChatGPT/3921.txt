I really doubt it. A lot of the storylines contain literary elements such as metaphors, references, irony, etc. and the writing isnâ€™t done linearly like the writing chatGPT would output. I am sure writers know this very well and they themselves have likely seen thousands of movies and read just many books. Hence they are bargaining for more money because it is likely that many writers have to integrate  chatGPT to their workflow which may add a lot of complexity
