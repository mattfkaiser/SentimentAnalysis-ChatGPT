Even as someone who uses chatgpt, bard, bing and co-pilot I still find myself googling a lot of stuff, honestly it's almost replaced Reddit for me... Most of my Reddit use historically has been to ask for help with software development / programming stuff because the people on here are a lot nicer than the ones on stack overflow, but LLM's are orders of magnitude more helpful with that stuff.
The stuff you're saying about advertising is on point, but just wait for it.. I'm sure that shit is coming soon, I'd say in the next couple years or so, were going to start seeing it recommending sponsored products (or something equally insidious). A companies success is based on growth, so eventually once they have every paying customer they're likely to get, and they've pushed the price up as much as they can get away with they have to start seeding in mind control bullshit like advertising...otherwise this year's profits will only be the same as last year's profits, which is considered a failure.. Look at Netflix as an example...
