That it’s way too upbeat. My kids ask it to tell them stories. Every story ends with this overwhelming optimism. The kids (7 and 9) picked up on it after a few stories. It’s laid on way too thick. 

There was one time I asked it to tell me a kid’s story, but make the ending sad. It was sadistic. Two friends go walking in the woods. They hear a sound and see a baby bear trapped in a bear trap. They free the bear and the bear runs off happy and free. On the way home, one of the friends trips on a rock and hits their head. The other friend watches as the friend bleeds out. Realizing it’s useless to go for help, the friend just sits there and cries for hours (ChatGPT’s words). Literally, the story is the friend sees their friend die in front of them and just sits there and cries for hours while blood is oozing out of their dead friend. Finally, the friend pulls herself together and gets out of the woods. She spends the next few years in a deep depression before finally pulling herself out of it and moving on. Then we got this super optimistic ending where she realizes her friend would want her to live her life to the fullest and always remember the power of friendship. Luckily, I read the story before reading it to my kids- they would have had nightmares.
