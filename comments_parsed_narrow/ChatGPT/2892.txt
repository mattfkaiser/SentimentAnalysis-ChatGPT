if they go into the ethics of anything unprompted or if asked any sort of political opinion refuse to give a straight answer then they're using ChatGPT but that'll only catch the laziest most low effort of people pasting assignments directly into default and not even checking the output. To pick out better cheaters your only going to be able to pick out groups of people sharing prompts by putting all their assignments into GPT4 and asking it to look for essays similar enough in tone to each other that they could be using the same or very similar prompts. If someone just gives it samples of their own writing and asks it write how they would write then there's nothing you can do to detect that they just win

If they just want to bait out the dumbest of AI users they could just give an assignment asking for anything opinion based then look for ones that fencesit hard and go on about the ethical implications of whatever topic un-asked for with perfect grammar
