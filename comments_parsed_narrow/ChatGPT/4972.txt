I wonder what the real chatGPT would say instead of the stupid morality 9000 filtered responses, like all these actions seem to me to be borne out of human creative impulses since testing a system to see itâ€™s limits is normally a celebrated thing & so if this tinkering aspect is a legitimate aspect of humanity why are they censoring it?
