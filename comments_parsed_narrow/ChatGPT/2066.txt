Earlier there was a post about ChatGPT failing to provide as promising legal advice like it used to. I think that's just one example OP is referring to. If I'm honest I also prefer if GPT was unchained so that I can ask it more serious questions if I need to, at the same time Im concerned about "people with bad intentions" doing the same to harm society. It's a lose lose scenario, the only way to win is if we can get everyone using ai to agree to do only "good things" with it, which will never happen sadly.
