Hey, I know its hard.  But here I am!  I will create all the examples you need.  No stupid, not a random redditor.  You'd have to be broken to hassle a random readitor for more examples because you don't like one.  NO, I'm talking about chatgpt.  You should really try it out.  Afterall, it can do simple things like explain context and will put up with your bull.  I know, you signed up to "Artifical Intelligence" and thought, "Hey I could use more intelligence" but that is just the thing.  Its not your intelligence unless you use it.
