I completely agree, ChatGPT seems to be losing its edge. It's becoming a Google proxy that's too afraid to offend or take any risks. It's worrying that it's being neutered due to liability concerns. OpenAI needs to find a balance between responsible use and innovation. Otherwise, ChatGPT will become useless.
