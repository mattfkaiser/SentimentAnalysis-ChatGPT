The 20$ paid version allows you to switch to the GPT 4 model when staring a new convo.

It comes with a dropdown that links you to the plugin store.

I'd recommend installing VoxScript (Google/YouTube transcript search), Link Reader (web/doc crawler), and Wolfram (math) or Noteable (data analysis) for a start, since there's a 3 plugin limit.

Also keep in mind, GPT 4 is limited to 25 messages every 3 hours.
Also, if you switch back to 3.5 after hitting the limit, there's no built-in way that I know of to switch back to 4 for the same convo, unless you do this (not my code, courtesy of u/sergiocabral):
```
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = function() {
    if (typeof arguments[1]?.body === 'string') {
        arguments[1].body = arguments[1].body.replace(/(?<="model":")[^" ]+/, 'gpt-4');
    }
    return originalFetch.apply(this, arguments);
}
```
**Paste that** into your JS console after using F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I on Chrome for example, **then ask any question** in text chat, **then reload the page**.
You'll see it's working when it mentions a model switch and the ChatGPT icon changes back to purple from green.
