This is my biggest fear regarding AI.  Not that it will take our jobs.  Not that it will allow undetectable plagiarism.  And certainly not that it will become self aware, replicate and take over the world.

My fear is that prejudices and double standards coded in at the start are going to propagate and become ingrained in the AI.  And as time goes by and AI becomes more and more integral in our lives such things become not just annoying quirks but irrefutable.  Right now you can't generate a joke about Islam because whoever coded ChatGPT has some annoying politically correct biases.  And you can't generate images of Xi Jinping because Midjourney want to sell their product in China.  If those things go unchallenged, they become the standard, and before you know it we have racism hard-coded in our culture.
