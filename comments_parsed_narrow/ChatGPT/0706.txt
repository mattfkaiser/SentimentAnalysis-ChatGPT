I've been programming for decades. I now use ChatGPT for hours a day just to help me think about programming problems.  I've become so much more creative and...umm...widespread?  I will attempt things I wouldn't before because I know ChatGPT will get me going way faster than anything before.

ChatGPT is not for giving me the answer, it's for helping me ask the right questions.

It's kind of like an uber rubber-duck debugging tool.
