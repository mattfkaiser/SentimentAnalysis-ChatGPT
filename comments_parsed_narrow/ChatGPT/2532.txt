Instead of not "grasping the concept" have you considered that ChatGPT does not share your absolutist view?

Here are a few examples of successful implementations of universal rights that coexist with individual liberties:

\- Universal healthcare in various European countries. In countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany, access to healthcare is considered a right and is provided by the government. While these systems are not without their flaws, they have generally demonstrated that providing universal healthcare can coexist with individual liberties. People still have the option to choose private healthcare if they prefer, and the existence of a public healthcare system does not inherently restrict their personal freedoms.

\- Social Security in the United States: Social Security, established in 1935, is a federal program that provides financial support to retirees, disabled individuals, and their families. This universal right has not hindered individual liberties, as it does not force people to retire or dictate how they spend their retirement income. Instead, it offers a safety net that ensures a basic standard of living for older citizens and those who are unable to work.

\- Universal suffrage: The right to vote is a cornerstone of democratic societies, and the expansion of suffrage to include all adult citizens, regardless of race, gender, or social class, has been a successful example of providing a universal right without compromising individual liberties. People can choose whether to exercise their right to vote, and the existence of this right has been crucial in empowering citizens and fostering democratic processes.

\- Public libraries: Public libraries provide free access to books, resources, and information for all citizens, promoting education and equal opportunity. This universal right has not restricted individual liberties, as people can choose whether to use these resources or not. Instead, public libraries have become vital community centers that support learning and cultural enrichment.

\- Clean water and sanitation: Access to clean water and sanitation is a basic human right, and its successful implementation in many countries has led to improved public health, reduced child mortality, and increased life expectancy. Providing these essential services does not compromise individual liberties, as people are still free to choose their water sources and sanitation facilities. Instead, it ensures a basic standard of living and promotes social equity.

tldr: Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
