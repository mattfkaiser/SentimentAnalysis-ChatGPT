Just show them the other models.   ChatGPT is underperforming when compared to vicuña, wizard, llama etc.  let’s just say if it is the cellphone era, ChatGPT is a blackberry.

If your company wants to commit to the api it’s their choice, but they lose all the past work and won’t have anyone to help with it if they need to go back and use the ‘old system’.  Meanwhile, you can spend some of your expertise and time in commits or shop around for new employers while you ‘test and troubleshoot comparability with the api’
