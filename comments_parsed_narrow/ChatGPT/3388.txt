This is a generation being raised on hyper-immediate gratification (2 day shipping, 15 second videos, etc.). Kids will just chatgpt their assignments and turn them in without giving a damn about what's on it. My mom works in a school district and gives me stories about how painfully incapable incoming students are. They pay less and less attention, and simply don't care.
