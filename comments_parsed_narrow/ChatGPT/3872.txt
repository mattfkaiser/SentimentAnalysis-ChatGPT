>However, it's important to consider that GPT, at least in its current form up to GPT-4 (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021), does not have a persistent memory. Therefore, it would not be able to remember past "experiments" or outcomes, limiting its ability to learn from these interactions and build up complex chains of reasoning over time.

This seems like it should be easy to program into chatgpt though. The same way that you trained it on its current data set, train it on the new information?
