I suspect the issues around chapgpt include the following possibilities:

Can it do effective brief therapy?
Is its creation of art able to generate that rather rare art fugue in some viewers?
Can it generate new diagnostic Rothschild images?
Can it generate new written psych instruments and understand the responses?
Can it adjust your behavior thru hypnotism?
Using current electronics, can it read your mind with better than 85% accuracy?
Can it brainwash you better than humans?
Can it understand and speak Dolphin?

Some of these are wonderful, but you probably do not get to pick and chose.  My guess is the concerns of some are based on serious evidence of plausibility. There are of course other reasons.

Oh  here in Oregon, you can ingest magic mushrooms in a clinical setting.  Would an a.i. do better as a guide?

So i think you are not going to see davinci chatgpt in many consumer products. But the idea of chatgpt as a therapist is fine, but remember it is like any computer generated solution:  double check it.  And talking to, another human might be a right way to check.
