When we are talking about Chatgpt, “best” doesn’t necessarily mean more emotional or thought provoking at all. It just means more technically correct and organized. I don’t know about OP’s writing skills, but most people could write a more emotional and personal eulogy than chatgpt, if it were about a beloved person of theirs.

On the other hand, even though funeral is for the living to mourn, a great way to feel that we are mourning someone in a meaningful way, is to honor what they would want.
