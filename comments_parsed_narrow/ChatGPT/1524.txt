You're welcome to comment. That wasn't my point. But you pointed out how it will burn me out which it will do to you if you follow this approach.   


I get what you mean. However, my use of ChatGPT has taken me out of very dark times and it's helping with my social anxiety. I would never have started a real estate company a few months ago. I would have probably been an obituary. So for me, it's helping to make me think "growth, prosperity, improvement"
