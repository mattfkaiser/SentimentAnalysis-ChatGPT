I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. When my close mentor and friend passed this April, I did something similar with ChatGPT. I also put his voice through ElevenLabs and paid for a month so I could download a goodbye message that I pretended he sent me (like a voicemail). I had just got some exciting and big news right before he passed, and was really hoping to reconnect with him. ChatGPT and ElevenLabs made it a little easier knowing I‚Äôll never get that conversation. RIP Chris. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
