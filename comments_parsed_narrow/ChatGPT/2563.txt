Certainly! Here's a possible song that has a Frank Sinatra vibe to it, but is original and copyrightable:

Verse 1:
Some day, I'll find a love that's true
Someone who sees me, just like you do
Some day, I'll find a heart that's kind
Someone to cherish, body and mind

Chorus:
Oh some day, my dreams will come alive
And I'll find, a love that will survive
Till then I'll keep on, searching for the one
Who'll make my heart sing, like the rising sun

Verse 2:
Some day, I'll hear the wedding bells
And vow to love, till death do us part
Some day, I'll have a hand to hold
A love to cherish, as we grow old

Chorus:
Oh some day, my dreams will come alive
And I'll find, a love that will survive
Till then I'll keep on, searching for the one
Who'll make my heart sing, like the rising sun

Bridge:
I know I'll find it, some day I will
A love that's true, and makes my heart still
And when I do, I'll never let it go
I'll hold it close, and never let it show

Chorus:
Oh some day, my dreams will come alive
And I'll find, a love that will survive
Till then I'll keep on, searching for the one
Who'll make my heart sing, like the rising sun

Outro:
Some day, I'll find my heart's desire
And I'll know, my heart's on fire
Some day, my dreams will come true
Some day, I'll find a love like you.
