That's the thing, GPT can already do that IF the user knows what they're doing as well and provide the right information. ChatGPT can't go off on its own winning a case by simply asking it to win.

It's a case of garbage in garbage out and it doesn't prevent users from making mistakes like OP did by revealing their hand.

Though if you ask me if ChatGPT should be banned for self representation or legal usage then yes. 100% because ChatGPT explicity states not to share sensitive information as it'll use anything you send it to train itself and everything gets stored.

Though an application that uses the OpenAI API to access GPT would be completely fine in both cases.
