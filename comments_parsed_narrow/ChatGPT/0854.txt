I had Rhabdo recently as well. I had CK 46k - 58k - 59k etc. I ended up at the ER for a day, was transferred to the hospital where I stayed for 2 days and received lots of fluids. Rhabdo is no joke and you need IV fluids to start and to monitor kidney and liver function. You do not need to wait to go to the ER until you have cola-colored urine (for anyone reading this by search, just go to the ER). I didn't have this, but still had blood in my urine. If your muscles are swelling or your soreness gets progressively worse after exercise, then that means something is wrong. My doctor didn't believe me when I told him I had Rhabdo, he said, 'lots of people work out for an hour and don't get it.' 

My rhabo was likely caused by a statin and strenuous weight lifting exercise while I was on it. 

Best of luck in recovering. Go slow when getting back into exercise you need several weeks off and probably more testing to make sure you can exercise safely. I was initially very weak after getting back from the hospital, but have gotten most of my strength back, and hope I can train to build some muscle back in my arms. 

I also asked ChatGPT to verify what I already knew, but no joke to anyone searching Reddit, if you think you have Rhabdo just go to the ER/Hospital. I felt like I was so stupid for going to the ER with sore muscles, but am so glad that I did.
