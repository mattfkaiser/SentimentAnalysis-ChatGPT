I think you need to explain how your work intersects with 'pediatric cancer diagnostics'. For example, if you're talking diagnoses, I'm pretty sure there are probably highly tuned AI diagnostic systems that you're using or could use and aren't something that's a general purpose AI like ChatGPT.  Also, if you're talking about using data have you vetted the results coming out of it? If not, how are you sure you're making objectively 'better' choices as opposed to objectively 'more efficient' choices?
