I've used ChatGPT successfully to complete all my university assignments since half way through this year.

Score remarkably better, undetected, unlikely to be.

I change grammar, order and structure of what ChatGPT writes, and do not prompt it to write the entire essay/report at once.

Not sure if that helps, but only one piece left and the year is complete.
