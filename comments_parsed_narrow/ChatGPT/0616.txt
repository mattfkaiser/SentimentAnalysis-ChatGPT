I build a chrome extension to export all your ChatGPT conversation to Clipboard/Images/PDF/Notion.

Here is it: [Save ChatGPT Conversation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-chatgpt-conversation/bpmjglijpclggdnlpdbpglnadibmlaek) .

We are committed to ensuring user privacy and security, so all conversation records are saved on the user's local device and not uploaded to any servers.

Hope you like it.
