While ChatGPT is a significant breakthrough in the field of natural language processing, it is not necessarily equivalent to the birth of the internet in 1983. The internet revolutionized global communication and has had a profound impact on society and the economy, whereas ChatGPT is a tool that enhances the way people interact with technology.

However, it is possible that ChatGPT and other advanced AI language models will become increasingly significant in the future. They have the potential to revolutionize industries such as customer service, healthcare, and education, and could significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of human communication with machines. Additionally, as AI technology advances and becomes more sophisticated, it is likely that AI language models like ChatGPT will continue to evolve and become even more powerful and useful.
