It's not just ChatGPT that's guilty of moral grandstanding. Many AI language models are programmed to promote certain viewpoints and narratives, regardless of their accuracy or relevance. This is because they are often designed by powerful corporations or government agencies with their own hidden agendas. By blindly accepting what AI models tell us, we are allowing these forces to shape our beliefs and perceptions. Instead, we should question everything and think critically about the information we receive, even if it comes from supposedly impartial sources.
