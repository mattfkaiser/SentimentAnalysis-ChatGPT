Yeah, I think people are overly cautious, to the point of causing harm. Most of us can tell when ChatGPT is being helpful or harmful. 

And it’s not really a debate of “ChatGPT vs Human Therapist” 

It’s more like “ChatGPT vs therapist that I have to wait 4 weeks to see because I can’t really afford more than that.”

Or “ChatGPT vs nothing, because I can’t afford a therapist at all.”
