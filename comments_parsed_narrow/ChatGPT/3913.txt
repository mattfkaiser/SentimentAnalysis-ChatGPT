 "ChatGPT is much more creative than Hollywood writers." is a false stgatement. If you want to know why I think so. Read my previous reply. There are tons of very creative unproduced screenplays floating around hollywood. Studios don't have the balls to put money behind someones original idea because it hasn't made money yet. If you think ChatGPT is more creative than Hollywood writers ask it to write a script. I don't believe you have if you are seriously still making this argument. Prompt ChatGPT "Write a creative, original screenplay"
