I think if you prompted it better, it could help more. Like maybe ask it not to make those sort of obvious responses and to try to actually help the situation. GPT4 would be a lot better at it, if you're willing to pay the 20 dollars. I saw a post of a guy who used chatgpt for therapy and it drastically improved his life.
