I just ran a press release I created with ChatGPT last week back in to the system and asked if it was generated by ChatGPT. It's reply: "No, as an AI language model, I did not generate the press release."  
Note that opening about being an AI language model. It is denying it wrote the press release because it thinks I would look down on such a thing? In the case of a student essay, might it answer in the affirmative because it is trying to to confirm my expectation that it was probably generated by ChatGPT? In any event, the AI is lying in this case, which suggests this is not a reliable method for checking for AI involvement in text..
