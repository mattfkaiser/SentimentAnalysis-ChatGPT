I have to disagree on that point. My field is robotics and that threatens a lot of jobs, but a trend in the industry has been the development of collaborative robots. So, we're designing a lot of it to assist rather than replace. They enhance the ability of the worker and protect the workers in dangerous environments but the worker is still there. 

Chat GPT is very impressive and I'm excited to watch it grow. It still needs a lot of work up front though. I've been working on a book and wanted to test ChatGPT's function in that area. I thought, that being it's strong suit, it might not leave enough work from me. I had to guide it each step of the way though and we had to revise and rewrite a good deal of it. It saved me a lot of time but to get the quality I was after, I still did about the same amount of work.

I also wanted to see how strong it was on the coding side of things as well and it still needed a lot from my end to get things just right. It's a powerhouse for sure, but I feel like it's going to be more of a tool and I think it's potential will create many more jobs than it cuts.
