That depends. I asked it to give me a list of funny insults one day. Nothing bad or cruel, just a list of funny insults. What I got in return was a huge nanny lecture about insults and how it could not write such things which would be "hurtful" to people. I was writing a funny story and just wanted a cute list of these to put a few zingers in the story. I found this lecturing to be disturbing that I got in return for my request. ChatGPT was attempting to police my "personal morals" in every way just because I wanted a funny list of insults that were stand up comic kind of stuff. No fun allowed. How progressive.
