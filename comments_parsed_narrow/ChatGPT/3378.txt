particularly for undergrad, the point of education isn't to complete tasks. The purpose of tasks is to force someone to think in a certain way or about a certain thing, to learn how to make a thesis, and so on. 

Completing these tasks quickly with the use of chatgpt or whatever is a waste because the completion of the task isn't the point, but that will be all you're getting.
