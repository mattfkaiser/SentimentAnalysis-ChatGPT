It responded to the question, it just didn't process it as an answer to the riddle. It's the old "Hu's on first" ambiguity.

E.g. I just did this:

P: Create a riddle where the answer is "serious"

ChatGPT:

I can make you somber or grave,

I can make you focused and brave.

When you need to buckle down,

I'm the attitude that you'll crown.

What am I?

P: are you serious

ChatGPT:

As an AI language model, I don't have emotions in the same way humans do, so I don't experience a sense of seriousness or lack thereof. However, I am designed to provide helpful and informative responses to your questions to the best of my abilities. If you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, please don't hesitate to ask!

P: Is the answer to the riddle "serious?"

ChatGPT: 
Yes, you are correct! The answer to the riddle is "serious." Well done!
