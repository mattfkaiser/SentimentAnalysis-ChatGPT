>The dumb thing is, I use it to help generate inspiration for essay questions, grading rubrics, and even course outlines which I compare to mine to see if I missed anything important. I know I’m not cheating cuz I don’t copy-paste ChatGPT content, and I’m the subject-matter expert so I can easily spot false stuff, but I do some of the stuff that, as a student, I wouldn’t recommend.

I'm also a lecturer (social sciences in the UK). My position at the moment is that I can use it in basically any way I like to help me with teaching (generating resources, cutting down workload, coming up with essay questions, etc.) because *I'm not being assessed*. It's not cheating for us in the same way using a PowerPoint or assessment designed by and shared by a colleague isn't cheating. I also don't copy-paste from it (I've barely used it for work so far at all, tbf), but I absolutely maintain the right to if I find it useful. As you say here, we have the knowledge to spot the mistakes and the discipline-specific skills to adapt anything ChatGPT might generate into an appropriate format and structure, and we have already been tested to demonstrate that. I'm qualified to make decisions about what I use as a teaching resource. I've already earned that privilege. By definition, our students are still in the process of proving they can be trusted with those sorts of decisions, and until they are qualified, they are expected to use, or avoid, any resource or tool we instruct them to. 

We also, after years of education, have a much better grasp of academic integrity and so are going to be better at judging appropriate and ethical uses. For example, while I'd be perfectly comfortable using it as a tool to help me structure and develop learning and assessment resources, I'd be very wary about using it for writing actual research that contributes to the field. I wouldn't publish with a lit review heavily constructed by ChatGPT, for example. I do wonder if this sort of thing will become more acceptable in the future, though. 

Anyway, there is a huge difference between using this tech as a resource to become more efficient at work (which ultimately benefits our students) and using it to gain a qualification that verifies knowledge and skills (which, depending on the discipline, could result in someone dead). My general attitude when speaking with students about this is that they have to first show they can do the work without that crutch. Once that's done, crack on... it seems to be shaping into marvellous technology that will change the world, but it's potentially dangerous in the hands of technically qualified graduates who are unable to function without it.
