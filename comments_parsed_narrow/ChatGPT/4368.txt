Feel free to use it to translate something into your own language if you just want to get a quick gist. But don't expect ChatGPT to translate anything important into other languages with any sense of idiomaticity or competence.

>Me: Translate to Esperanto: “As they were driving back from a weekend getaway, John felt a strange pain in his chest.”  
>  
>ChatGPT: Dum ili revenis hejmen el weekenda eskapado, John sentis strangan doloron en sia brusto.  
>  
>Me: Is “weekenda” really an Esperanto word?  
>  
>ChatGPT: “Weekenda” is not a common Esperanto word, as it is a loanword from English. The more common Esperanto word for “weekend” is “fino de semajno” or “semajnfino”. However, since Esperanto is an international language and has a flexible structure, it is acceptable to use loanwords in certain contexts where the meaning may not be immediately clear or where the use of the Esperanto equivalent may be impractical.

"Weekenda" is completely made up - there is no W in the Esperanto alphabet. Ah the joys of hallucination! And semajnfino is sufficiently common that it doesn't need to use a loanword.

And when it does at least use correct vocabulary, the sentence structure is very much "Englishy"

A satisfactory translation would have been: "Revenante hejmen post semajnfina ferio".  

So what? Esperanto is a minority language. But my point still stands. If you're not a competent French speaker, how would you know if ChatGPT is or isn't doing the same things in your French translations?

Use it as a helper, never as a language tutor or translator replacement.

Bonus fact: In Esperanto culture, the expression "it's all Greek to me" is "Ĝi estas por mi volapukaĵo". Greek is replaced with Volapük, an older failed constructed language. :)
