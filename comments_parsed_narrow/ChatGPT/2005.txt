Wrong, literally tested by asking the same questions for a few particular exams, topics over again. There are some things it can do and hasn’t changed much on. There are so many use cases for chatGPT that even if it has been working perfectly for you it doesn’t mean other people using it for different things and different use case haven’t had a change in experience. 

In my case, when it comes to topics in the insurance industry where things are not always black and white it does need some help. Don’t even get me started on problems that I combine math and insurance and how deductibles, margin clauses, etc apply. In fact, I have some basic problems I can feed it right now that you don’t need a calculator for that it will just get wrong.
