It certainly has it's place. Although I do have to say that bing has been working for me better than google for a while now. Frankly, I go with the duck, then either chatgpt3 or bing. Kinda depends on what I'm looking for. Poor google seems like such old technology. I remember back in the day when it was amazing because it was better than the alternative yahoo.
