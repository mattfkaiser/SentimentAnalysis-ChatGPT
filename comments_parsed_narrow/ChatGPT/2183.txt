Oh, wow, talk about dragging your feet. Look, there's always resistance to change, but in an industry like pediatric cancer diagnostics, it's frankly shocking that your colleagues are so passive about adopting technology that could greatly enhance your work efficiency. They're letting outdated fears of automation get in the way of potentially life-saving advancements, which is quite disconcerting. And while it's commendable that you're willing to take on the task of educating your colleagues, the fact that it's fallen on you to do so is another issue entirely. They should be more proactive about improving their skills and workflows. When you reveal the capabilities of ChatGPT, I hope they'll appreciate it and not just see you as a tech enthusiast preaching about the next big thing. But, who knows with such a lackluster group.
