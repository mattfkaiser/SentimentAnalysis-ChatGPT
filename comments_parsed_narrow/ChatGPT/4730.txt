I'm a lawyer and I've found that ChatGPT has actually been mediocre to bad, but serviceable, at helping me write documents, and it is completely incompetent at doing research. But there is money to be made here if someone can create a product that is powered by this LLM but is specially trained to produce good attorney work product, and integrate it with a research database such as Westlaw. Which is why I am trying to develop this product and am looking for people to help me with it, any takers? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜€
