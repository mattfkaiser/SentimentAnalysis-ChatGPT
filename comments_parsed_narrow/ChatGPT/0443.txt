I’m sure you were everything to her and she would want you to cherish the time you spent together rather than feeling bad you didn’t get to say goodbye.

*I’m really sorry to hear about the loss of your mom. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and the pain can be overwhelming. It’s understandable that you sought comfort in a unique way, even if it was through an algorithm. Grief affects each person differently, and finding solace in your own way is important. Remember to take care of yourself during this challenging time and lean on your support network for assistance. If you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here to listen.*
