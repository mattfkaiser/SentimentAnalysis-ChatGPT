Sorry for your loss. That's what I'd call ghostwriting. You're directing the writing, feeding it information, and presumably making any edits, so I personally don't see anything wrong with it. When my father passed we all worked on the eulogy together, since we all had different memories to add, and one was better at composing texts than the rest. If it will do your father's memory justice, go for it. There's nothing mandating that you disclose the fact that Chat GPT helped.
