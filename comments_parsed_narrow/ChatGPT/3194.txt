You're interpreting the metaphor too literally, which leads to a misunderstanding of the concept.

A bicycle helps you get to your destination faster, but you're still relying on your own power to reach it. In the same way, a computer gathers and organizes information into manageable chunks for you to analyze. You still search for relevant patterns within the data, as you would in your daily life, but now it's presented more efficiently, speeding up the process.

A motorcycle, on the other hand, gets you where you want to go faster and without depending on your own power. Similarly, ChatGPT sifts through information, identifies its relevance, and performs mentally demanding routine tasks to achieve specific, predetermined goals. You don't have to codeâ€”ChatGPT can do it. You just need to understand what coding can reasonably achieve and articulate your intentions.

Have you ever played Factorio? In the early game, you place assemblers and lay conveyor belts entirely by hand. But then you research drones and drone platforms, and suddenly you're working off blueprints. Your thought process shifts to something like, "I need more green circuit boards, so I'll duplicate the existing green circuit board factory to save time."

Humanity has essentially invented intellectual modularity. It's a complete game-changer.
