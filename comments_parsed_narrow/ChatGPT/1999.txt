Agreed. I guess it is human nature to ridicule everything. I find it funny how people can argue over which search engine they feel is superior and yet critique ChatGPT and like tools as inadequate and antiquated. People donâ€™t like it, but the tool is only limited to the skill and imagination of the user. It is a true description of user error.
