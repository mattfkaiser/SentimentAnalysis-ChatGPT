I get it.  And I have used the technology a lot.  I just know that I can write much better than it can.  It's possible that it could be better at writing eventually, but it is very formulaic and generic in its answers.  It reads like AI.  Also, when I write a cover letter, I add lots of personal details.  I am sure you could feed those details to ChatGPT but at that point, you might as well just write your own 3 paragraphs.
