ChatGPT is great as a tool and a toy but it is very difficult to make something that is both original and relevant with it , Hopefully they are just being hyped and don't understand what they are doing, Ai is such a wonderful thing but removing humanity from art is dumb.

This is a stupid idea from a consumer, humanist, artist-enjoyer stand-point but smart from a soulless corporation stand-point

Writers are always adapting to the times , Using new tech like ChatGPT to assist them so they can have more time thinking deeply into things that will make there work great, If the profesionals are all replaced by ai then the ai would have nothing to learn from so the ai would not be able to copy the adaptations the writers made due to the changing of times, Like sure companies could modify there ai to follow trends and what is currently popular but the ai would always go by the programming instead of making risks

&#x200B;

The ai would always follow the politics of the company it is for instead of letting a writer put there own philosophy and politics into it (Shows like The Owl House wouldn't exist if it was made by an ai that justs wants to listen to disney executives, There would be no gay-demon show for teens about some strange kid getting isekai'd to Hell so she can beat up a delusional religious fascist who wants genocide and that'd be a huge loss for humanity. . . Also from the other side of politics there wouldn't be great shows like Ben10 because they would be seen as too traditional to be popular since there is no writer to fight for there show, Ben10 ultimate alien force is my favourite show in existance despite Kevin's annoying takes on women because as much as I disagree with him it made him feel like an actual unfiltered person with his own dumb opinions and there will be no shows like South Park that insult everyone from every political stand-point)

&#x200B;

I am sure people will still try to watch human-made shows even if  hypothetically there is a nearish future where human-made shows are objectively worse because it is inherantly cool that a human thought up all the concepts, If big corporations replace writers with ai then indie writers that are ai-assisted will have an advantage by having there own creative mind instead of a pseudo-creative ai

&#x200B;

There needs to be some actual human-thought behind media from unique individuals instead of hyper-advanced predictive text because as advanced as ChatGPT is getting I don't think it will be able to bring in minut details and then callback to them two seasons later

Although If chatGPT rewrote books for movies that'd be grand since the artist still gets payed, Like if there was a All Tomorrows movie then it'd be impossible to just turn it into a movie without changing anything since it would not fit a movie style, You can ask ChatGPT to write All Tomorrows in the style of a nature documentary and then use ChatGPT's edit as a base for the movie
