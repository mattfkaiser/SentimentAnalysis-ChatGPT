Can we have an intelligent exchange here. Using a separate “cutting-edge” tool to refine a potential result from potentially multiple sources is significantly different from using a traditional search engine by “hand” then sorting the information gained much slower by comparison to a tool doing so. Yes the difference here is that a currently still releasing tool is being used but that’s still a huge difference that can’t just be dismissed as “Using a traditional search engine through ChatGPT is still using a traditional search engine.”
Also do you think that ChatGPT can only be used through a single source google??
