I have when I’m desperate, it’s given me some lines that my therapist has said (just some common knowledge for anyone with emotional maturity tbh) but it’s nothing compared to the real deal. My therapist is really good though so idk 

I think the biggest flaw for the mental health support is that gpt refuses to the play the part. It’ll always recommend you to talk to a professional, say generic things, and. Remind you ten times over its an AI and doesn’t actually think!!! (I know!!)
I know you can try and circumvent all that but it would be pretty useless therapy if half of the sessions is spent trying to convince your therapist to act like a therapist lol. 

I think the therapist you got is just bad. The hardest part of therapy in my opinion is finding the therapist. It took me fifteen different professionals before I landed on the right one for me, who has lasted me six years and counting! 


Chat gpt is as good for mental healthcare as any self betterment book.
