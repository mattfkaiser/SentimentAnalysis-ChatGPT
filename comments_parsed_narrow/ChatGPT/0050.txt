What an interesting coincidence that only a few days ago you commented this on a post asking whether Chat GPT plagiarism checkers can be bypassed:

"fella in my roommates business class got pulled into his lecturers office and because he couldn’t recite the info she failed him immediately, i’ve heard of it happening a few times now but not to anyone i know directly. Our university sent out an email explaining that they’re using TurnItIns detection software but it’s supposedly bullshit, im just waiting for the university to fail someone who actually did the work and watch them get sued because i think that’s the only way they’ll realize it’s faulty as shit."
