I don't know if it's helpful for other issues, but ChatGPT is a horrible OCD therapist. You can regenerate its responses and get conflicting results (most of which are vague anyway), so it's a terrible judge or advisor. Additionally, when you ask questions about morality during a moral crisis, ChatGPT's strict, simple, liability-oriented sense of morality is dangerous. It's true that a lot of human therapists aren't any better, though. It's also totally possible that better prompting could get better results, but I just don't think it's trustworthy enough anyway.
