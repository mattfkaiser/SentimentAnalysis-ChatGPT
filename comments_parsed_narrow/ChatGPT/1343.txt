But in this case you're just referring to using language properly which is equally true when talking to other people (as proven by the fact that I and others didn't realize what you originally meant and why ChatGPT was wrong). Of course even with language models if you type in gibberish or tell it to do something other than what you want then it isn't going to reply how you'd like. That's not the point the original commenter was making though, his point was that it was possible to be more vague or loose with language while still getting good answers.
