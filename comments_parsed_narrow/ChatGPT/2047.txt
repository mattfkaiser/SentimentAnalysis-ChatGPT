I have serious doubts about that, people aren’t realizing the massive amount of money they are burning to train and run these models.  I give them a couple years to try to reach break even or investors will lose interest and write them off.  LLMs are just an exercise of throwing a shit ton of data and computer power at something and hoping it makes something useful.  

Don’t get me wrong, it’s interesting, but after the excitement settles they need to make money to stay operational.  I highly suspect the only reason they made chatgpt public when they did was be they were out of money and needed to demonstrate its potential so MS would throw a bunch of money their way, which they achieved.  $20 a
 month subscriptions are not going to cover their opex.
