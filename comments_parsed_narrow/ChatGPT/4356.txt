ChatGPT 4.0 does seem to get the Russian idiom someone mentioned correct. It also improves the German translation.

Finally, someone said that in Spanish we say "it's mandarin to me". While I've heard that, it's definitely a regional thing, where I am from we only say "This is in chinese!" (esto está en chino!).

    Spanish: "Todo me suena a chino."
    French: "C'est du chinois pour moi."
    German: "Das ist für mich böhmische Dörfer."
    Russian: "Это для меня китайская грамота." (Eto dlya menya kitayskaya gramota.)
    Arabic: "هذا كله كالصينية بالنسبة لي." (Hatha kulluh kalSiniya bilnisba li.)
    Mandarin Chinese: "这对我来说就像天书." (Zhè duì wǒ lái shuō jiù xiàng tiānshū.)
    Hindi: "यह मेरे लिए सब ग्रीक है।" (Yeh mere liye sab Greek hai.)
    Japanese: "これは私にとって全てがギリシャ語のようです。" (Kore wa watashi ni totte subete ga girishago no you desu.)
    Greek: "Είναι όλα κινέζικα για μένα." (Eínai óla kinézika gia ména.)
    
    The phrase "It's all Greek to me" is an idiom that means something is difficult to understand. 
    Each language has a similar phrase, but the specific language used in the phrase can vary. 
    For example, in English we say "It's all Greek to me," but in Spanish and French, the phrase is "It's all Chinese to me." 
    In German, the phrase is "It's all Bohemian villages to me." These different phrases reflect cultural differences in what is considered difficult or foreign.
