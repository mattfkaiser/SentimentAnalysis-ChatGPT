If you genuinely consider it “impossible” to ascertain that GPT was implemented to assist in the composition of an essay, I doubt you have used it in any extensive capacity. ChatGPT is very repetitive and even mundane in the way it structures and establishes its responses. 
  
If you ask it for nuance on a subject, especially a controversial one, 40% or more of the response to your prompt will be some form of disclaimer or contextual footnote that has already been stated multiple times before in a conversation. It also struggles to hone in on a single topic of an otherwise multifaceted issue. It is pretty much the antithesis of a nuanced intellectual. It makes every effort possible to be as general and all-encompassing as possible, even if you repeatedly ask it not to be. 
  
 Now I’m sure you can be clever with the prompts to get it to word its responses differently and make unconventional statements to try and humanize it, but you’re not going to berth an entire college-level essay from that, at least of which a professor with one iota of attention to detail would overlook
