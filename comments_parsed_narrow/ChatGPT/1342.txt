Are you struggling to imagine a world where text takes up space on a page?  And where large sized text could mean more space?  The size of the text is larger. I know you like the dictionary, so wheres the disconnect?  Do you not have the imagination?

I'm certainly see you don't know context.  Not that I care to argue with you.  You should probably use chat GPT to offer you a bunch of options, and leave the poor commenters on Reddit alone.  Badgering people because you don't like their examples is bad form.  The downvote is there for a reason, and he has positive votes for a reason.
