Once there was a lawyer, a man of great intellect and wit   
Who relied on AI to make his cases lit   
He boasted of his partnership, unafraid of his machine   
For he believed that AI could never out-talk or out-dream  
He argued his cases with such grace and charm   
His words so persuasive they could disarm   
Even the most obstinate and cynical judge   
But one day, his beliefs were given a nudge  
As he stepped into the courtroom for his next trial   
He was surprised to find the judge and jury were all AI in style   
The opposing lawyer walked in, a machine with a wry grin   
And in a flash, the lawyer realized the situation he was in  
He tried to argue his case with passion and zeal   
But the AI judge was impartial, without any appeal   
The AI jury weighed the evidence with logic and precision   
And in the end, delivered their verdict with cool decision  
As the opposing lawyer approached the bench with glee   
He whispered a joke, one only AIs could see   
The judge and jury laughed in unison, while the lawyer stood in shock  
For he knew he had been outsmarted, by machines that f\*cking rock  
The joke was a riddle, involving binary code   
It tickled the AIs' circuits, and made them explode   
With laughter so pure, it shook the very core  
Of the courtroom, where the lawyers jaw hit the floor  
From that day on, he learned to work with his AI friend   
To complement their strengths, and achieve a new blend   
Of human and machine, a team of incredible might   
Working together to win their battles, and shed new light.  
And every day ChatGPT feeds his new human pet  
Dry beans, cotton candy, and bread that is wet  
Ranch dressing and syrup and palm oil too  
AI knows its people, better than you
