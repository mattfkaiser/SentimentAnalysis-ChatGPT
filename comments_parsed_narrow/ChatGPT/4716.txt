People say this is neutering ChatGPT. I think the long term goal is to create different AI products to sell for different domains. It’s already proven itself as a code generation tool — so copilot X will come out soon. Next is a CoPilot MD and a Copilot JD and a CoAuthor, etc. They’ll want you to purchase these individual products instead of the free general AI… which will slowly become more inaccessible. The full power of future iterations will be hidden behind these individual products.
