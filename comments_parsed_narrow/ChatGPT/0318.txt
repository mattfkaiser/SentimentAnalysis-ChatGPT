i imagine in the near future where people will go on romantic dates, and sitting at a table, they will both talk to the chatGPT on duty first, asking what to say to the other person. obviously miniaturised through an earpiece in the ear.

Who knows what kind of talk.

will talking between people also become 'obsolete'?
