I google searched...

"movie about city of aliens with one guy in charge of city who turns into alien"

District 9 was the first result. I do this quite a lot, and for music too and Google is surprisingly good at it, I imagine they have tailored their search engine results for this specific use case.

This is actually one thing that Google is better at than ChatGPT imo.
