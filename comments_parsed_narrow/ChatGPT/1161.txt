Since I successfully navigated 45 years of life without GPT, I would simply reflect on the tools and methods I formerly used. Believe me, I can rewrite something to sound more professional and polite, it just takes me hours, whereas GPT does it in seconds. (I also proofread everything ChatGPT produces, because I'm a perfectionist Grammar Nazi.)
