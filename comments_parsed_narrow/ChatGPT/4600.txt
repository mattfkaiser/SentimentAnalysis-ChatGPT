I used it just recently to help me make a dungeon. I had written a backstory and had some other context of the Boss of the dungeon. It was a lich who had been defeated by the PCs in another location, but he revived at his main base. I hadn't come up with the main base dungeon at that point. So, I fed ChatGPT the backstory of the lich, the adventure so far in relation to the lich. Then I asked it to make a 10 room dungeon, included a few room types that I knew I wanted, asked it to populate with monsters, traps, and items, and include at least one NPC to save.  


It worked great. I further asked it to make a map of the dungeon. It said it couldn't draw stuff but it wrote out how the rooms might be connected. I also asked it to make a few more NPCs for it, and a few more rooms. Overall, it's a good way to get started. You might need to rewrite half of it, but that's still a lot of time saved, and it can kickstart your imagination, especially if you run a lot of homebrew stuff. Sometimes, you just have writers block.
