If I asked someone to read at my funeral and they told me they were going to use AI to write it, I'd tell them to forget doing it at all. 

However, I may be in a similar situation with my dad in the not too distant future and using chatgpt, even as a basis of the eulogy that I'd customize for him, seems like a great idea. 

I guess I'd say go for it but I certainly wouldn't tell anyone.
