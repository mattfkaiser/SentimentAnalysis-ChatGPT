- [It happened to me today...I literally lost my biggest and best client to ChatGPT today. This client is my main source of income, he’s a marketer who outsources the majority of his copy and content writing to me. Today he emailed saying that although he knows AI’s work isn’t nearly as good as mine, he can’t ignore the profit margin.](https://old.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/12ff5mw/it_happened_to_me_today/)

- [I lost 3 (thankfully small) clients in 3 months to AI now - and was rejected by a potential client yesterday because the “other guy” uses chatbot for “research” making him more cost effective, so I finally bit the bullet and went to have a play around today… And it’s been banned in Italy!?](https://old.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/12bht72/i_lost_3_thankfully_small_clients_in_3_months_to/)

Another one from a translator:
- [For pocket change, I work as a translator. I told one of the companies that work for that I suddenly developed the ability to speak another language unrelated to any I currently speak and fed their highly technical translation test through chat GPT, which it passed with flying colors. I now take on every scrap of work they give me. I made an extra $2,800 last week. Maybe in the long term this hoarding behavior will be useless but I would at least like to survive the first couple rounds of layoffs](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/12ixmd0/did_recent_ai_events_change_your_life_plans/jfwoiaj/)

People keep telling me not to worry... "don't worry new jobs will be made." But what if I actually enjoyed being an artist? What it felt really fulfilling to make money off of something I loved doing..? Also can anyone link to the new job postings?
