People in here are giving really bad advice. 

The teacher does not seem unreasonable. They are using a tool that they may or may not know is ineffective at detecting, but probably was told to use by the faculty. ChatGPT has created issues with traditional assignments, and some people are cheating. Universities are trying to adapt to this change — don’t panic. 

If you really didn’t use AI, do NOT come across as hostile right off the bat, as it will set red flags. Immediately going to the Dean is not going to help you — that is such bad advice I can’t even comprehend why someone would suggest that. The Professor is not trying to fail you; they are asking for an informal meeting to talk about the allegation. 

Explain to them that you did not use AI, and ask how you can prove it. Bring another paper you wrote, and tell them you have a Word editing history, if it you have it. Just talk with the professor  — they are not out to get you; they want you to succeed. They just want to ensure no one is cheating on their assignments. 

If and only if they are being unreasonable in the meeting, and seem determined to fail you (and you really didn’t use AI), should you escalate it.
