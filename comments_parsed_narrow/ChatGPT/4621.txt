It is good for adding fluff to text. But you need to supply the structure. So its a good way to get ideas for writing but you need a certain level of knowledge on a topic to get a good final piece. It helps me move past writers block.
I have also, 

... asked it dumb questions to generate ideas.

... sent my kids to ask it questions for homeschool assignments, then have them tell me how it's wrong (or right, but teenagers like to argue) and then I get a two sided report while avoiding the risk of them asking ChatGPT and thinking I don't know how they write. Cheating might work for school kids but not so well for home educated kids. 

...told my husband to debate his political passions with it so he wouldn't spend so much time expounding on his ideas for me when I'm busy, I've informed him it's a public service as many of the online things are essentially text products.

... asked i to explain why X is Y as a good starter

...and asked it to detail the consequences/effects/prejudices of X

It's good to remember ChatGPT is currently inappropriate because it's still learning what parts of the Internet it should repeat, so we technically have the opportunity to ask what the sum of the Internet really is. Scary.
