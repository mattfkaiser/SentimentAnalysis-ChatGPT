A lawyer used an artificial intelligence program called ChatGPT to help prepare a court filing for a lawsuit against an airline.
The program generated bogus judicial decisions, with bogus quotes and citations, that the lawyer submitted to the court without verifying their authenticity.
The judge ordered a hearing to discuss potential sanctions for the lawyer, who said he had no intent to deceive the court or the airline and regretted relying on ChatGPT.
The case raises ethical and practical questions about the use and dangers of A.I. software in the legal profession.
