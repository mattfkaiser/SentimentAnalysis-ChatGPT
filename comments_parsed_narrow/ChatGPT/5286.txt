I can’t believe what I’m even reading. Your professor needs a good lesson on ChatGPT. It’ll literally say anything you want it to and I’m not sure how a school professor doesn’t know that. This is beyond retarded imho. But it seems that a certain group of people will believe absolutely everything it says even though it’s only in Very early development. Maybe write an essay on ChatGPT explaining what it does and how it does, and why it can’t be trusted. It’ll say it wrote it only because it can write it the exact same way, not because it has. Could also try to get ahold of the devs or representatives of GPT and let them explain to the school via call or email, why it cannot be trusted on this. Cause if it was That easy to find out whether someone used GPT to write their whole essay or even a part of it, why aren’t literally all the other schools in the world doing this exact same thing to bust students? You guessed it! It doesn’t work like that and most of the world seems to know it.
