I teach, and I think it's pretty obvious when chatgpt is used... chatgpt has a very specific style of writing that is also often clearly distinct from the previous writing style or ability of the student. Frankly I would only use whatever stupid AI-checking tools in order to have some kind of "outside" evidence of cheating. The real evidence is just reading the paper.
