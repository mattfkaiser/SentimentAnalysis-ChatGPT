So I ran a small experiment with ChatGPT, and I found it said it wrote all 10 essays I gave it, that were written by me prior to ChatGPT being invented. I asked it about its confidence of that, and it was highly confident to moderately confident.

Open AI really need to address this quite urgently, it really needs to ensure that ChatGPT written and human written text can't be differentiated reliably.
