Russian translation is correct. I know English, Russian and Ukrainian. I did some tests as well. But on far more complex texts. My conclusion, you've still shouldn't use it to translate something for commercial product like a videogame. You can use it, but human that knows both languages still needs to check and correct the translation. Quality of translation pretty similar to google translate. One interesting thing that happened during those experiments. I had a typo in my text. I've written word "word" instead of "world". Google translate translated it as "word" but ChatGPT understood that I meant "world" and it's a typo and translated it as "world".
