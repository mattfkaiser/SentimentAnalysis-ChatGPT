If you’re serious about collecting recipes from the internet, consider Paprika.  Works on desktops and phones and is a paid application, fortunately not some subscription BS.  There are alternatives.  I’ve been using it for years for the reason mentioned by OP so it’s faster than ChatGPT for me. I believe that there is at least one XML standard for recipes.
