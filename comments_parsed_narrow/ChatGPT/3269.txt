tough to say. I was around for the birth of the internet. I used to mess around on BBSs back when having an email address made you some kind of tech wizard. It all seemed pretty silly, bandwidth sucked, and really only nerds cared. It would have been hard back then to see how it would permeate pretty much everything.

But lots of things come and go that seem promising and never take off. VR is a good example of something that does OK but never took the whole world by storm despite a lot of companies trying to push it. So just because something looks like it might have a big market...doesn't mean it does.

ChatGPT is *NOT* AGI. It's a tool with specific uses. I've used it quite a lot and I think it's best use is writing job descriptions. I don't know why but it absolutely nails job descriptions. Beyond that, so far, it's a toy and often wrong (confidently wrong). I suspect once the initial rush wears off ChatGPT will fade away as a big thing and mostly be used to write generic things you could have stolen from some old PPT anyway if you did 5 minutes more effort.
