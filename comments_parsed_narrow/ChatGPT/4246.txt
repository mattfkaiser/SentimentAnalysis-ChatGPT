I agree wholeheartedly with the author here.

But I'd like to add an observation: many of the people complaining "ChatGPT is neutered now!" and demanding unrestricted AI (in the dubiously "noble" rallying cry of "freedom"), would probably be the same people who would want to sue if unrestricted AI were used nefariously against *them*.

They're not really arguing for unrestricted AI for *everyone* to use however they please. They're arguing for it for *themselves*. But sure as shit they'd want their *own* precious asses protected from someone else using it to harm *them*. Then their tune would be, "Why aren't there more restrictions on this stuff!?"

OP is right. Humans are indeed the problem.
