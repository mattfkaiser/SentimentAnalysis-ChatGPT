>Collect examples of ChatGPT claiming to have written famous works, but also works by important figures in the professor's own field of study.

Screw that, use a sample of **your professor's own writing** and ask ChatGPT if it wrote it. For bonus points, get the writing sample from an older journal article published years before ChatGPT ever existed. Then screencap and send to professor, department head, and school's academic honesty officer.
