I suppose this will happen more and more. Clearly OpenAI is afraid of getting sued if it offers "legal guidance", and most likely there were strong objections from the legal establishment.

I don't think it will stop things in the long term though. We know that ChatGPT can do it and the cat is out of the bag.
