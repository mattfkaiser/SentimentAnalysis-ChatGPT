The internet was toy to you, but networking and the internet was a massive snap forward for science and business in those days.  T2 for universities was a gamechanger.  ChatGPT being so useful to the everyday person, once they understand how to use it and how it works, is what amazes me. Most people right now think it's like another version of Alexa when it's actually completely different.

I like the comparison to Windows 95.  I liken chatGPT to where computers were in the 80s; just starting to become useful to the everyday person, rather than a room-filling appliance for a corporation's paperwork.
