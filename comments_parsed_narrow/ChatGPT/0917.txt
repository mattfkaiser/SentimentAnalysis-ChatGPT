Trust me, I have internal conflicts over this stuff nonstop lately yet day by day every scenario I try to play devils advocate with, and then ChatGPT still delivers. Even where it’s not perfect today, it’s just around the corner to where it will be.

I don’t think the problem is Gen AI being the limiting factor, it’s humans not knowing how to utilize it all to the greatest benefit yet. Which in turn is where it gets scary.
