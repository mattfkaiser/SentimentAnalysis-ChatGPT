What an interesting post! Thanks for sharing.  


I like creating unique personas by combining famous historical figures and fictitious characters. Ever wondered what it would be like to be in a sesh with Snoop Dog, Seth Rogen, and Towelie? Just popped them into ChatGPT. Need some business advice? What would Bill Gates and Steve Jobs advise you to do? Looking for a creative idea?  Can Mark Twain and Iron Man help?  


And the combinations that you can make are literally limitlness.
