The expertise of the therapist matters a lot. I am almost 30, and have been to therapist since I was a kid. No one could tell me what was going on and it took me 26 years to be diagnosed properly. After that, another few years of therapists until I found one with the right technique and background.

This is not to discourage you, just explaining the reality of most people and therapy. Instead of using chatGPT for therapy, I would use it to guide you in a discovery process.

What does her symptoms look like? What questions would a professional ask to gather a better picture? What conditions are under diagnosed, especially in females, but could be relevant to her case? What  therapy techniques had positive results in studies of these conditions?

You get the point. Try to narrow down possibilities and you might get help faster. But still, the right therapist is worth the search.
