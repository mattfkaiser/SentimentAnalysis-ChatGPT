That is completely incorrect. The address from which chatgptâ€™s back-end servers browse are unknown to a person interacting with their front-end systems.

Browser bots are exposed to many different kinds of attacks. Knowing their IP address could prove helpful but sending their bot to gather data from a compromised/malicious server might be one step further.
