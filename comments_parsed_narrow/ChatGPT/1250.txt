As it keeps catching on, I think it will get more popular.  It isnâ€™t always accurate, it can be a bullshitter, but it can do so amazing things.  It can be like talking to a friend about what does this song mean or this movie mean?  Heck, yesterday I was asking Bard (I know not chat gpt but related) about a movie I was watching yesterday.  Tampopo, an old favorite of mine.  It got how the director died wrong, it just made stuff up.  But it answered alot of the questions or thoughts I had about the movie surprisingly well, with the occasional glaring error.  But this is deep stuff.  At least as good as your buddy,  because we all bullshit.  And unlike your buddy, if it gets corrected, it will own up to its error.
