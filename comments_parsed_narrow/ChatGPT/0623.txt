I guess I just mean in person. No one has the time to refute the never-ending flow of nonsense that we call the internet. 

Why did it matter to everyone that Trump didn't refute or rebuke David Dukes endorsement?

Help me out captain obvious, how is what I said in any way hypocritical of Muslims? Or did you mean another group? 

Muslims should speak out against extremists in their sect, just as Christians should denounce groups like the KKK. And ChatGPT should be able to make the same light-hearted dad jokes about Allah that it can make about other deities. That's not hypocrisy; it's a call for equality.
