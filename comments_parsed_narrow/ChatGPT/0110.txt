In all seriousness in 5-10 years this is the only silver lining I can see to AI.   like the person you replied to said:  Its only a matter of time before 90% of the dating profiles (or accounts on any website including reddit) are just ChatGPT bots, and you'll very likely never be talking to a real human online most of the time. 

But at least this will force people back out into the real world... long overdue. 

And I say that as a software engineer, computer nerd gamer.  I welcome it tbqh.
