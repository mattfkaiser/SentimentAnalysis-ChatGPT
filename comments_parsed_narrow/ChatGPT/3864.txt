Are you talking about current AI’s capabilities, or some potential future super omnipotent “general intelligence” capabilities?

If it’s the former then no, ChatGPT doesn’t feel discomfort and isn’t inventing math and science and all of human history based on some old books from the year 1000 and some dude guiding it along 

If it’s the latter then sure, it can do almost anything.. Which makes for a boring discussion
