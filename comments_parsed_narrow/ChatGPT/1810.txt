I did a eulogy for my dad without chatgpt several years ago. Recently I was asked to do a eulogy for my grandfather. I remembered how hard it was for my dad and tried chatgpt for help, because it is emotionally draining and things get chaotic. Now, I didn't ask it to just write a eulogy. I started with give me an outline for a eulogy for 3 minutes. I spent most of my time brainstorming happy memories offline, specific details that were important to me, and then used the skeleton outline to input my actual eulogy.  It didn't feel fake after editing it to include my personal touch and important memories. 

But it did help me get started when I felt like I couldn't. That's where it can help.
