chatGPT is being fine tuned on a larger dataset constantly. However as we continue to add in new capabilities, we dont exactly know what the long term effect of this retraining is as of yet. We could be seeing more knowledge loss, although personally I have only seen it more confidently tell me that it doesnt know things it doesnt know, which is a desired effect. Keep in mind with others posts which aren't your direct experience, there is always the potential for tampering or lack of context (for instance, if you ask an unrelated question after a long conversation, you are likely to get much worse answers).
