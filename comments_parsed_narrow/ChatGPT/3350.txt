Wolfram is basically already cheating and most of my professors let me use it and just turn in what it spit out to “show my work”

I think STEM is perfectly fine with shit like chatGPT because we’ve been doing shit like it for years. Idk why fine arts are making a huge deal out of it, you still have to put effort into wolfram to actually get the right answer the same way as chatGPT.
