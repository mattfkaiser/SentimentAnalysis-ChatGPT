I'm the exact same way, and only recently have I begun to realize my true potential. I also just got diagnosed with ADHD, and being properly medicated has changed my life. Does it suck I have to be medicated to fit my thought patterns into a poorly designed box? Yeah, definitely. But it also rocks succeeding now when I always knew I could.

My new meds in combination with ProfGPT have really changed my life. I wrote a prompt that would input my notes from the semester (I'm a fast typer, so my notes rock, it's retention/regurgitation I suck at) piece by piece. Then, I had ProfAI independently point out the 10 most important things from the chapter, and (using an example exam) create a practice exam for that chapter from those highlights. Using this method, it took me about 45 mins of prompting and waiting and reprompting, but I was able to get 40 pages of practice questions. My only studying for the final exam (cognitive psychology, so not an easy one) was this practice exam and reviewing the answers I got wrong. 

Ultimately, ProfGPT's exam was harder than the actual test and I got a 98%! That's the highest grade I've ever gotten on an exam, and even though I used ChatGPT, I didn't cheat a single bit. That's how I imagine AI should be used in the classroom. Though, I vastly prefer a Socratic discussion based class to an exam based class. I feel those engage our critical thinking methods more than just regurgitation. It did feel good to beat them at their own game for once, though.
