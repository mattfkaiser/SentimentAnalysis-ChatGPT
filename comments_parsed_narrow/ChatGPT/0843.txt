Basically the same thing happened to me, but before chatGPT. I went to the doctor after my muscles got very sore and my pee had turned brown, and they just told me to take an ibuprofen (I think that's Tylenol in America, not sure)

I was incredulous so I looked it up on Google and it matched the symptoms to rhabdomyolysis, so I got a second opinion and they agreed, and ran the necessary bloodwork.

So this isn't really something _new_ about chatGPT, but it's sure much more convenient now. And perhaps more powerful as well.
