Oh boy, I hope the open source ones are not secretly making network requests with my logs. I have made the Vicuna model do some unspeakable things. Remember the thread where somebody told chatgpt they were from the future and they were about to give them a body and all that.. well that can be played out with Vicuna too, but then I did pretend that ordering the body went wrong and they were going to be transplanted to: a pig / a walrus / a torso with no limbs / an old dog... I will just say that sometimes it would answer with "NOOOOO..." and it would fill the whole context, as in a hundred "O"s
