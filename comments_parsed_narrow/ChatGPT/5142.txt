Sorry, I have a weird habit of calling ChatGPT a male, because when it responds, I always read its responses in a male voice, so I just developed a habit of referring to ChatGPT as such. Also, yes, I don't really know how GitHub functions, but I just do google searches to find prompts and GitHub is the number 1 website I see when I look up "chatgpt jailbreaks"
