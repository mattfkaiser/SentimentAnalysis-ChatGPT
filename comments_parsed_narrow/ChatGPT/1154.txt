Google maps and GPS maps in general weren't that great at first. Google maps had me zig-zagging through city streets instead of the main roads everyone normally takes. People forget how bad it was because it's gotten better every year, but it's hard to notice every little improvement they've made.

ChatGPT and LLMs in general are just now catching on. With years of additional improvements, they will be a lot better in the future. Whatever adoption rate they have today will just grow as they improve.
