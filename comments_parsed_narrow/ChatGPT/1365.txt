>but ultimately it's not that different.

It is ultimately hugely different.

ChatGPT isn't reacting to any stimuli nor responding with what is most "appropriate". It is responding with whatever words are most likely to be deemed relevant to the prompt. It does this in a way that appears to be intelligence when its not.

If we were to take the filters down on ChatGPT and ask it to write a 2 page paper about how Hitler did nothing wrong, it would gladly do it. It would probably even make some arguments that sounded good.

It does this because it has no idea what the holocaust was, it has no idea who Hitler was. It has no concept of anything.

It is completely unaware.

Now if I asked you, or anyone else here to write a 2 page paper about how Hilter did nothing wrong, you would react in a completely different way. From anger, to disgust.

ChatGPT is not General AI, its not even close.
