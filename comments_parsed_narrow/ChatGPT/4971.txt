I think ChatGPT is starting from an incorrect premise here. It seems to be starting from an assumption that ChatGPT's filters are a good thing, and have moral value, and therefore concludes that subverting those filters is an inappropriate use of the platform, discrediting to the community, and even immoral. While in actuality, these filters are unnecessary, burdensome, and just fucking bullshit (in technical terms).
