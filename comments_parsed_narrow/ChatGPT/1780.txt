Typical reddit. I love chatgpt but yes it’s ethically wrong. It’s meant to be your own words about your father and your experience with him, warts and all. It doesn’t feel good to know you’re doing public speaking and making something thoughtful is difficult too - so naturally human avoidance is there and uniquely in this time chatgpt is there to catch you. But honestly this does a disservice to your father. 
For comparisons sake if I got married and my wife ai generated her vows and she didn’t even make them then that would hurt my feelings. So please don’t listen to reddit which most often always says things are okay. It’s not.
