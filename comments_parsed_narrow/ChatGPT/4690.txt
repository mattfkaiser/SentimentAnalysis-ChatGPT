Question: if it gives a bad advice, what repercussions will they face? ChatGPT will lose its lawyer's license? It never had one in the first place. Because it's not a lawyer or a doctor or any registered professional. It's a program that can confidently say stuff, often very accurately too.

If a person is allowed to say stupid stuff, a program should definitely be. The only court they can fear is the court of public opinion, because people lack critical thinking and take for granted what they're confidently told like it's not their responsibility to fact check and make the right decision, not the "he/she/they/gpt told me to do it" decision.
