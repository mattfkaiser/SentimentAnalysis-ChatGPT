I think ChatGPT is definitely a groundbreaking tech, but comparing it to the birth of the internet might be a bit of a stretch. Sure, it's gonna change how we interact with machines and might revolutionize certain industries, but the internet has had a much broader impact on our lives as a whole.

ChatGPT is more like an amazing tool that'll make life easier in some ways, kinda like smartphones or voice assistants did. But the internet? That thing changed *everything*. It's hard to imagine anything having the same kind of ripple effect again.

So yeah, ChatGPT is cool and super useful, but I don't think it's on the same level as the birth of the internet. Still, I'm excited to see where this tech goes and how it'll shape our future!
