I talked to ChatGPT quite a bit as I waited on my grandmother's deathbed last month. It's read all the grief books and was surprisingly insightful. Using her texts was a cool way to get some sort of closure. I also used ChatGPT to write the obituary and the eulogy, using terms like 'edit for brevity and clarity'.
