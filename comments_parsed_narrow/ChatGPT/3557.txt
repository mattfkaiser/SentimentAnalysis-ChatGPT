As a physicist, I can say 100% that chatGPT at the moment cannot in any world write a PhD dissertation, and certainly cannot ace PhD qualifying exams. Besides the written part, which it couldn't do anyway, there is a verbal part, where you would get torn to shreds. Also, what sort of physicist gets their PhD to "land a CEO position?"
