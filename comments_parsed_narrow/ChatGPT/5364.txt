You use a computer to search for and gather data for a essay/paper.

ChatGPT is nothing more than a vastly large database of the same information available online.. Its like a glorified search engine that just happens to be able to put information into a readable format as results, instead of just providing a bunch of links to each location it extracted the data..

So where is the issue with having it generate the facts for a specific essay/paper and lay them out in a readable format.. Just put a Quote mark at the start of the paper, and end of the paper..
