I asked chatGPT to translate this.


I call on all of the
 holy powers, 
Great and small, 
The children of Heimdall; 
I want, O Father of the Slain, 
To ask for the 
life of Aurvandil, 
The wolf 
and the serpent, 
Before the VÃ¶lva.
 One and eight,
 Until the three of Aegir,
 Ten and count Two 
great winters, 
The men themselves 
About the destiny 
of the son of Hefnd. 
Last, the Sun-tally 
Will count the suns,
 Nor will the Ruler of Men
 Ever become the Beloved.
