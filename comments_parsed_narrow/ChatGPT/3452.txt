I don't get the problem with ChatGPT. Can't it aid students in learning? Like when they have a problem when doing homework at home they could ask ChatGPT for help on the subject. There really shouldn't be any need (anymore) to cheat. ChatGPT would have been a massive help for me if I was still in school
