Good luck writing that paper if the prof requires you to pen and paper it in person in 60 minutes. It just means instead of a beautiful well crafted essay you get a much more raw evaluation. That's my take on chatGPT, you already couldn't trust things people did on their own but at least paying someone to write an essay for you was expensive and could be caught if their 'style' was too different, and plagiarism has ways to catch. But chatGPT basically blows that out of the water and the only way to make sure someone knows something is to make them prove it in person. 

College isn't a waste of time if done properly, essentially, learning how to learn, asking the profs questions and slowly becoming an expert in a subject. You will absolutely have a much harder time doing it on your own. Likewise, having a college degree proves to employers that you have a baseline skill level, something really hard to prove if self-taught. Many  people do just treat college as a bunch of things to memorize and discard though, those people basically wasted their money
