Only use chatGPT when you are outside of work, unless they explicitly permit it.  If you don't you'll get fired.  Do not use it on ANY company resources, without their permission.  You may also find yourself in more serious trouble by trying to bipass security measures.  Your company may even be able to sue you, as a professional, if you screw up bad enough.  And in extreme cases, people have ended up in prison for this type of behavior.
