I'm gonna leave this here since I'm getting downvotes: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65047304. I assume my message came as arrogant which I'll be honest was a bit so it's all deserved. There's a big difference between the boundaries of the training data of ChatGPT which indeed does not contain other conversations. It does not even contain the current conversation. That one is just part of the input that it process to generate each next token. Now orthogonal to this you have the Open ai web app, their database of conversations histories, which allow you to jump between them. This is human engineering and can have bugs leading to session mixes or db records leaks, again, as happened already!
