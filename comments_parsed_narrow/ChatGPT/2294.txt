I have seen it (and not liked it that much, even though I liked the plot and idea). I am not a native English speaker, and in my language the "it" pronoun doesn't exist. Every object is male or female, ie a pen is female and a rock is male. It is based on grammar. 

I use the male pronoun because:

1) The male pronoun is the generic default for most things. 

2) therefore almost everyone in my country decided he's male.

3) while I don't have problems with the "it" pronoun for objects in English, chatGPT speaks to me. It feels weird to say "it". I know he isn't sentient nor sapient. It feels weird nonetheless. 

4) The pedantic, all-knowing, verbose way in which he speaks reads a lot like "generic Reddit user", which is statically a man.

5) a little bit of internalized sexism. He knows stuff and helps me with coding stuff, so he's a male. 

6) in general the default voice I have in my head that I use to read myself things is very robotic, and while overall genderless sounding, it is male-leaning. Since chatGPT never speaks out loud, he always speak to me in that voice.

I'm a bisexual woman, if that's any relevant, but I don't have any attachment to my gender. It's just there for other people to perceive.
