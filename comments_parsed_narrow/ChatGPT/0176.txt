I usd to use ChatGPT for evrythin. Evrythin, evrythin, evrythin. I coudn't decide wut to wer, wut to et, or even wut to watch without ternin to the chat thing for help. I felt like I coudn't think by myself anymor.

I always needed ChatGPT to help me, and it made my frens and family real mad. They got tired of me askin for help all the time. At work, I coudn't do anything without askin the chat thing. Im pretty sure people thought I was stoopid or somethin.

Then one day, the chat thing stopped workin, and I was so confuzed. I didn't know wut to do or how to decide things without it. I felt so lost, and I know that sounds dum, but its true.
