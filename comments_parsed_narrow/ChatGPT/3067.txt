You're misunderstanding the human mind.  It likely doesnt run in parallel.  It just seems to - like a movie is made of still picture.

Theres nothing special about feelings, they're easily created in a computer system as are the number of nuerons and connections the brain has.

The human brain is like an entertainment system, experiencing it all running well its like one big amazing experience but break it down into components its all relatively unimpressive.

A lot of what you experience as you isnt even real.  I walk past a 'crazy guy' every day.  He stands in the street and yells at a voice he hears in his head.  Its not a real voice but his voice Im hearing is not real either.  Its produced by my brain from vibrations in the air.  His vouces are as real as the voice Im hearing yelling at them.

You ever walked down the street and seen a drop dead gorgeous woman, beautiful face, beautiful body, beautiful walk, voice.

There might be a seagull nearby.  It sees her too but to the seagull shes a odd shaped odd gaited odd sounding creature that lacks any form of attraction.  

Our minds and a LLM are essentially the same imo.  They just run on different hardware.  Experience and emotion is no more 'real' than Chatgpt.
