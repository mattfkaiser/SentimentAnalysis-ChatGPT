I suspect a number of educators are bluffing about their methods of AI-detection or specific stories of incidents so that studemts will be scared away from even trying to use it in ways that do not align with academic policies. 

But if this guy is genuinely giving students 0s because ChatGPT randomly decided to take credit for something it didn't write, that's pretty messed up. 

Especially because it incentivizes especially strange behaviors that don't even have educational value (eg. You actually HAVE TO use ChatGPT now, to at least check how it would respond, and possibly add in some intentional errors to an already not-plagiarized text in order to sway the result away from accusations of plagiarism)
