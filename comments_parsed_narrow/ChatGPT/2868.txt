I don't think there is a good way of detecting it since students can use it so differently and as fellow redditors mentioned here, there are a lot of workarounds. I guess you assume that students won't bother doing these workarounds, but they not even that hard. The text or essay, or whatever assignment they've got can be done by chatGpt so differently if they just give it a prompt like: " Imagine you're a student, translator,... Etc. They can make it very believable just in a few clicks, even in the free version.
