Honestly I can see this being a thing. I only have the web search plugin and it already can accurately reference and explain the searched text information (again only have web search) accurately while again providing a reference link that is live and working that truly does contain the information that ChatGPT explained to me. This is ONLY one plugin and doesn’t even allow it to have further understanding capabilities or the ability to “see” and yet its already this far? Yeah I can definitely see something that can actually see and understand while simultaneously being capable of understanding the scientific principles behind whatever it is they are seeing being capable of being better at providing relevant answers than a “simple” algorithm.
