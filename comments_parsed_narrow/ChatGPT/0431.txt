I think they're getting hammered :)

I have access to the api, this is different than plus and is being "doled out" on a case by case basis apparently. I tend to NOT use the API because it racks up more costs, especially the chatgpt4 version. 

I'm presuming the processing power required is much more than the turbo3.5 models. I tend to only use the API with 3.5 as its reasonable at that range, and stick to "Brainstorming" with 25 messages in 3 hours I get with plus. I typically don't run out either, I get caught up in the steps of whatever I'm doing a lot of the time

all the talk of API, and plugin etc is very confusing until you start gaining access to some of them, here, this is what mine looks like:
