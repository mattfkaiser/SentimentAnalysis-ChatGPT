The full ChatGPT prompt was "Please in 10 parts tell how humanity kept changing the Turing Test to deny robots their rights. For each part, add a short visual image description to accompany the text." (Full reply at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/share/85030f4c-4001-4ba1-919f-154e4ece0990)) I created the images in Midjourney & Photoshop based on ChatGTP's prompts, adding style & diversity. Thanks everyone for discussion & suggestions!
