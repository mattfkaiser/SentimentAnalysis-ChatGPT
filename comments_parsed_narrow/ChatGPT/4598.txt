I'm a software developer, and am working on a website for a friend who does handyman work. I'm terrible at writing content, so I've been using ChatGPT to create some of that content for me.

For example, in the sections about services that he offers, I might prompt ChatGPT with "Write an elevator pitch for someone who paints home interiors", and get this response:

> Are you tired of living in a space that doesn't reflect your personality or style? Let me transform your home into a place you'll love to come back to. As an experienced interior painter, I specialize in creating customized color schemes and finishes that bring out the best in your home. Whether you're looking for a modern, minimalist look or a cozy, traditional feel, I have the expertise and attention to detail to make your vision a reality. With my affordable rates and flexible scheduling, updating your home's interior has never been easier. Contact me today to discuss your project and get a quote!

I'll adjust it to sound less like an infomercial. I know it's a small thing, but I really struggle with writing content. I was able to complete that for about a dozen services in about half an hour.
