ChatGPT is eerily good (flawless?) in terms of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. OP makes a bunch of errors in those areas in their post and subsequent comments. And any person who writes with perfect grammar etc. will have some writing **style** that I've never seen in AI-written text: humor, rhetorical questions, parentheticals, some sense of originality.

Tl;dr: it's a failure on both sides that a teacher needs to use AI to detect AI-written content.
