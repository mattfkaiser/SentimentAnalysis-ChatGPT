The only way this would be unhealthy is if you kept having chat gpt pretend to be her and never moved on. But no, you used this as a one time resource to receive needed closure. This is almost exactly what someone in drama therapy (having someone else play the part of the lost one) or art therapy (using dolls/puppets to represent the lost one) would do for the exact same situation, youâ€™re just using technology instead of performance/art objects.
