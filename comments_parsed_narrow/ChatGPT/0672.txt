If you use Edge and visit a web page, you can open Bing in the sidebar and ask Bing about something on the adjacent web page. Bing has always used ChatGPT and Bing was using GTP 4 before GTP 4 was generally available. So maybe on a recipe page, you could ask Bing ( in the Sidebar)  to show the adjacent page's  recipe ingredients,  cooking instructions and tips. You can export your conversation.

Since Bing can access the web, it probably knows about this Reddit thread.
