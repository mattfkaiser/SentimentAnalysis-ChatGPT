You're in an echo chamber... chamber... chamber...

chatgpt was created with a large amount of input from reddit and twitter and other places where free speech is censored and only leftist thoughts are allowed.  It was created using input from places like reddit where any opinion which isn't 400 miles left of center is censored and where actual literal calls to violence from the left are unchallenged and the "wrong pronoun use" by the moderates is banned as "hate speech" and where I'm writing this on a throw away account because reddit bans any account which doesn't parrot a very very specific world view.

If reality had a leftist bias (classical liberalism is not the same as what you want, and I will not pretend that modern leftism deserves to share a name with a word based in "liberty") San Francisco would be a shining example of low costs, low unemployment, low crime, and safety for everyone.
