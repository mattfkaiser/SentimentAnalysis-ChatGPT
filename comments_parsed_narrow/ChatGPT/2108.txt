OP, here is something you need to understand for this time and for the next : people don’t need a solution when they don’t have a problem. What you need to do is not a seminar to tell people about a solution. You need to ask people their problems and see how ChatGPT can solve them, THEN show them the solution. For instance, let’s say it has allowed you to reduce a truckload of paperwork that used to take hours in mere minutes. Ask your colleagues or manager what is the most tedious and time-consuming work they have, ask them to measure how much time it actually take them. Now find how to reduce that with Chat Gpt and have them do it. Do NOT do it and show them, make them do it themselves (you can help them, of course).

That’s how you get people convinced.
