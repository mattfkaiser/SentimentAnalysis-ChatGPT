Wow. Sorry about your friend. I am so moved by the way people are using chatgpt to heal and grow. Even in this thread there are multiple ways people use it to process grief with no instructions or guide. I love how powerful and creative we all can be. Counselors are good, but there is a lot we can do on our own. Hope you keep playing music!
