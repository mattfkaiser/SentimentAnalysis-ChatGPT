My thought is that Chatgpt and other LLMs and AI toold isn't for you or I or most people. Not even for professionals among us who pay for Pro level access to API. 

 The data we input into it is useful to OpenAI etc, we're tools. The tech is ultimately for big corporations who'll license it for millions and billions to use on us to further enrich themselves.

 Corporations have no interest in its potentials outside profit making,  the way it can improve our lives or free us from work or enrich all of us while improving society (if some of these come to pass it will be *despite* corporations/ capitalism) instead their interest is how they can leverage it to extract and transfer more wealth, how to better exploit our labour and how they can monetize us further / more.

For now, us civilians using it casually or users who are using it creatively or have cool, awesome ideas (some of these cool ideas/ startups will get copied/ bought out by the behemoths). We're all just beta testers who also  feed it more data.
