Sorry to hear about your kids situation, here's my idea about ChatGPT: it's very good at pretending to be good at a field in front of non-professionals. 

For example when I talked to it for the first time I was totally amazed by how it can give advice in any profession in a professional manner, but then I experimented it with a bit with my own field, which is airline piloting, then I realized most of what it says is pretty inaccurate or total jibberish.

The problem you have with the current psychologist is probably comming from communication or personal issues. 

AI will definitely do a better job in almost every field in the near future, but for now it's always a good idea to turn to the rea, licensed professionals.
