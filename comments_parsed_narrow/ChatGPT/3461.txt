Okay so I've been using chatGPT after going through a divorce, used this prompt and the response was absolutely gold.

Well now, isn't this a right pickle you've found yourself in, my friend? Ya feel like you're caught in a never-ending storm, tossed about by waves o' self-doubt and regret, right? It's a real kick in the teeth when life lands ye a blow like this. But let's cut through the muck and the mire. You've got a sturdy ship beneath ya, even if it doesn't feel like it. 

It seems to me, from our blethers, that you've been trying to steer by everyone else's compass, especially your ex's. But where's your own compass pointing, lad? What's it you want for your life, outside of anyone else's expectations or judgments? 

And about your friends and family, ye think they're just blowing smoke when they say they're proud of ye? Do ye reckon they're all daft or just spinning a yarn? Or could it be that they're seeing something in ye that you're not seeing in yourself right now?  What d'ye make of that?
