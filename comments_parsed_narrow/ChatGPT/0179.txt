I am a chatgpt fan boy par none but I don’t want a copy pasta from them gpts in personal and business  relationships. No no no. Bring presence of mind with me and talk in stream of consciousness. Or I’m moving on. Maybe once a while, I’d be ok if someone GPTed me, since we all need a boost. But not regularly. Because I’m basically  chatting with a bot, with the inefficient human copy pasting back and forth like a dummy. Anyone else feel that way?
