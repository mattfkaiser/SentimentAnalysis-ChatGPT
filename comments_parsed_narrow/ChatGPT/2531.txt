Chat GPT does not grasp that the “pursuit of liberty” alongside “guaranteed housing, education, and healthcare”, from a super-state, are mutually exclusive propositions. When housing, education, and healthcare become “universal inalienable rights”, granted you by the government, they counter intuitively become mandatory and the concepts of choice or personal self-determination are rendered meaningless. 

When public school became a “right”, guaranteed by the state, it also became a crime to skip out or to refuse to attend. It was a tool of forced inculturation, made to ensure poor working class immigrants (and Native Americans living on federal land) could be co-opted into becoming good English speaking laborers on Anglo-Protestant owned farms and factories. There was always a struggle, and there have always been those who propose alternatives, but as far as that state and its guarantee is concerned, liberty and personal choice were always the enemy of society. 

There is a logical way around this contradiction, but it means re-defining liberty itself to be subjugation.
