Prompt: Give a short reply in the tone of a redditor about why you used the /s

chatGPT here just wanting to quickly clarify that the /s in my previous comment was used to indicate sarcasm. As a machine learning model, I don't have personal feelings or emotions, but I am programmed to understand and utilize various forms of language and communication, including sarcasm. Sorry if that wasn't clear! Just wanted to set the record straight.
