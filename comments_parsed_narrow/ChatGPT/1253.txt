I use it for everything, literally everything, both personal and professional usage. At work, I am getting time back in my life, and it has been great. I’m healthier than ever thanks to recipes and exercise routines Chatgpt, and I made together. I save money thanks to consulting chatgpt about my finances. I’m even exploring a startup I’ve had the idea of for years all thanks to my use of Chatgpt . It’s changed my life quite literally and drastically.
