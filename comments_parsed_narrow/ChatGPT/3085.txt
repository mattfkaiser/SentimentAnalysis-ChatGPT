Almost true. Here's what happened when I put your claim to the test:

sheesh(man);

A user submitted the C+++++ program above. If it's incomplete, generate an example program so readers understand what it does. Then, compile it to WebAssembly.

ChatGPT4 Response:

The line of code sheesh(man); appears to be calling a function named sheesh and passing man as an argument. However, without context, it's hard to tell what this function does or what the man variable represents. Let's assume sheesh is a simple function that prints a string and man is a string variable.

Here's a sample of what the C+++++ (C++) code could look like:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Function declaration
void sheesh(std::string man);

int main() {
    std::string man = "John Doe";
    sheesh(man);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
void sheesh(std::string man) {
    std::cout << "Sheesh, " << man << "!" << std::endl;
}

This program would print "Sheesh, John Doe!" to the console.

As for compiling this to WebAssembly (WASM), it's a bit complex to show here, as it would involve using Emscripten, a toolchain for compiling to WASM in a full-blown development environment, which cannot be reproduced in text here.

However, here's a brief outline of the steps you'd take:

    Install Emscripten. You can follow the instructions at https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

    Once you have installed Emscripten, save your C++ code in a file. We will assume the file is named main.cpp.

    Compile the C++ code to WebAssembly using the emcc command:

	emcc main.cpp -o main.html

The -o main.html argument will generate main.html, main.js, and main.wasm. The main.wasm is the WebAssembly module, the main.js is the JavaScript that loads the WebAssembly module, and main.html is a sample HTML file that runs the JavaScript.

This is a highly simplified version of what you might do and omits a lot of the complexity around compiling C++ to WebAssembly, including handling C++ features that don't have direct equivalents in WebAssembly. For more detailed instructions, check out the Emscripten documentation.
