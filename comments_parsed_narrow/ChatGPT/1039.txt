I needed to submit a request for new hardware for my team at work to perform their jobs effectively. I quickly made a list of bullet points and reasons and sent it to chatGPT to create a professional request of approval for said gear. 

The first draft it made was too wordy. I asked it to shorten it and rewrite taking the formality words out.  I then had to manually edit a few lines and it was perfect. 

Slam. Dunk.
