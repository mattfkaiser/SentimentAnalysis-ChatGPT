Yeah I wrote an SOP last Friday.  Ran every draft paragraph through ChatGPT which rewrote them into lovely professional paragraphs then pasted them into the SOP.

Then I asked it to generate 10 assessment questions in multiple choice form for each topic of the SOP.

Worked really well.

The only caveat, ChatGPT is not 'intelligent' so I still had to manually go through to make sure they output made sense and some didnt.

Some of the multiple choice were like:

Whats the correct way to launch a minuteman nuclear missile?

A Authorization, code check, key, fire.

B Authorization, key, code check, fire.

C Fire, Authorization, code check, key.

Where A and B both work.  It doesnt think about the output so you can get odd results.
