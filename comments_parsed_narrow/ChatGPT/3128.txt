ChatGPT will not suddenly replace humans in work. We are in the peak of a hype cycle for AI, it happens every few years, and it happens with every major new technology we get.   


It will take quite some years before ChatGPT or other AI will really start changing the job market. Business is slower to adapt than people think. Heck, one company I worked at still had a guy manually transferring contracts from one excel to another, he's been doing that since the 90s and he could easily be automated out of the job, but most companies don't actually care enough to pursue every single possible cost saving.   


In 10-15 years I would be interested to see the impacts of AI, but in the next 5 years, I don't expect a lot still.
