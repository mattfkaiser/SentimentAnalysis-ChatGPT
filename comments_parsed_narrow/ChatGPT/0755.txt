I agree with you. I used to use it for some programming solutions I am learning for software testing. Earlier this year when ChatGPT was the newfound god, it was producing some quality snippets with awesome descriptions.

Now the solutions are pure trash. For "testing" my theory, I asked it the same questions I asked it in February. And the replies now are okay for a high school homework maybe; not more than that. Luckily I saved the prior responses.

The output it silly like bongs search result output and half the time codes don't even work.

At least it is pushing me to work on coding for real.

Also, cancelled my pro subscription. 25 chatGPT4 messages every 3 hours is no where near worth it.
