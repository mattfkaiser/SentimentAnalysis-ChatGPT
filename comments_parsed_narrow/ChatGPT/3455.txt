He's probably tired. I think the only way to tell a cheater from someone who is not from now on is filming the students while they produce the homework. I can see them being forced to study in soundproof cabins where AI is not accessible and I can see Universities that do not offer accomodation closing down. But the day implanting a jack in your brain becomes a thing, then there won't be a way to tell who has got talent and who has not. It will be a matter of being able to pay for the surgery or not. That is way more scary than chat gpt alone because it will produce more inequality.
