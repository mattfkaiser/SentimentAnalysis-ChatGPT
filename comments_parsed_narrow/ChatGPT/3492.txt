Iâ€™m not sure why you are being downvoted, the hyperbole is frustrating. 

Sure AI will displace some work, but their will always be a need for experts and people with specific skills.

If people believe that chatgpt is really going to replace their jobs then they should be out there demanding the best possible UBI or other conditions. Once AI makes your labour worthless you are also effectively worthless to business and government. The idea that the AI unemployed will be living amazing free lives is crazy. Just look at any currently unemployed people.
