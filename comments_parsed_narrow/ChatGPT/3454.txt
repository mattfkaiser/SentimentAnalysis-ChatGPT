I'll be a teacher soon and I've no worries about it. I'll talk about ChatGPT to my students and I'll let them use it. I'll just let them know the downsides and the implications of its overuse and why they can't be making all their essays with it, lest they be useless. They can use it as a tool, it can help them, but it won't, at least for now, replace their brains.

Come the exam they'll fail if they use it for everything.
