I think an acceptable use for chatgpt would be getting stuck on a part of game dev and looking at chatgpt for answers. Seems like something that can get you through the nitty gritty and quickly. 

Ai art is another thing but now is there gonna be a bunch of gpt created media? And if so how does that stack up to those made by humans value wise? Quality wise I hope the difference would be clear, but if you used gpt to make a game wonâ€™t the credit go to that and not you?
