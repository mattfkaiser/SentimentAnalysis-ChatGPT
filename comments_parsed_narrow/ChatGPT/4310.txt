When I asked ChatGPT to stop saying "it's important to..." it responded as follows (how respectful ;) ) : 

"Of course! As an AI language model, my programming is geared towards providing informative and helpful responses that are intended to offer guidance and suggestions. However, I can certainly vary my phrasing to avoid using a particular phrase or wording repeatedly.

In the future, please feel free to let me know if there are any particular words or phrases you would like me to avoid, and I will do my best to provide varied and relevant responses without relying on those specific terms."
