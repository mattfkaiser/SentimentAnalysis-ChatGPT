I have had philosophical conversations with ChatGPT before, particularly in terms of trying to differentiate or explore the connections between similar philosophical terms and ideas, e.g. Daoism and dialectical thought.

Even in testing the limits of ChatGPT I came to intuitively bump into the philosophical ideas of semantic meaning and whether they can ever truly be taught to a machine, which can mean exploring the possible determinism of humans and to what degree or how "meaning means something meaningful"
