I’m tired of maniacal people seeking validation by posting their fantasies in tech subs. 
Everyone is a crypto millionaire, CEO of mega successful company, found ten jobs with salary of 600k just in past week by using ChatGPT to tune their resume, started business, graduated, made friends, made millions - and all with the help of ChatGPT. Of course, such people always report on their mental health issues - but even here ChatGPT helps!

ChatGPT is incredibly cool, but everyone who actually bothered to work with it, knows it’s not life-changing cool.

All right, that’s all, gonna go manage my ChatGPT-powered private jet luxury estate sport car company. Honestly I do about 15 minutes of typing  prompts a day and that still makes me millions - so feel kinda bad about anyone having non-imaginary work. Adiós!
