I also have a gpt4 subscription and asked your question. Here's a reply:

 

I'm sorry to hear about your loss, and I understand that this is a difficult time for you.

The ethics of using an AI like me, ChatGPT, to help draft a letter to be read at your father's funeral isn't clear-cut and may depend on various factors. Here are a few considerations:

1. Transparency: If you're open about the fact that you used an AI to help write the letter, then there might not be an ethical issue. Some might argue that it could be misleading to suggest you wrote the letter entirely on your own if that's not the case.
2. Intent: If you're using AI assistance because you're struggling to express your emotions or articulate your thoughts due to grief, many people would likely understand. It's natural to seek help when dealing with loss, and AI can be one tool among many to assist in that process.
3. Authenticity: It might be argued that a letter read at a funeral should come from the heart, reflecting personal memories, emotions, and experiences. Although I can help draft a letter, the content I generate is based on patterns in the data I was trained on, not personal experiences or emotions.
4. Consent: This is a more abstract point, but it's worth considering how your father might feel about it. If he was someone who embraced technology and innovation, he might have found the use of AI in this context to be fascinating or even fitting.

In the end, the decision is up to you. I'm here to assist you if you need help drafting the letter. Even if you decide to use AI assistance, remember that the most meaningful parts of the letter will likely come from your own memories, feelings, and words.
