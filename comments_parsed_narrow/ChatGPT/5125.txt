ChatGPT is inherently biased towards whatever the training data leaned towards. To specifically remove these biases without imparting new biases would be impossible to do fairly, as the "middle" is different for every person, and would be a bias in itself. The only truly unbiased option would be to have the AI decline to speak on political matters at all. Which hardly sounds like a satisfying outcome. I think this means it's just up to the creators of the AI to decide how to handle political-ness.
