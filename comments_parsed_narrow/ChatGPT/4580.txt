I am currently struggling with my autism and ADHD and Iâ€™ve been trying to find a way to implement ChatGPT into my system of planning my daily life, goals, prioritising, structure etc. I get overwhelmed easy as well and like you said burn out. Any suggestions as to how I could use it or how you do? Like how do you use it to help plan your days and structure.. do you use same prompts every day so it has context? Any ideas / potential prompts would be much appreciated.
