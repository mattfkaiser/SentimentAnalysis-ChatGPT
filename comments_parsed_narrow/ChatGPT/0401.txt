>Welcome to our podcast! Today, we have a really exciting episode lined up where we dive into the world of our guest. This week, we're joined by Sean Mann, a guy who spent two years in Antarctica, has worked on electronics that have orbited the Earth many times, and even keeps a large wombat as a pet in his apartment. Before we start talking to Sean, I'm super excited to remind you that we have a survey. Please fill out the embedded survey so we can learn more about you and what you enjoy about our podcast. It helps us figure out how to select the best guests and topics for our show and all the other things we do. So please, take three minutes to fill out the survey. Now, let's welcome Sean to the podcast. Thanks for being here!
