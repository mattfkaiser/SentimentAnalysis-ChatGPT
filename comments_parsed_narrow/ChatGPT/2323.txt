I’m really happy to hear this. I have to say that ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful to me as I process bad medical news I got about my son and the decision I have to make about his surgery. It walked me through the entire surgical process, explained in basic terms what will happen, and then gave me a two page list of great questions to ask the surgeon when I met with him last week. 

I think the natural language and reasoning abilities of this AI is remarkable and most people don’t truly understand how helpful it has been for so many of us. And of course this is the worst, it will ever be, and it will just get better every day.
