While I understand your desire to access ChatGPT for work purposes, it's important to adhere to your company's IT policies and guidelines. Attempting to bypass or hide your activities from the IT department could potentially violate company rules and policies, which may have serious consequences.

I would recommend discussing your specific needs and requirements with your IT department or supervisor. They might be able to provide alternative solutions or explore options that are within the company's guidelines. Open communication is often the best approach when it comes to using technology and software in the workplace.
