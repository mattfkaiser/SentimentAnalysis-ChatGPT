You all are slightly misunderstanding the OP I think possibly. How I saw it, the OP sent the defendant's lawyers the agreement thing ChatGPT generated. The lawyer got spooked by the language and was asking if they had representation, which is a kind of normal, acceptable question for them to ask in response to a document like that. In fact lawyers are basically required (usually by state legal rules) to ask if it seems like you have representation.

Then, the OP told them it was ChatGPT and the lawyer responded jokingly that they can talk now because ChatGPT is not counsel yet.

e: I have spent even more seconds thinking about this, sorry I didn't read the OP's title clearly. Edited to reflect, and it seems to be a normal convo. I am also assuming that the defendant's lawyers in OP are doing their job properly and advising OP that they should probably have representation when they're speaking, but can be professional and not obviously screw over OP if they talk with them. Generally self representation is a bad idea from all the reputable sources I've read, but obviously the defendant's lawyer is not going to go as far as saying that and would actually be unprofessional, probably, to say that.
