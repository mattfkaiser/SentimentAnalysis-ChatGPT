Some institutions allow it for some assessments.

At the one I'm at, each assignment will have a note saying one of these options (paraphrased):

* No generative AI allowed.
* \[x,y,and/or z\] specific generative AI programs are allowed. You must explain how you used it and include an appendix of prompts used.
* Generative AI is allowed, but only for \[x,y, and/or z\] purposes. You must include an appendix of prompts used.
* Generative AI use is unrestricted. You must include a description of how you used it, and an appendix of prompts used.

(It's not exactly that, but from memory it is roughly that.)

The teacher must pick one of these for each assignment.
