But... that is the case. There are teenagers today that have a basically illegible handwriting, because they write almost exclusively on keyboards. Ask them to look up something that isn't on the internet (a bunch of that stuff still exists, especially in academia) and they actually won't know how to do it. And, idk - it *does* concern me that people basically can't function in a lot of ways without advanced technologies at hand. 

ChatGPT is, I think, qualitatively different from these examples, though. The point of essay writing, as others have pointed out, is not actually producing a text for publication, but for learning how to write well, and as an extension, how to *think* and *argue* effectively, how to sequence your thoughts into something coherent, how to think creatively and synthesise the thoughts of others into something newm Which in turn teaches you how to spot poor reasoning and weak arguments, an incredibly important skill for any competent and reason-able citizen.

That said, I think the fact that people are using ChatGTP to write essays says more about how abysmally bad we are at educating kids. People really seem to think essay writing is just busywork, they don't understand the value of it - so why do it, if you don't see the point? (And in all fairness,a lot of essay writing *is* just busywork.) I totally get that. My hope is that ChatGPT will force us to rethink how we educate citizens, to reduce the amount of pointless grind, and encourage people to learn about things they find interesting, and teaching them how to teach themselves. To paraphrase Rabinandrath Tagore, education should be the kindling a flame, not the filling of a bucket.
