In Microsoft Word, you can access version history if you have been working on the document in OneDrive or SharePoint. Here's how to do it:

Open your Word document.  
Go to the "File" menu.  
Click on "Info."  
Under "Manage Document," click on "Version History" or "Manage Versions."

You will see a list of autosaved versions of your document. You can open any of these versions to see the changes made at that point.
If you haven't been using OneDrive or SharePoint, Word does not automatically save previous versions of your document. However, it does automatically save a copy of your document every few minutes in case of a crash. This is called an AutoRecover file.

Here's how to access AutoRecover files:

Go to the "File" menu.  
Click on "Options."  
Go to the "Save" tab.

Look at the "AutoRecover file location" field. This is where your AutoRecover files are saved.
Open a new File Explorer window, navigate to this location, and see if there's a copy of your document there.
Keep in mind that AutoRecover is not meant to be a way to access old versions of a file, but rather a way to recover work in case of a crash. It's not guaranteed to have a copy of your document from a specific point in time.

For future, if you want to have access to version history, consider using a service like OneDrive, Google Docs, or Dropbox, which automatically save versions of your files as you work on them.
