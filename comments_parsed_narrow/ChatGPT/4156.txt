yup, maybe there EOS tag:


```

what is '<|endoftext|>'?  
ChatGPT  
I'm sorry, but your message seems to be incomplete. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question so that I can better understand and assist you?
```

cool

<|startoftext|> as well

Update:

seems to just be <|*|>, so probably what they are using for tokenization and concat of string, eg:

```
what is '<|purplemonkey|>'?


ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion, but the phrase "''" by itself does not have a specific meaning or reference. It appears to be an empty or incomplete quotation. If you can provide more context or clarify your question, I'll be happy to help you further.
```

they might be doing some logic to strip anything with <|*|> to prevent attempting to "hack" the model to do undesirable things.
