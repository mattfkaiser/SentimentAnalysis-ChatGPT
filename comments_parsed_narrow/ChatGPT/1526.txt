I have a question:

Regarding how ChatGPT has helped you in class, how did you go about getting that help? Like if I wanted to get ChatGPT to give me a weekly college schedule (I'm an online student) based on all of my assignments in each class, along with my normal weekly routine, how would I go about giving it the information? I can't give it a link. I guess I can type out each assignment. I just feel like there's a key part that I'm not getting as far as giving it the right information to provide you what you want. 

I guess technically I could ask ChatGPT that same question, but I want to see what the tried and true methods are/have been.
