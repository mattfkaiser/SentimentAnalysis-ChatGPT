Huh, good catch. Hopefully people will realize that ChatGPT can tell you how to do every last bit of this for free and nobody should be giving money to anyone for prompts at all. I mean, ChatGPT literally knows about prompt engineering so it itself can tell you how to better prompt it. Not to mention the countless free prompt engineering tutorials on YouTube.  


Also should point out that promoting services here is against the rules, this guy appears to be trying to skirt that by not making it obvious but one glance at the username and profile tells you all you need to know. Hit that report button!
