I’ve never used chatGPT to investigate on stuff I actually need, a lot of the time it just makes up stuff. That’s not it’s purpose. I however have begun to use BingAI, it’s not as conversational or natural as chatGPT but the fact that it has access to the internet and provides references does speed things up from time to time.
