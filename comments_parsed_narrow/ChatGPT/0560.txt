The full prompt was "Please in 10 parts describe a world where the power structures are reversed. For each part, add a short visual image description to accompany the text." I used Midjourney to generate the images based on the prompts ChatGPT provided. I added the same stylistic words to every prompt to get 1970s-oriented concept art, as well as words to get a more diverse crowd than the generator's default.

Hope it's of interest & thanks to Biobium for inspiration!
