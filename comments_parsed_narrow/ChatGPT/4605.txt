I am Public Fire Safety Educator. I have found plenty of uses:

1. I schedule out my social media posts at the beginning of each month. I usually post a picture, and have a relevant post with it. Instead of composing 10 unique posts myself, I give ChatGPT the topic and a description of each of the photos. Saves me a lot of time and effort. 

2. I use it to proofread important emails to business owners or other stakeholders. 

3. I have been drafting a Guide for Business owners on our Fire Codes. I used it to create an outline that covers important topics to my jurisdiction and those found in the International Fire Code. Itâ€™s been a big help in much of the content as well.
