I predict that a lot of people will use it for this purpose not because ChatGPT is so much better than an actual therapist but because, at least in the US with its dysfunctional healthcare system but also in a lot of other places, getting access to a therapist isn't very easy or accessible, whereas ChatGPT is free to use by anyone.
