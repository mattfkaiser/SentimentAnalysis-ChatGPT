From what I’m reading here, it seems like chatgpt is only as good as the information you put in. I don’t see it right now giving your prompts to help identify issues, probing for my information that a trained profession would do. 

You’re paying not only for their expertise in regurgitating information, but also the skills to help assist you and hold you accountable by being that other party. 

Chatgpt is essentially an assistant, but it can’t necessarily care for you on its own nor will it unless you feed it the probably sequences.
