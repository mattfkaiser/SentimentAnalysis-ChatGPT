I mainly use it for help when coding my Shopify store. I'm a Business Analyst and work with developers on the daily, so I talk to ChatGPT the same way:

So that

**For example:**

As a Shopify store owner who is new to Shopify and just starting to learn Liquid programming  
I want to be able to show an estimated shipping date on my product page using a custom liquid block that adds two days to today's date  
So that my customers have a good idea for when they can expect me to ship the item to them

**The result:**

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an example of how you can create a custom Liquid block that adds two days to today's date to show an estimated shipping date on your product page:

1. In your Shopify admin panel, go to "Online Store" and click on "Themes".
2. Find the theme that you're using and click on "Actions" > "Edit code".
3. In the "Templates" folder, find the file for your product page (usually called "product.liquid") and open it.
4. Find the section of the code where you want to display the estimated shipping date. This could be in the product description, in a custom section, or in a separate block altogether.
5. Add the following Liquid code to create a custom block that adds two days to today's date:

&#8203;

    {% assign shipping_date = "now" | date: "%s" | plus: 172800 | date: "%m/%d/%Y" %} {% comment %} "now" is today's date, expressed as a Unix timestamp. "plus: 172800" adds 2 days (in seconds) to the timestamp. "%m/%d/%Y" formats the timestamp as a date string. {% endcomment %} 

1. Now you can use the shipping\_date variable to display the estimated shipping date in your chosen section of the product page. For example:

&#8203;

    <p>Estimated shipping date: {{ shipping_date }}</p> 

1. Save your changes and preview your product page to see the estimated shipping date in action.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
