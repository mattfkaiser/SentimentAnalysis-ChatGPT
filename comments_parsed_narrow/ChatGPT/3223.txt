Its not just ChatGPT. We are living in historic times. We are witnessing the creation of the mind. Companies are just pushing all this stuff out to the public, which is kind of insane and because of capitalism we're going to see AI in tons of devices. They're going to be networked. It will be an insane way to create a mind. ChatGPT while not AGI already has super human knowledge. We're going to see more and more superhuman AIs in different realms.
