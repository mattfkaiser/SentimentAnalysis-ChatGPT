Maybe I don't understand everything but I think your company is making big mistake.

Instead of trying to use new open source models (which are emerging right now) to create a unique solution for their clients, your company is basically willing to become just another ChatGPT API wrapper deliverer, who are completely dependent on OpenAI.

Your company is going to bankrupt in the near future.
