A useful ChatGPT is one that can answer questions that I can't figure out.

If I'm not smart enough to come up with the answer myself, how will I be smart enough to judge the reliability of the answer?

At some point will just trust it. Not that it always gives the right answer, just that it does better than anyone else and that's enough.
