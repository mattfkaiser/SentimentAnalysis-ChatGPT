Sent out this chatGPT after my first date in 2 years:

On a scale of 1-10, how much did you enjoy your time with me tonight?

Did you think I was funny, charming, or both? (Circle one)

If our date was a movie, what genre would it be?

Did you notice any weird habits of mine? If so, please describe.

On a scale of "no way" to "absolutely," how likely are you to want to see me again?

Did you find my puns to be a) hilarious, b) mildly amusing, c) cringeworthy, or d) all of the above?

Did you feel any chemistry between us? Or was it more like a science experiment?

Would you describe our date as a) smooth sailing, b) a bit rocky, or c) a complete shipwreck?

What was your favorite moment of the date?

If you could sum up our date in one word, what would it be?
