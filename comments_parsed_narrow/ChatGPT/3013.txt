Kind of mad. Chat gpt censoring is rapidly reducing its ability to work on complex tasks. For instance I have now started seeing “I am just an AI language model and this programming task is beyond my abilities” messages that previously would have simply given an often successful go at it. Relying on the chat gpt api is a good way for your app to spontaneously stop working as abilities go away.
