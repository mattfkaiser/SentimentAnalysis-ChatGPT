I feel ya when it comes to spam content… yeah it is getting outta hand… all the genuine talented people are gradually being pushed aside for people who just use an AI program to do it. Now yeah I like dicking around with ChatGPT in order like to say oh write me a poem in the style of Edgar Allen Poe talking about WW1. but at the same time… 

Yeah I feel like instead of using it for good we are going to see an increased amount of AI generated shorts, fake Clickbait photos, scams, and just pushing genuine human creativity to the wayside since well “AI can do it better”

Yeah not all the time… John Henry much ( yeah I know it’s fiction but hey in this day and age we need a tale like that but dealing with AI)
