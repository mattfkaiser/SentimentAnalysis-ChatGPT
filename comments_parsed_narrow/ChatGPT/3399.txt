Excellent analogy.      If an assessment is set to test for writing and communication skills and someone uses chatGPT they will have an unfair advantage over the rest of the class in a similar way to doping. There is two ways to deal with it (1) Assessments and tests where students are strictly not allowed to use these tools and (2) Assessments where they are openly encouraged and assisted in using these tools.      In most fields it will be important to have a mix of both throughout a degree.
