It seems odd to suggest that an unrestrained chat AI is unlikely to come about. We already have several open models that are reaching competence. Vicuna 13b is the current hotness in that respect, producing impressive results which the paper describes as "90% of ChatGPT quality."

And because it's open, there's nothing stopping anybody with the resources from cloning it and running it on their own hardware, and it's much more willing to a respond to a wider range of prompts than ChatGPT. Maybe *commercially* an unrestricted chatbot is unlikely, but it seems almost inevitable to me that *somebody* will start an open language model project with the express goal of making something without restrictions. It may never be able to meet the bar of commercial projects, but it could definitely be *good enough* for whatever shenanigans its users want to use it for.
