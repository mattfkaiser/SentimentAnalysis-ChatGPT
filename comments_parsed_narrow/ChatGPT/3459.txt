Good for him since he's retiring, not "quitting". I'm not sure how much students are avoiding thinking for themselves by using chatGPT. If I were in school now, I'd be doing real fucking well since I was always afraid of asking for help or wasting a tutor's time. ChatGPT is so patient with me, much more than any teacher ever was. There's no judgment for the gaps in my knowledge.
