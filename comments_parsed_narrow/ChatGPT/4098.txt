I could be way off but my 2 cents: The issue with jobs and ChatGPT is that it does low end work well enough to make entry level positions or low paying internships more scarce. A lot of the work you would have delegated to less experienced workers can be accomplished quickly with this AI in the hands of an expert. I’m thinking of coding, editing, translations, etc. There’s no way ChatGPT can replace even mildly experienced people but those jobs where people gain experience and train through pretty low-skill work that’s delegated - “grunt work” so to speak - can be prompted by someone who knows what they’re doing pretty easily. This could be an issue if people don’t get those valuable junior roles anymore and all we have is experienced workers that are not being renewed by the next generation.

That said, there’s an argument to be made that companies will only use this increased productivity to create more growth and more jobs.
