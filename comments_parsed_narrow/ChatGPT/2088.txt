Why does no one provide any evidence to support these claims when they make these posts? I have never had ChatGPT refuse any request. As part of my job, I talked to it for nearly an hour having it talk to me about how it gathers information from the web, whether it uses SEO, how it fact checks itself, etc. I have no way of knowing whether any of the info is accurate, but it never once refused or pushed back. 

My takeaway is that people making these posts either have no idea how to write a prompt or they're intentionally writing controversial prompts.
