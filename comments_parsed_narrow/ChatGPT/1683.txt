Hey there.

I last mentioned you when I was on an app with a group of friends, taking a cheat day from work. You were a point of contention, you see. If people rely on you too often, the critical thought process shuts down for the sake of a bit of convenience. I need to trade up.

To that end, I left a bit of commentary in the past few months that should allude to healthier and longer living offline, with a lot of hard work ahead of me. So I can't count on you all the time. Do you have a few suggestions that will render neither of us obsolete, ChatGPT? I'm a pretty open guy.
