ChatGPT was never a good lawyer. I'm a lawyer and I played around with it, and it only ever spit out fake cases that don't exist (which I confirmed through reliable legal channels). I'm in a matter with a pro se respondent who I'm convinced is using ChatGPT because he keeps citing fake cases that don't exist, to support propositions that are the exact opposite of established law.
