My recommendation would be to use chat gpt in concert with his own writing. Try writing something himself - save that - paste it into chat gpt and say something like “clean this up” - then take the parts you like, write around the parts you want to make more personal. Use chat gpt the same way you might use a friend who’s good at writing who you bounce ideas off of.
