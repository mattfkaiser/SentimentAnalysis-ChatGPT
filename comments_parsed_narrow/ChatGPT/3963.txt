Interestingly, it has been argued that [time is an object](https://aeon.co/essays/time-is-not-an-illusion-its-an-object-with-physical-size)! 

Fascinating perspective. To attempt to summarize: things which are organized have a temporal size, that is, how much time was required to make the occurrence reasonably possible out of the unfathomable range of possibilities. The resulting configurations are so astronomically improbable that in the whole universe they would probably never occur by pure chance, but can occur through chains of evolutionary processes. This is a type of complexity we see all around us as life and in many of our human created structures.

ChatGPT itself has a physical temporal size in that model. It literally takes up time to exist, not just space. It _literally_ takes time to become more sophisticated.
