FYI those damn recipe webpages that include the author's bio from the moment of their conception, do it to reduce page bounce from google, and boost their SEO.

They also do it to get more google ads placements, as you scroll through the bulllshit and are bombarded with static ads, video ads, popups, etc.

Can you imagine how it is for poor grandma who doesn't even have a pop-up blocker installed?

She wants a recipe for oatmeal, then spends 2 hours trying to get out of one of these doorways to hell.

So, ironically, the pages with the most bulllshit content on them get boosted to the top of google, as people wade through the bullshit.

I imagine using chat gpt to parse the google results will have major implications for google's ad revenue.
