>As a teacher the mentality isnâ€™t stupid. 

It's not stupid; it's just an archaic way to view 'learning.'

Being a teacher sucks when, quite honestly, there are resources on the Internet, easily accessible, that will pretty much always be a better learning supplement than any class or lecture you can provide. Somebody else, somewhere, likely has done it better than you and likely has posted it on the Internet. Sorry to say.

Maybe classes aren't the best way for students to learn anymore? Perhaps we should encourage a more exploratory, less instructed/guided approach to learning?

There's a lot out there for people to learn, far beyond whatever a common curriculum might hope to provide. Learning should be a more active process than merely being graded points on a regurgitated, closed-note assignment done in a dark room with no guidance that merely tests rote memorization of information.

ChatGPT being used to cheat learning? Not quite; it's quite easy to test active learning if you were able to create an engaging classroom environment. With the ways schools are set up though and the world we live in? No chance in hell. Classrooms are too overcrowded, in general, and the pressure to succeed will always outweigh the desire to learn.

I'm on the side of education needing to be restructured from the ground up to account for the technology we have today. I felt that way when I was in high school all the way until I completed my Bachelor's. Education should serve to help us learn about the world around us, not teach us how to adapt to a world that only exists within academia as a way to grade us and evaluate our worth to society.
