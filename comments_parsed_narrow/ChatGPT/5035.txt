I don't know what the real justification is for OpenAI not working on or at least claiming to not work on GPT-5. I think it's because they want to see what possibilities are yet to be discovered with GPT-4. I don't think AI is at a plateau, just look at things like AutoGPT. I don't think the solution to AGI is just training bigger and bigger LLMs rather it's one piece of what will eventually become AGI.

I can easily see a model that has better vision based reasoning implemented in a similar way as PaLM-SayCan approach a humanoid robot with AGI. Integrating LLMs, robotics, and diffusion models can possibly produce something incredible that's way beyond current AI capabilities. The development roadmap to such things is not inconceivable starting with what we have available todays.

And touching on your comment about job losses. I already described why I think there is still a lot of room for improvement but even without those, I think you're thinking of job losses the wrong way. The concern isn't that AI will outright replace jobs, as in someone would "hire" an AI instead of a person (although that's already happening, I personally used ChatGPT instead of hiring a lawyer for example). It's more like now 1 person with AI can do the job of 10. When we have better local AIs that eliminate the safety concern of sending sensitive data over the internet the reduction of demand for human labor will be even greater. I'm personally not too concerned about all this. There will definitely be an adjustment period but to think of this as just "less jobs" is probably misguided. AI isn't just available to employers it's available to everyone, thus AI lowers the barrier to entry for people to start their own projects and businesses. Calling this a new industrial revolution is more appropriate.
