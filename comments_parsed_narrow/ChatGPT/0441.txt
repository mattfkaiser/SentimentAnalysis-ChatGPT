I think this is actually a pretty good use of chat gpt. Helping with the catharsis of closure is good. 

However, a word of warning. Don't do this for the living. 

I once used gpt I  a similar role. However, I was trying to prepare for a hard conversation with my sister. I wanted chat gpt to give me possible reader interpretations of what I was saying so that I wouldn't adversely say something that could be taken the wrong way.

After the practice, I noticed that gpt had helped me achieve catharsis, and I didn't feel the need to talk to my sister about it anymore. 

But the conversation didn't happen, I never told my sister how I felt. I missed a real opportunity to have this talk with my sister.
