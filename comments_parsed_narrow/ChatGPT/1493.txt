I get your point. You’re saying double check your sources especially around legal. My 3 points:
1. Duh. Like, duh. Obviously. Checking your sources isn’t new to chatgpt. If you’re digitally literate, this should be native to you.
2. It sounds like the lawyers in your example are clearly not digitally literate. 
3. In my opinion, your comment is more about instilling fear and caution about AI, but you failed to get your point across. “You really need to watch out” and “ai is known to hallucinate” and “a couple of lawyers got in trouble” really drive the cautionary ai narrative home. 

You might have said this instead “remember, all the rules from the Google internet era still apply, like double and triple checking your sources. I think it’s easy to forget about them because ai can be so personable and believable but at this time we must still validate our sources to ensure we’re learning credible information”
