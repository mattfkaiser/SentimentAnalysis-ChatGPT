I have the plus version, and Iâ€™ve been using lots of hours lately to code JavaScript node+expressjs that I host online in order to automate  api calling, and treating information.

I find liberating that Chad GPT is helping me with JavaScript coding to create or consume custom endpoints. 

However, I am reading hear that OP is doing something even better than coding in javascript ? Is there a video YouTube that explains coding in Chat GPT plug-ins ?
