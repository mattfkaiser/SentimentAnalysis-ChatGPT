Isn't it proof enough that so many people who have been using GPT4 since its release have noticed a quality difference, particularly those who use it daily?

Since GPT4's public release, I've been using it, and I've noticed that the text-writing quality has decreased.

My GPT4 has become significantly faster but also dumber. It's like I am using a GPT4-turbo version or something. It took a long time to get responses back then, but the quality was much higher.

I've written old articles entirely with GPT4 and very specific prompts. I see a significant difference when I compare the output from back then with the output from today. No, I am using the exact same prompts.

GPT4 was initially exceptionally good at understanding the instructions and guidelines I provided in order to achieve a particular writing style. Currently, it can only roughly understand my writing prompts, and it seems more like GPT4 is switching between writing style templates like Quillbot.

You might not notice the difference if you only use ChatGPT to make memes...
