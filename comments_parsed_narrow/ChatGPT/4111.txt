You have to understand, it'll take time for banks, insurance companies etc to investigate ChatGPT and AI in general, perform risk assessments, upskill employees on how to use it and integrate it. Many big companies have systems that are basically polish turds, on the outside to the customer, the software looks amazing, but on the backend, it's a hodgepodge of old, outdated legacy systems, barely held together with duct tape. It's going to take time for companies to work through these issues. Once they do though, I honestly think a lot of people will be made redundant, not necessarily because entire jobs can be made redundant, but a 30% increase in efficiency is 30% reduction in headcount.
