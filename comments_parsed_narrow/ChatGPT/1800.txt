I asked ChatGPT:

AI for Funeral Speech

Model: GPT-4

User
Is it unethical to have ChatGPT write a letter for my dad, who just passed, that I'll read at the funeral. I was close to my dad and everything, but I mean, the result is just so much better than anything I could ever write.

I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

Regarding your question, ethics often depends on context and individual interpretation, but generally speaking, it's not inherently unethical to use an AI like ChatGPT to help you write a letter, speech, or any piece of communication. AI is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used to help us in various tasks, including writing.

However, it's important to remember that the value in a letter or a speech, especially in such an emotional and personal context, often comes not from the eloquence or sophistication of the writing, but from the authenticity and sincerity of the emotions conveyed. It's the personal touch, the stories, and the genuine feelings that truly connect with others.

If you feel that ChatGPT can help you better articulate your feelings and thoughts, then by all means, you can use it as a tool to assist you. You might consider using it to help get started, provide structure, or polish the language, but filling the letter with your own personal memories, emotions, and sentiments about your father is what will make it truly meaningful.

Remember, it's your thoughts and feelings about your dad that matter most. It's perfectly okay to seek help in articulating them, but be sure to keep the heart of the message your own.
