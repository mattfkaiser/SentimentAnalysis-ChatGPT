No, not everyone can or wants to write in such moment. But what you can do is feed Chatgpt with the ideas, memories, feelings, anecdotes that you want to be on this letter. This will help the letter to be specifically about your dad. Chatgpt is a tool, and in this case it can help to give better form to a lot of feelings, ideas, memories that you have or that will come when you start writing them.
