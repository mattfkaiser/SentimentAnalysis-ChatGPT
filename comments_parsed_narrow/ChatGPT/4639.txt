I wonder what it can achieve if I merge it with this one: [https://github.com/ReminisApp/websearch-chatgpt-plugin](https://github.com/ReminisApp/websearch-chatgpt-plugin)  


It uses Google Search. But when I select two plugins it didn't go anywhere near agentGPT.  


It's more useful than autogpt and more usable and more powerful than agentGPT if we can combine both.  


It can create git repos push code, write code and even publish using command line tools.
