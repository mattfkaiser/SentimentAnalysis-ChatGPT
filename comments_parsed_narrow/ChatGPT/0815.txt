>I went to the gym a few days ago and noticed I had some extreme soreness/stiffness. I started typing my symptoms into ChatGPT 4.0 with internet access, and it mentioned this crazy thing called rhabdomyolysis. However, it said my pee should be brown or red. So, I continued my morning like normal until finally, I had to pee. Sure enough, it turned the toilet a Coca Cola color.

>I told my girlfriend, and she begged me to go to the hospital. I didn't want to, but finally caved in. When I arrived at the ER, they immediately ran blood and urine tests. They told me I'll be here for a while because my CK levels were at 50,000 (normal is 40-190). This chemical is extremely toxic to the kidneys and could've killed me if I hadn't come in when I did (according to the doctor).

>On the second day, my CK went up to 61,500, and yesterday it went down to 54,000 (they did an ultrasound showing no organ damage). It’s 12:45 am right now, and they’ll take my blood in the next few hours. Hopefully, it'll be even lower, and I'll be closer to going home and being safe. I was extremely scared (still am, to be honest).

>I’m 19, and I don't understand how I got here. I feel like I'm always very cautious when exercising, but I guess I pushed myself too hard. I’ll update in the morning after I get my labs back. I’m extremely lucky to have this amazing woman by my side through this entire process. She’s currently on her phone right next to me in a very uncomfortable chair. She’s been here every second of the way for me, and I hope to marry her someday.

>My family and friends have been visiting, which is really nice. Sorry if I’m venting; I just kinda needed it. If my post is allowed here, I’ll update in the morning with my CK levels.
