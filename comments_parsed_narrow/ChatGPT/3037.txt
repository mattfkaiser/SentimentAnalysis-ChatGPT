Not really shocked by this one to be honest.  You're a small ML team for a smaller company, you can't possibly compete with a company entirely dedicated to AI development.  Your job was toast the day you were working in house on AI instead of the company rolling it's an own AI company from scratch and growing it as AI to compete with OpenAI and others.

You're job isn't even just in jeopardy from ChatGPT, it's in jeopardy by the entire open source community, because the open source community is actually out pacing OpenAI and creating a plethora of other AI's that are even better than ChatGPT.   We have text to music, text to video, text to image, text to documentation, and on and on AI's out or coming out in the open source community.

Why on earth are you working for that company?  You should be working for Open AI, Stability AI, or any of the other plethora of AI dedicated companies.

You sound like you've worked there for a while and aren't with the modern job change era.  Start looking for a job right now aligned with your skills and LEAVE.
