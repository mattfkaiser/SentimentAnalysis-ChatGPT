You have to be really specific with your prompts for Chat GPT to be accurate. I used it for my college essays the past two semesters, but you have to be very specific with it. I usually put my on spin on what it generates instead of just copying and pasting. My last essay I used it on I got a 88 percent so it works pretty well if youâ€™re exact with your prompts.
