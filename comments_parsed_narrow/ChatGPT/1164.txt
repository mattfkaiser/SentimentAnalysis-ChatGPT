>  responding to bullshit emails professionally when you're annoyed

This.  This is so incredibly useful for me. I get hung up, repeating myself to clients, trying to find new ways to say the same thing I've already told them 3 times. It's not in my personality to be dealing with it, takes me forever, and causes me a TON of stress. 

I've now trained chatgpt on my business, and I input my previous emails, the client response, and what my goals are for the project completion.   Chatgpt gives me a professional email with an even tone and direct call to action.  Done in 5 mins.  No stress. Then I can go on about my day doing the actual work instead of just talking about it.
