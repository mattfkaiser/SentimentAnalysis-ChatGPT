Of course you can find a guide online for making a bomb, but the power of an AI agent isn’t regurgitating published information, it’s the ability to reason based on published information and adapt to different situations. An AI that understands electronics, organic chemistry, thermodynamics, and material science at even an undergraduate level can make a much more sophisticated bomb than what you’d find in the anarchist’s cookbook. And it would be able to answer questions like “I can’t get this chemical, which less regulated chemical can I use instead?” or “help me calculate the yield of this bomb and tell me where to best place it to do the most damage to a building, bridge, or highway overpass”

Is it possible to find all of this information on the internet and textbooks? Yes, but putting it into action would be a lot of work and you’d need to learn a lot of terminology to find the information you need and apply it correctly and not blow yourself up… Also, searching for this information in an overt way would raise a lot of alarms vs. running a model offline where you could keep your searches hidden. Yes, TOR and DuckDuckGo exist, but not everyone knows about them and it’s a pain to actually keep yourself 100% hidden. 

Right now, I can accomplish things I would not have been able to do without ChatGPT (or months of study/practice), these are all positive things, but it’s important to consider that these models could empower people to do very negative things that they otherwise would not have been able to do too…
