I don't think it has anything to do with lacking imagination.

I work directly with clients, talking to them live. ChatGPT can't automate my job, and in most instances, I wouldn't use it to ghostwrite an email because it won't sound like me or have the personal touches I can add - and in the time it takes to have it write one and revise it, I could have just written it myself. And in fact, it CAN'T write an email for me most of the time because usually I'm discussing our specific product which it has no knowledge of anyways.

Have I used it for certain things? Yes. Do I find it useful? Sure. EXTREMELY useful? Meh. I haven't paid the $20 to try plugins yet, but I could see the plugins having a lot more potential uses.

There are plenty of jobs/tasks where using ChatGPT isn't all that helpful or useful at all.
