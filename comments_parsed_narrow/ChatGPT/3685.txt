I would recommend asking ChatGPT to act as a therapist trained in the principles and strategies of cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy. Iâ€™ve found that the responses it gives me with those parameters in place are uniformly targeted, specific, and useful. When it devolves into giving a list of general advice, I drill down on one of the more useful avenues of response and ask for elaboration, examples, and recommendations. (It will actually lead you through identifying cognitive distortions and reframing your experiences in more constructive ways.)
