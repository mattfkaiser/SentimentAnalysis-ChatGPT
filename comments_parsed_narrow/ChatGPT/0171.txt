I asked chatgpt to write a comment for me to respond to your post:

Its great that he took the time to address all the points on your profile and strike up a conversation, but using a language model to generate responses instead of engaging in a genuine conversation can be disappointing. It's important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, even if it takes a little more energy. Hopefully, he can learn from this experience and improve his communication skills in the future.
