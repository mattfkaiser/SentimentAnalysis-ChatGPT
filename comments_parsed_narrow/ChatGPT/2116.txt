Agreed.  More work is not what anyone doing the work wants.  A recent episode of "The Indicator" from Plant Money briefly discussed an MIT study that found adding AI for Call Center reps increased their productivity but not for those with a ton of experience.  The new hires were impacted the most.  Meaning AI could upskill a lot of workers.  So not meaning more work but changing the quality or type of work possible.  Taken a few steps further that could mean a whole lot of people who weren't as effective in the workforce before AI can be extremely effective because they don't have to have those skills, education or experience while AI is part of the job.

That's a rosy picture though.  ChatGPT and other AI programs still lie and invent "facts" so OP needs to be very very careful with the data and recommendations given by AI.
