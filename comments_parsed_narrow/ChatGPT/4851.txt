It’s story telling capabilities are really fun! Be it fan fiction, or totally made up. My son had the two stuff animals I always do voices for. We’ve been doing it for years. They have names and have really developed into full fledged characters over the years. 

I told chatgpt all the deets and said write a quick story about “Flip and Flynn” and now we have nothing short of a Saturday morning cartoon waiting to happen based on characters my son and I created 8 years ago haha. I love the story aspect of this.
