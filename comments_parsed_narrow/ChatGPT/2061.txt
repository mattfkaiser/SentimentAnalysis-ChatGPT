I tried to have it give me a pun for a birthday card involving plant diseases for a coworker who does research with them.

ChatGPT informed me it couldn't do that because it's insensitive and agriculture/food security are not matters to be taken lightly. Reloaded a response and reframed the question and got similar output

I thought it was the typical 'anti-woke' crowd complaining about censorship, but there's some weird restrictions.

Edit: Input prompt was "Give me a happy birthday pun related to plant diseases"

Generated responses were a variant of "I'm sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. Using plant diseases as a basis for a birthday pun could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate, as it could trivialize the impact of plant diseases on agriculture and food security." 

Obviously you can work around it but it still was giving this reply.
