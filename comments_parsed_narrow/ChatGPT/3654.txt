The responses a therapist gives initially ARE pretty formulaic. They’re investigating nonjudgmentally and learning whats going on. They’re analyzing the patient’s situation. Helping someone understand their situation is not simple, so it’s worth it to collect a lot of information. They have no idea what they’re stepping into. Does the patient have trauma? Does the patient self harm? Is the patient suicidal, depressed, anxious, have a serious psychological disorder, currently being abused, under threat to their physical well being, trans or queer, repressing memories, eating in a disordered way, abusing someone else, have ptsd etc etc etc. 

What chatGPT won’t do is make a lot of notes and understand patterns in behavior and cognition, and it won’t make the connections a good therapist will. Therapy takes time to be productive, it is not a quick fix. 

I totally believe chatgpt can mimic a first session therapist easily, but that does not make it a therapist.
