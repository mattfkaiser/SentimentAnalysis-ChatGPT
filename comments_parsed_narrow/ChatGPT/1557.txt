Glad that things are working great for you! I'm still trying to tweak my prompts that helps ChatGPT explain things to me in the most best way possible that's suited for me. For example, I'm making ChatGPT use slang, videogame analogies, and many other hyper specific types and ways of communications. I know I shouldn't rely on ChatGPT to do everything for me, but I'm just struggling a lot mentally right now that's harming people. I know it doesn't have any emotions, but man it helps me organize my thoughts and I feel heard while acknowledging why some of my negative thoughts and behaviors are bad. But then they suggest actionable things that can help out with my negative behavior.

I'm also struggling with information overload, and I'll try to see if I can make ChatGPT reorganize my syllabus! If you have any more educational tips besides the ones that you have posted below, please feel free to let me know!
