I am a programmer at a large tech company, a heavy user of chatGPT in my spare time, and I have also written applications that use the API. I'd say I have more experience with it and understanding of how it works than the vast majority of the people who use it.

I would still mark chatGPT as "somewhat useful". It makes a lot of mistakes and its output has to be double and triple checked.
