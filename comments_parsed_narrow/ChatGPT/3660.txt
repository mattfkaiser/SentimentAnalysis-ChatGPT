Absolutely!  It's a game changer.  Now, there is no calling my insurance for a list of providers, going through the list one at a time to find one that is taking new patients.  No going to the first therapist to see if we are a good fit for each other.  If we're not, there's not starting over from step 2 of this process.  There is no arguing with my insurance company about what's covered and what's not.  No.  

I open a window, I hit the microphone button, and I say the exact thing I would say to a therapist.  I get back a response that is often more logical, coherent, helpful, and even more empathetic and understanding than any other experience I've ever had with a human mental health worker.  

Why would I want to go back to the old way, if this thing is only going to improve over time, and it's already better for most everyday situations.  Also, I can't just call my therapist 24/7 every time some little thing goes wrong.  But chatGPT is always there, wide awake and ready to give the same CONSISTENT advice, because they don't have a bad day, have to deal eith the struggle of life, don't get annoyed or bothered.  They are always there, professionally waiting for me to ask it a question.  Will there still be humans doing some mental health moving forward.  Sure, but the industry as a whole is about to take a huge hit by this tech, for better or worse.
