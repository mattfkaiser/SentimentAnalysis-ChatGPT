For usages like number 3, I always start a new chat after I'm done oversharing.

Just like I do with real life: Moving out of the city, erasing my identity and changing my name because I overshared at the nightclub at 3 AM again.

Jokes aside, yes! I always start a new chat for mental health related subjects because ChatGPT tends to get easily overwhelmed when not dealing with subjects that are easy to fact-check. And it will start to generate output that mixes up stories.

In example: I shared two scenarios about 2 guys and I couldn't for the life of me make it understand the difference between the two guys, it was hilarious   


Aaaaaand I need a life....
