Yea it’s weird. I even threw the post’s chatGPT response  into chatGPT asking what the tone was to make sure I wasn’t reading it in a sensitive way.

To psychoanalysis the commenters a bit, they probably communicate in a similar way (online and in real life) and are self conscious that they are perceived to be condescending. So now they’re trying to argue against that idea to preserve their ego.
