God. Tell me about it. Most peoples ChatGPT threads are a single prompt and response and then they go with the first thing it shits out and never hit the refresh button to resend the prompt and get a new output. They never say "That's on the right track, but rewrite it, changing X, Y and Z blah blah". People treating ChatGPT like it's a fucking oracle and it's actually intelligent (it isn't) pisses me off. Everyone's like "Wow, this shit doesn't work." Yeah? Because you didn't use it right! You bought into the hype and let the internet memes convince you it was SkyNet. It's a brain damaged four-year-old with an inexplicably huge vocabulary and access to the pre-2022 internet.
