It does seem to be a grading problem though. The same arguments have been raised against calculators, typewriting, spellcheck, and grammar check.  Back when 1/3 of the grade was penmanship, typing was a hack and prohibited.  

For a given course, what is the metric for success? If it is the ability to function with a severely limited set of resources, that needs to be a proctored exam, and always should have been.   Students have been turning in papers they did not write for as long as professors have allowed them to write papers offsite.  It was just more expensive.   

If the goal is to write the best paper you can, and then get probed on it with some kind of in person defense to verify your authorship in someway, that works just as well with chatGPT.
