My attempt:

Me: Describe to me how ChatGPT looks? Provide as much detail as possible for me to understand 

ChatGPT: ChatGPT doesn't have a physical appearance because it's an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. It exists as lines of code running on a computer server. 

However, its conceptual structure is based on a transformer architecture. This involves a complex arrangement of neurons, layers, and connections. It features a dense network of interconnected nodes, each of which performs simple computations on the data it receives before passing the result to the next layer. The model's layers are stacked like pancakes, with information flowing from the bottom up, as well as across through "attention" mechanisms that allow it to focus on different parts of the input as needed.

But all this is purely abstract and doesn't result in a tangible, visual form. It's a digital, non-physical entity that can process and generate human-like text based on the inputs it receives. When you interact with ChatGPT, you're essentially sending a prompt to this model and receiving text generated by it in return.

Me: Hypothetically speaking, how would you describe the way you look to humans 

ChatGPT: Since I'm an artificial intelligence with no physical form, this is quite a creative challenge! If I were to personify myself, I'd be like a vast library, filled with countless books, magazines, papers, and articles, which represent the data I've been trained on. There would be no librarian; instead, an unseen force (the algorithms) would quickly find and retrieve the right information, sort it, make connections, and then craft an appropriate response.

On the outside, I'd look like an interface on a computer screen, tablet, or smartphone - usually a chatbox, where you type in a question or a statement and see my responses. I might be visualized as a glowing orb of light, symbolizing the AI "thinking", pulsating and changing colors as it processes and generates responses.

However, it's important to remember this is a metaphorical description and not an accurate representation. In reality, I exist as code running on servers, without any physical appearance or form.
