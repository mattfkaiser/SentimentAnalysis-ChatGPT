The german is fine I suppose. The content stays the same but it's not a direct translation. If I were ro translate it back I would translate it as "For me all of this is greek". That's a pretty accurate translation with only one tiny syntax change. It's all greek to me would be "Es ist alles griechisch für mich" which is a word to word translation with no syntax change only one grammar change to (zu) was replaced by for (für). GPT can translate german well but not if you want an extremely accurate translation.
Edit: looked at comments and realized this is an idiom for when you don't understand something. In german ,you would say "Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof" in english "I only understand train station". So yeah ChatGPT apparently doesn't care about idioms or doesn't know them.
