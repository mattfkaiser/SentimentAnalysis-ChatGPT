I know this post is for the lulz, *but* I am also concerned by the numbers of comments trying to deduce how / why ChatGPT arrived at 4 *mathematically* or *algorithmically*, when we definitively know it doesn't have that ability.

Reminder that ChatGPT does not actually possess a random number generator (or pseudorandom number generator) or e.g., code execution capabilities… at least in the general models.  It doesn't have any genuine form of randomness — besides the fact that the ChatGPT responses themselves are nondeterministic — and I think that may be deluding people into having the impression that it truly does have randomness.

Major caveat though: IIRC there is a Python code interpreter plugin now, so in theory this *should* work:

```python
execute the following python code to roll a dice:

import random
random.seed()
print(random.randint(1, 6))
```

However, I tried it under *GPT-4 (Plugins)* mode though, and it failed like above.

My assumptions were:

1. GPT-4 Plugins mode pick the best underlying plugin to use

2. The *GPT-4 (Code Interpreter)* mode is one of those plug-ins

3. My impression from the blog post was that the Code Interpreter plugin basically just passes text to a Python interpreter

4. The most recent release notes said all Plus members have "Plugins" access now, but maybe that doesn't include the Code Intrepreter plugin, or I'm just doing something wrong here (???)

Hopefully this approach will work in the near future though.  And then you can probably even have ChatGPT generate the trivial "dice rolling" code.

Curious if anyone who has used the Code Intrepreter plugin can comment on that more.
