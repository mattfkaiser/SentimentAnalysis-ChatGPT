Now, I lean back and wait for the downvotes, because people can't accept that a company is in charge of how they want their AI to work.

If you dislike it so much, not you OP, but anyone, then just get a GPU with 12GB VRAM or more and download an LLM.

Takes 30 minutes or so to get everything ready with Oogabooga.
