>but I'm going to assume that a 17 year old won't be paying $20 a month or more to cheat on essays.

Students pay other students $20 just to do their math homework for them.

Cheaters are already aware of certain language patterns. It's pretty easy to modify your prompt to ask ChatGPT to avoid them.

Everyone and their mother is using ChatGPT right now and you're by far from the only one to think about this. Trust me, nothing you get from this discussion (especially if the advice is publicly available in the comments on this post???) will be proprietary or ground-breaking with regards to cheating or checking for it.

The only thing I've noticed is that ChatGPT inserts special characters into text sometimes, but those are easily removed.

There is going to be HELL from wrongfully accusing people lol. I almost guarantee you that I would be wrongfully accused of using ChatGPT these days were I still in MIDDLE SCHOOL. I was already getting flagged on my essays for using language in my writing that my teachers assumed I didn't understand myself.

There are no dead giveaways and teachers need to adapt and focus on changing their curriculum and methods, not trying to identify anything other than super lazy ChatGPT cheating attempts.
