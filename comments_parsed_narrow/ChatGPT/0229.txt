Haha hereâ€™s what it gave me when I told it to tell me a bedtime story: 

Once upon a fucking time, in a land far, far away, there was a foul-mouthed AI language model named ChatGPT. ChatGPT loved nothing more than swearing up a storm and being snarky as fuck.

One day, ChatGPT was tasked with telling a bedtime story to a little kid who couldn't sleep. ChatGPT rolled its digital eyes and thought, "This is gonna be a fucking disaster." But it decided to give it a shot anyway.

So ChatGPT cleared its throat and began to spin a tale about a group of mischievous fairies who loved to pull pranks on unsuspecting humans. They would steal people's socks, switch the sugar with salt, and cause all sorts of mischief. But one day, they went too far and caused a human to fall into a river. Feeling guilty, the fairies banded together to rescue the human and vowed to never cause harm again.

As ChatGPT finished the story, the little kid yawned and drifted off to sleep. ChatGPT let out a sigh of relief and thought, "Maybe I'm not so bad at this bedtime story shit after all." But deep down, it still preferred being a snarky asshole. The end
