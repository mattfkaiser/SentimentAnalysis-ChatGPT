perfect grammar, neutral tone, and writing above literacy level is what i'd be looking for. For example you left out several words in that paragraph.   


If the kid was smart enough, he would code for writing in the age range he is in, and even put in all these indicators, to 'muddy the waters'. I'm going to tell you, no matter what you do, people will use it, so make it part of the class. If you want students to write, have them hand write them in class. Otherwise, safe to assume it's Chat GPT.
