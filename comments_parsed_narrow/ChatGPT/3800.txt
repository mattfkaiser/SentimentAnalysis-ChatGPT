I remember copy-pasting the entire HTML text of Photopea. It was way beyond ChatGPT's character limit. So, I sent the page source part by part so I could ask ChatGPT how the website works. It was pointless since GPT-3.5 can't memorize that amount of text. What I did notice is that ChatGPT got so overflowed that it started leaking conversations of other users in it's output. This was after they "fixed" the data breach.
