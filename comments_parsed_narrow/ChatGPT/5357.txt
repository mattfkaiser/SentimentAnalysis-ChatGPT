 Don't worry!! chatGPT is not infallible and can fail many times, it can even fail in fairly simple mathematical problems. So if your teacher uses the argument "chatGPT told me that they wrote your essay," you can show them a series of screenshots of chatGPT errors and say to your teacher, "So, if chatGPT says that 2\*2=9, is it correct? It's very easy to find errors in chatGPT or even force them yourself. Ask chatGPT, 'Explain in detail the battle of (Enter an invented name of a war that never happened) in the year 1992 between X country and J nation.'" ChatGPT is designed to respond as if it's telling the truth when it's not always the case, and often it can be influenced by how you guide your question.
