I personally find ChatGPT extremely useful for work, education, or entertainment!

 ChatGPT saves me a huge amount of time and gives me very very high quality information on a huge range of topics.  What is very important, ChatGPT understands the deep essence of my questions and sees the difference.

 Yes, there are obvious ethical restrictions artificially set by the developers that often reduce the usefulness of ChatGPT responses, but in any case, this is a revolution.  I'm shocked at how useful ChatGPT is in my life - a lot of the information that ChatGPT gives me, I would either never find, or would literally spend months or years on it.

 I believe that ChatGPT is the most important invention in the history of mankind, since the invention of the Internet.
