Yeah, namely, Claude. I’m just saying it’s worth trying if people haven’t yet. The [LMSYS Leaderboard] (https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard), while obviously not conclusive, reflects my experience; Claude-instant is slightly better than “regular ChatGPT 3.5 turbo”, and is the only model to notch a 40% win-rate against GPT-4 in these comparisons. Even if that “40%” figure itself is meaningless, it’s still better than GPT 3.5’s win-rate.
