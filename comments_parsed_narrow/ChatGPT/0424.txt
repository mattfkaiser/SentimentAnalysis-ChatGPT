I like to give ChatGPT ideas I have for movies, letting it know the style I'm going for, the major characters, and the plot beats, then have it write an outline and alter the outline to add more characters, or change a decision, or incorporate more themes. Then I ask it to start writing out pages of the script and further fine tune it. It's pretty fun.
