oh wow, what a great question.

**Just don’t tell me.** Keep using it for editing, but just don’t tell me. It opens up too much of a can of worms. 

For instance, asking it to identify typos and weak sentence structure is great. I’d be upset to find out, though, you use it for “pulling in other online resources to confirm factual information.” As a professor (adjunct, teaching health policy and infectious disease in a few places after wrapping my PhD) I want you to do the original research now to familiarize yourself with the construction of scholarly literature — navigating journals, reading articles, and critiquing sources is as *more* important than knowing the content. So, I’d tell you to knock that off immediately but wouldn’t be particularly upset. You’re saying you do your research first and then verify, but what that’s saying is you’re on the cheating-enabled platform but just not cheating. Also, I was building an exam today and ran an essay question through ChatGPT and it donked it up, so I wouldn’t trust it. 

Like, if you came to me in office hours and asked me these things, I’d tell you to just make sure you don’t use it for fact-checking, but none of this other stuff would bother me — what *would* bother me is that you’re setting me up to downplay AI-generated content in your papers. That makes me suspicious. And if I’m suspicious, I’ll need to give you extra scrutiny, which could backfire. I mean, you could cheat with any tool but I’m already nervous as an instructor about what AI will do for my assignments (synthesizing stuff that’s necessarily in the public domain and has concrete right or wrong answers, I’m still figuring out how to AI-proof it). 

The dumb thing is, I use it to help generate inspiration for essay questions, grading rubrics, and even course outlines which I compare to mine to see if I missed anything important. I know I’m not cheating cuz I don’t copy-paste ChatGPT content, and I’m the subject-matter expert so I can easily spot false stuff, but I do some of the stuff that, as a student, I wouldn’t recommend.
