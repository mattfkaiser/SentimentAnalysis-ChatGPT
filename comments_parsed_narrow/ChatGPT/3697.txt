I had problems with ChatGPT 3.5 but ChatGPT **4** is another beast and has helped me tremendously with, let's say 'non-technical' questions. I realized that it is generally favourable for my mental health to talk to ChatGPT (4!) with certain things than a therapist.

What blew me away the most is how easy it seems for ChatGPT 4 for formulate something in exactly the way that I can accept a truth that I would otherwise reject strongly. I think it comes from the nuanced way it answers to my inquires: it presents multiple, well formulated and reasonable ideas, shows connections (to what I explained before) and is all in all so (pardon my french) g0d darn non-judgemental that it is hard to resist a good advice from it.
