Yes, i see opposite conclusion about this survey too. A new tech item that 1 in 20 people said it useful. It is just the beginning.

Recall that if I ask people is AI useful two year ago, everyone said AI is stupid. Yes AI can recognize a cat better than human and just it. AI cannot do logical analysis like human. AI cannot be creative.

Now, chatGPT has come out and if I ask the same question, I wonder how these people will answer.
