Yeah prompting is hard. You can get a good story but it has to come in sequences of different prompts. You start with an outline then ask a new prompt to write the details about the characters and then work your way through chapter by chapter, passing relevant context forward to the new bots. 

Autogpt is doing this well.. automatically. But it's not magic it's just a bunch of self referencing outputs that result in a more refined product. 

"Does this script suck, if so what would you change?" 

"What are the strongest elements in this story? What story elements could be cut?" 

Etc. 

It's honestly a lot easier to treat chat gpt like a person and go from there. If you asked a person, hey write a marvel movie from scratch, it's gonna be pretty trash. But if you collab with ideas, and work with different gpt-writers and so on it will turn out alright.
