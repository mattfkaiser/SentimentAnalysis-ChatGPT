I should try the prompts but there was no training of Chatgpt on how to make a midjourney prompt? The images are great but tweaking parameters, versions, styles probably would make it even better. I use --r (your choice for amount of runs) and --c (your amount of chaos) to develop a bunch of pics and then choose the best. Those pictures seem to be too nice to be received from the one word prompts and picking from the best of 4. Anyways, all of this discussion just will make us better prompt engineers. I appreciate the post and stimulation.
