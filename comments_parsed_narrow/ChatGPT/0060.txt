Sounds a bit suss…

Why panic if you did nothing wrong and it’s 100% legit?

Sounds like you probably did write some of it on your own but also copied and pasted some from Chat GPT maybe…? 

Assuming you are 100% innocent, just be calm and even offer to re-write if needed to prove it but honestly the software they use does detect patterns AI uses a lot in their responded which is why I question the OP a bit.

Either way, best of luck to you. If you’re 100% innocent, I am confident it will somehow all work out and they will apologize.

Do not escalate until absolutely necessary. The more you get hostile , the more red flags will be raised.
