Tbh it just feels as when ever a part of ChatGPT gets solid traction, it get nerfed to oblivion - and I’ll bet a fine amount that this ‘nerf’ is only made to cut out pieces of ChatGPT that can be sold as stand-alone versions of ChatGPT.


Soon you can pay for lawyer-ChatGPT, developer-ChatGPT and … why would they sell all of these for 20$/month if you can sell them individually for much more to people who will use it professionally.
