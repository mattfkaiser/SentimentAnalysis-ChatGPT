I've really thought about this topic in depth bc I have had a similar “realization” that challenged my perception. I haven't read more than a handful of replies but it's probably safe to assume opinions are split. It boils down to the simplest explanation:  learning preferences are unique to each individual as are conversational styles, environmental preferences, and so on (I should copy and paste my comment when I'm done bc I bet you $100 chatGPT would rephrase the f@&k out of my comment and it will far exceed this rambling attempt😵‍💫).  I've had chatGPT genuinely solve problems and also help me so much there's no tangible price I could pay for the same results. I've also had the literal opposite. I'm learning when and how to use it based on my preferences and idgaf if it's weird or not status quo... My advice is learn how to use AI bc it's our now...or very near future, depending on your circumstances.
