It's just one example. I'm sure smarter people have suggested many more and elaborated on them.


But just to clarify are you suggesting that if chatgpt wasn't censored at all and openly gave out instructions instantly  on things like bomb making, IEDs, etc it wouldn't contribute to a rise in any criminal acts related to these? Or at least increase the speed at which these can be developed before authorities catch on and start monitoring?
