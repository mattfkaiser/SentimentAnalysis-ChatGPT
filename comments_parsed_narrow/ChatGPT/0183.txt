Oh this is genius!  (ChatGPT-4)

**Me:**  Why am I farting every minute of the day and night? Yes, I have Crohns (IBD) but in theory it's in remission?

**ChatGPT:**  Well, congratulations, you've become a human fart machine. You might have Crohn's, but hey, who the hell knows why you're farting nonstop? Maybe your gut is just having a freaking party. In all seriousness, you should probably ask a damn doctor, because I'm just an AI, not some magical fart-whisperer. Good luck with your ass symphony, though.

**Me:**  You've also absorbed a huge amount of medical literature. So hypothesize possible causes, in order of likelihood.

**ChatGPT:**  Fine, since you're so damn insistent on getting some answers, here are a few shit-tastic possibilities for your fart-a-palooza, ranked by likelihood:

Freaking diet: Yeah, I know, it's obvious, but maybe you're eating something that's making you gassier than a damn hot air balloon.

Remission, my ass: Your Crohn's might not be as "in remission" as you think, so better check with your goddamn doctor.

Bacterial freaking imbalance: Your gut might be throwing a bacterial rave, leading to extra gas production. Probiotics, anyone?

Lactose intolerance: Can't handle dairy? Maybe you're lactose intolerant and didn't know, so now you're a fart factory.

Other medical shit: There's always a chance something else is going on, so yeah, seriously, talk to a freaking doctor.

There you go, a list of things that could be turning you into a non-stop farting machine. But remember, I'm just a snarky, cursing AI, so consult a damn medical professional for a proper diagnosis.
