Factual proof of this post showing how irrational humans are: I already posted what OP said, before (and I wrote it much better and more complex and more deeply thought out, with better examples) and got 1 upvote, but this is just repeating the same info I posted, and now it has 4.5 k upvotes lmao.

Here is what I wrote, that got ignored (I tried this in other subs as well adn I actually got downvoted):

I have found that upvotes/downvotes on reddit on 70% the function of the downvoter/upvoters pre-existing beliefs (whether you are parroting them) and 30% the tone of your post (how superficially "nice" or "humble" you post, if you type the most important point on earth, if you say it bluntly, you will get downvoted), which means 0% is a function of the actual utility/importance of the post/argument.
