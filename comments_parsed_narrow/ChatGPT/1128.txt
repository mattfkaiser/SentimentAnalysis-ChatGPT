I wasn't referring to you specifically, but more to *those types of* teachers you mentioned in your original comment. I appreciate it must be hard for educators at the moment, navigating the new issues that AI-driven writing tools that are available. It does sound like you're doing the best you can in a difficult and fast-moving situation. 

I haven't been in school or college myself for over five years, so I have no real interest in proving myself innocent, but in my experience students getting blamed for things on little evidence with no real recourse was a very real problem way before LLMs, and I do worry this will make it worse. Johnny Numbnut's crude use of ChatGPT may be obvious, but for every one of him there will be another student whose reasoning skills are far more advanced - and they would likely get away with using AI-generated content without raising any eyebrows. It just amplifies the existing situation where school favours the academically gifted.

It will be very interesting to see how tools like GPT will start to change educational methods and whether it will force an end to a one-size-fits-all approach to classroom education. If used well, it could be used to very easily tailor explanations to a wide range of abilities. I use it myself to break down software concepts where the only documentation that exists is far above my current knowledge level. Unfortunately, the proportion of teachers I have encountered who have genuine skill and interest in being educators is probably less than half, so I don't see this sort of thing being widely adopted anytime soon.
