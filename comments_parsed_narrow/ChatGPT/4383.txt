For spanish it's weirdly a fusion of too literal but also good translation. It say "it's all chinese to me", so it does change the language to the one spanish speakers use for the expression, but the expression usually is "it sounds like Chinese to me". To be fair, if you said what chatgpt said to a spanish speaker they would understand what you mean anyway. I give it a 9/10
