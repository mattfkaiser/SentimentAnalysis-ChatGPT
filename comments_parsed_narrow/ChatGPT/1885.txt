Oh god no. If you're somehow using ChatGPT for everything than that's great, but sometimes I'd actually like to see sources and articles and see up to date info. I still use Google over Bing chat (I use both now) because sometimes I just need results (though I should use DuckDuckGo and Bing at this point)
