ChatGPT is crap anyways. It's like a Google search, but instead of returning pages, it returns the top-5 results all mashed together into a string of words that sounds like someone could have said it.

Difference is ChatGPT is too afraid to discuss peanut butter on the off-chance someone is allergic to even thinking about it.
