I remember having to write an email to a group I'm participating in, about a super irritating situation and I was pissed. And it was so obvious in the email, including swear words. I handed that email to ChatGPT and said, "Make this sound professional and polite." And it did. I loved it: I was able to say what I wanted to say exactly how I wanted to say it, and ChatGPT just cleaned it up for me.
