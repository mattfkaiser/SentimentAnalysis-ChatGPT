Turn it in ain't really working with chatGPT, using the free version, i got a score of 3% on my project (that being mostly resources and common words) and 7% on another project on the same theme same project, while in both cases only copy pasting like 80% of it (the thing is, you can actually learn stuff from it this way... Just fact check what it says, do it 2 times and i think it might be the fastest way to learn, at least for me)
