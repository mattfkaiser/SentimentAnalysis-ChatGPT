Yeah it's stupid. Causes panic with teachers and institutions. People get worried that students aren't learning anything anymore etc. Only has a negative impact.

Do have to admit that it's been a game changer for my work. You still need to verify things, ask the right questions. You can't fully rely on ChatGPT. Someone is going to ask questions that you didn't think of and that you might not even understand. 

One of the coolest things for me is just using it on the spot during a meeting or when talking to someone. Constantly copy/pasting screenshots because I want them to see how I'm using it, I'm being fully transparent and not claiming the credits. I don't want to fake knowing something, I want them to use it too. Imagine if everyone around you at work was very capable of using it. 

One thing I'm also realizing and which blows my mind is the ability of the AI to interupt in meetings. Imagine a discussion happening and you hear a chime. Telling you that the AI wants to share something. You press the button and it just says why it agrees with you, referencing sources etc.
