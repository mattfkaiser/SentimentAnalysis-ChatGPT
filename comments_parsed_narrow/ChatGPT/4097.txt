I'm on ChatGPT plus, using GPT4 because people ask questions like this and are gobsmacked by their results. I have mild success with ChatGPT results even on 4. For my work, I've given it a small chunk of code I didn't want to debug saying what it does and what I want it to do, and ask it to debug and correct for me, just for it to give me total gibberish back that works even less than my original code. If I tell it it's wrong and it says sorry here's updated code, it usually still doesn't work and I end up debugging and correcting the code myself anyway. If I ask it to implement a fresh solution based on what I need it to do, there's usually some integration issue or another. It has absolutely not replaced me in any capacity yet. 

For applications at scale, I teach some programming in my free time to some friends and family, some basic stuff. I asked it to create a lesson plan for implementing a basic game like Connect 4 in C#. It did okay in general, but the win conditions it generated didn't work all the time, it assumed the 4th token was always the first or last placed and could never be second or third, so it never said "Win" at any point. That's fine, we implemented our own win check. 

Next I asked it to create a lesson plan for implementing Tetris. Again, good lesson plan structure, code examples were meh, collision was extremely buggy, and it goes downhill from there. 

It's strength doesn't seem to be practical to me, or replace me. If I had a non programmer colleague use GPT4 to write an application without me, I sincerely doubt it would work correctly or debug its own faults. 

I tried giving it a Sudoku puzzle that couldn't be solved in a Sudoku solver online to see if it could, it gave me back a result and I asked 8t to explain step by step it's solve process so I could be sure it didn't just brute force it. Then I noticed two 7s in the same column and it wasn't a legal solution. Telling it this, it just kept correcting itself but other numbers would change and it still wasn't a legal solution. The puzzle did have a legal solution, it was covered on Cracking The Cryptic using geometry or some new logic that hadn't been coded into the online solvers yet, and the video was a couple of years old, so I was interested in how GPT4 would do. 

In general, if my bosses announced I'm fired in place of ChatGPT, good luck to them. My buy back will be double my current salary when they realise it can't do what I do yet, and even then, it still needs a critical interface to bridge AI with reality.
