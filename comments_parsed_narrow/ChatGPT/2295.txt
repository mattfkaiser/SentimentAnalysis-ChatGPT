hmmm I find that chat gpt needs an editor. It will definitely do a lot of the things that you describe, but I think it’s most useful to treat it as a sounding board, or someone to bounce ideas off, and for you to take it away and turn the results into something that works for you. 

If I’m not satisfied with its answers, I will just tell it, explain what it’s missing, and through the back and forth dialogue, i’m able to extract what I need.
