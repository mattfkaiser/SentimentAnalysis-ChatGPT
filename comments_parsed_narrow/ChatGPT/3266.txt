No, not even close, ChatGPT is just another in a long line of similar LLMs while the Internet is not a single product of a single company, it is **THE** Internet. 

If the OP had asked "Do you believe AI is todays equivalent of the Internet in 1983?" that is a more reasonable comparison.

Or perhaps comparing ChatGPT to USENET or ARPANET could be another reasonable question. Things that were important but came and (mostly) went, as ChatGPT will too, if there are any lessons to be learnt from history.
