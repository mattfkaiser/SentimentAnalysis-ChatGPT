Just asked ChatGPT 3.5 to give me a story for Back to the Future 4. Here’s what it came up with:

“In "Back to the Future 4," we find Marty McFly and Doc Brown living in a present-day Hill Valley that has drastically changed since their previous time-traveling adventures. The town has become a bustling metropolis, with high-tech gadgets and towering skyscrapers. 

Marty, now in his 50s, is feeling disillusioned with his life and is struggling to connect with his teenage children. Meanwhile, Doc Brown has been working on a top-secret invention that he believes will revolutionize the world.

One day, Marty receives a cryptic message from his future self, warning him of a catastrophic event that will occur in the near future. With Doc's help, Marty travels back to the 1950s to try and prevent the event from happening.

While in the past, Marty and Doc come across a younger version of Biff Tannen, who has somehow obtained a time-traveling device of his own. Biff uses the device to travel to various points in time, altering history and wreaking havoc on the timeline.

Marty and Doc must chase after Biff through different eras, including the Wild West and a dystopian future. Along the way, they encounter old friends and foes, and must work together to fix the timeline and save the future.

Ultimately, Marty and Doc return to the present day, where they discover that the future they once knew has been restored. Marty reconciles with his children, and Doc unveils his revolutionary invention to the world. As the credits roll, we see a montage of scenes from the previous three movies, reminding us of the incredible journey that Marty and Doc have been on.”

It needs work, but not bad for 15 seconds worth of effort. 4.0 would probably be better and it’s clear how it fits the overarching formula.
