Given the state of the language, the understanding of the sciences and the culture of 1000 AD, the AI would most likely be a religious zealot who accepted rule by royalty, the feudal system and the beliefs of the prevailing religions as the status quo. It would most likely reject any scientific advances that went contrary to the religious beliefs of the day. For example, at that time the earth was considered the center of the universe, the sun rotated around the earth every day, and the planets also rotated around the earth. Anything else was considered heretical and wrong by the Church and that was what the ChatGPT would have been trained on and considered "Gospel". No way the AI would have gotten around that. Better if the AI started in ancient Greece or ancient Rome where education and scientific investigation were  considered culturally acceptable. That would have given the AI a much better database for training.
