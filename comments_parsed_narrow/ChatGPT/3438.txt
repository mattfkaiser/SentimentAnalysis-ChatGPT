my math teacher told me I'd never be able to use a calculator at work and I had such a hard time with math I've always thought I couldn't ever get it.

ChatGPT taught me how to do my taxes. I'm freelance and work for myself, so they're pretty complicated. I got the same result as my accountant did - that I pay a couple grand a year for!

I dunno, try asking your students about their work to see if they're cheating. There's *gotta* be a way that we can have the computer usage from Star Trek and still function as a society.
