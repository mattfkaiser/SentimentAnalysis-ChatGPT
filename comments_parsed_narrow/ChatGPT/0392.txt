I had a lot of fun with it, even though it didn't quite do what I hoped. I used a [Prompt Collaboration prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13cklzh/comment/jjgy6xt/) from elsewhere in the thread, then gave it something very similar to your initial prompt. It asked questions for a while until it had something I thought was pretty good, then I asked it to rewrite the prompt to be as concise as possible while also retaining all the information it needed meet my requirements/feedback. Ended up with this:

Create a 1-week vegetable-forward dinner meal plan for two adults and one child, avoiding eggs, pork, eggplant, and artichoke. Ensure ample servings for next-day adult lunches. Focus on whole foods with minimal processed ingredients, emphasizing chicken, legumes, tofu, and occasional beef or fish. Accommodate a 30-minute prep/cook time, and use whole grains or legume-based pasta. Include Mexican, Italian, Greek, and Mediterranean cuisines, and offer non-spicy options for the child.
