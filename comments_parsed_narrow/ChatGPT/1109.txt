The checkers are definitely flawed and I would never base an accusation or punishment on that alone. I treat them as a flag saying that I need to look more closely at the essay. I always ask my students if they can help to explain why I might be seeing that flag. 

That being said, in most cases, when asked, my students will admit to using some kind of AI software (e.g. ChatGPT to generate ideas or grammerly to edit) or there will be blatant misrepresentation of sources etc.

That’s anecdotal of course and I still don’t trust the claims being made by AI checking companies, but I haven’t yet had a true false positive.
