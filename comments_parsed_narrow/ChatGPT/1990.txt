This is sort of dangerous. Google is still very much useful and if people rely solely on ChatGPT for their info, it could possibly be the end of the internet. What happens when fact checking is no longer a thing, trust disappears out the window and nobody knows what is real or what is fake? It doesn't sound that scary, but when corporations are able to feed you any sort of BS that fit their agenda. People will slowly stop using the internet.
