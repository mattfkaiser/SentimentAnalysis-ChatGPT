OP, if you see this, my suggestion would be to do a presentation. I agree that using a new tool that helps in your field, is worth using.

But if suggest presenting it as that: "a new tool". Just like a jack hammer can be much better at digging a hole than a shovel, it doesn't mean that it doesn't come without risks.

A proper assessment should be completed, not on "whether or not this tool should be used", but "when is the right time and place to use this new tool, and what precautions do we put in place".

You can ask it anything, and it'll give you an answer. Sometimes that answer is an amazing beam of clarity - and othertimes it's completely made up.
