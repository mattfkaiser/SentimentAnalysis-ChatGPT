Reminds me of my book that I had edited by ChatGPT. (I do apologize for the plug, you truly don't have to buy it, I'm not an advertiser I promise you)... But for the sake of context, it's called, 'Neuro-Knots and the String Theory of Psychology', where we created a metaphor for suppressed memories, (usually from childhood trauma) that invokes 'lines of thought' and 'emotional attachments' that weave and intertwine and sometimes tangle up on each other, causing recurring behavior and psychological stress, like a knot in your neuro-network... Where every 'neuro-line' in our neuro-network is it's own person, place or thing; and where they intersect at a point, is where memories are made, creating the fabric of our internal life... You get the picture, (I hope)... Anyway, seems we're getting great visualizations from these new data generators... Truly amazing and fascinating stuff... And with this new take on time... I think it's time I learned to crochet.

Here's a link for anyone interested. Please don't hang me.
