Did you see the [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#recovering-alpaca-weights) model developed by Stanford? They used less than $500 (!) to compile the dataset they used to train it and it is also very impressive in performance while being way smaller. Do a simple calculation comparing the costs your company needs for using ChatGPT API and compare with the costs developing and self-hosting an alternative solution. Then add all the benefits of having a self-hosted solution (scalable, can be further tuned using company data, no privacy issues because of data going to the cloud etc.)  


With this, you go to your supervisor and suggest to take the leading role in the development of it.
