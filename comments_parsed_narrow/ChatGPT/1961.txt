ChatGPT is a way to teach yourself on how you’d like to learn. Teachers and professors have their own method which only works for a few or half at most. It’s rare to find someone that knows how to teach. Just because you have a degree and go into teaching for school/college/university, doesn’t mean you’re good at it. In terms of coding, it’s helpful because it can go many ways. Now if it’s something like history related. Which has time and date and year, then it’s flaw I believe because you cannot get rid of history. That’s my take on chatGPT.
