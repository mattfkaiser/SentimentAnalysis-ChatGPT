Legitimate question: What else can I use it for that would be helpful for my job?

I am a 40 year old who just discovered chatgpt about a month ago. I am a HS teacher, and I use it to help create ideas for topics, and I allow my students to use it to develop ideas for debates, to look up background bios for historical events and such.

My main hobby is woodworking. Feel free to include ideas for that too. Thank you!
