Common mistake!  
  
If you understand mental healthcare as being there to solve *you as a problem*, not to solve *you having a problem* then it all clicks into place.  
  
You don't need depth to paint over a crack.  
A new way of shutting you up will be found as soon as the paperwork to support it can be completed.   
  
People within the system can still be genuine, but I find real help is offered despite best practice and not because of it.  
  

It's not malicious though, it's not even indifference.  
  
Without visible symptoms to track, the clearest metric for successful treatment is fewer doctor interactions.  
So that is the primary symptom that mental health services have grown to address.  
You are experiencing - on your daughter's behalf - the discord a square peg feels as it's hammered into a round hole.  
Not because the person doing it doesn't care, but because they have been trained to care by ticking boxes instead of by building rapport.  
  
It's ***agonising***, being trivialised.  
But once you know the root cause: *a lack of connection*, you can try to build that connection with doctors yourself.  
  
I wish your daughter the best of possible health!  
With you as an advocate, forming enough rapport for her to be seen as a person instead of a health record should be a doddle. :)
