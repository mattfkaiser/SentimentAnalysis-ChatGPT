It's literally impossible the most you can maybe do is structure and semantics analysis and again based on the potential of chatGPT people can even make it write weird structured poems and sentences so I'm sure any system they can think of to detect plagiarism can be fooled with proper prompt engineering. It will only catch the super lazy people using super basic prompts. A better method is just change the curriculum around and make tests designed around people understanding things and not caring or relying so much on essays.
