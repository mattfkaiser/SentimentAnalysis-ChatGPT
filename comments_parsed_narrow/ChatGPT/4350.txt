I think those results could be improved by asking for the translation language by language.

The German translation "Für mich ist das alles Griechisch" was also the one I got from google translate and deepl. But in Germany we would rather say "Ich versteh nur Bahnhof", "Das kommt mir Spanisch vor" or "Das sind für mich Böhmische Dörfer".

Some weeks ago, I built a simple [GPT powered translation tool](https://www.gptgames.dev/tools/gptranslator.html) with the help of ChatGPT, where the user can define a specific "context" to improve translation results. This was the only translator that got the translation right. So in a certain way, GPT was able to translate it correctly.
