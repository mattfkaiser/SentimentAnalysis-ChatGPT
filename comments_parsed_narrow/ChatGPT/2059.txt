This isn't me saying that OpenAI should be liable but...

Google isn't exactly generating the content they provide. If an author gets sued for defamation, its not like the library is also responsible for that.

However, in chatGPTs case, they are not the library, they are the author. Not only that, but chatGPT won't outright tell you if its lying or wrong even if it 'knows'.
