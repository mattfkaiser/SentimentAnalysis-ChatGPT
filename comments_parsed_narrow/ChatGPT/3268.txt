I was in the tech industry when the Internet was commercialized. I was also around when mobile phones hit big, and when the iPhone came out. And now generative AI. (Which is not the same as ChatGPT, as other commenters have mentioned.) 

This feels similar to how excited we all got in 1991 (I founded the first commercial ISP in my city) when they removed commercial restrictions on the Internet, which was followed after a few years by the dot com boom/bust. I expect the same thing will happen with generative AI, where rich people will pour a bunch of money into it and serial tech bros will devour VC capital and make the climate crisis worse by requiring truly mind blowing amounts of compute. 

But like the Internet before dot com, the underlying engineering behind how companies are doing AI is an exceptional foundation to build on. I think it’ll have the same transformative power the internet does, because the guts are good AND innovation is breakneck. 

ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, etc are like… the iPhone. The technology existed before, but somebody put it together in a really nice way and basically put it in the hands of everyone. It’ll get better and cooler very fast. 

The iPhone was released in 2007. If you have a kid graduating grade 10 this year, your kid never knew a world without a smartphone. Now everybody, even your grandmother, has a smartphone because of what Apple did. That’s wild!
