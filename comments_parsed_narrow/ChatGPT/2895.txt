Since the uniqueness of communication isn't just about keywords or phrases, what I'd look for is shifts in patterns and nuances — whether in punctuation, tone, or even the varying degrees of formality in speech and writing. Any abrupt shifts from these norms can hint at an AI, like ChatGPT, at work.

Perhaps incorporating reference lists and raw notes into assignments will further challenge “cheating”. I believe it's an incredibly effective learning strategy. By explicitly linking these resources to the actual content, students can understand and assimilate information more effectively, thus refining their studying techniques and cognitive processing.

In essence, the educational payoff here is two-fold. Firstly, it encourages critical thinking by illustrating the logical connection between the resources and the material. Secondly, it leads to a deeper, more holistic understanding of the subject matter. That is a win-win.

I’m going to challenge your thinking that a 17-year-old wouldn’t pay for ChatGPT. I know several that do. They make $15 per hour at their part time jobs and have plenty of disposable income, since they live with their parent(s). Additionally, there is some “street cred” to using ChatGPT effectively. Some even want to become prompt engineers, so they are starting to work through how the tools work and seek real world experience with them.
