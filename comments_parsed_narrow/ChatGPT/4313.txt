I've found that if I tell it it's role. Like..
You are now chatAuth internationally best selling sci-fi thriller writer...
And then give it rules to follow 
Rule R1: No exposition, No foreshadowing, No moralising, etc...
I have a few other rules
Then whenever I am after a particular style of response I ask it to "remember rule R#"
If one uses a rule regularly chatgpt4 remembers it quite well but if you don't use it you will find that your rule has morphed into something it makes up for itself.
Also if you have characters, give them explicit character profiles otherwise chatGPT has a tendency to make everyone friends with each other which doesn't always make for good drama.
