Based on your questions, here's an explanation breakdown of my list:

1. **Graduating as top of my class (study assistant; broke down my curriculum, outlined my articles)**

Study assistant:Especially for ADHD assistance: I was extremely overwhelmed this semester, and I couldn’t graduate without assistance. I wanted to keep my ADHD a secret so the school didn’t provide with extra assistance.

Curriculum:Especially for ADHD assistance: My curriculum was so heavy! I felt extremely overwhelmed whenever I started studying, so I used ChatGPT to break down my curriculum, rewriting paragraphs in a more child-friendly way to help my ADHD. I asked it to “rewrite each paragraph” in a way that a child could understand.

Note taking:Then I went to Canva and copypastede the simplified curriculum and added illustrations and bright colors, which helped me with my note taking. This one was a HUGE step. It serious helped my brain fry, that you get when on ADHD! You can also ask it to generate short and memorable sentences for each curriculum paragraph, i.e. “I before E except after C”

Outlined my articles:This one I wasn’t proud of but I had to do. For one assignment where I was completely overwhelmed, I asked ChatGPT to generate a first draft of an article. Then I rewrote it with my words. I only recommend this for emergencies and NEVER send the draft without revising it. Also, note this: Pretty much any teacher will want you to use curriculum-related terms and ChatGPT will not be able to know your curriculum. So It’s very important to rewrite the AI-generated first draft based on your curriculum. Don’t skip this step!

2. **OCD (cringe attacks, extreme overthinking attacks, traumatic memories)**

Cringe attacks:Cringe attacks are destroying my mental health. So I made a list of all the bad memories I’ve had.One list for the petty moments, one list for the awkward moments, one list for the very bad moments.

Then I copy pasted it to ChatGPT and told it to break down each scenario with best versus worst case scenario.One example was when my crush saw I hd a photo of him on my phone and ChatGPT was like:

Worst case scenario: The guy thinks you’re a stalker LOLBest case scenario: The guy thinks you’re using his photo for drawing reference LOL

It’s a way to talk down your obsessive anxiety, instead of pestering your friendships lol.

3. **ADHD (helped me with my organising my thoughts, constant overthinking, rejection sensitivity)**

I also use ChatGPT to calm down my ADHD. Especially rejection sensitivity. After I sent a job application or any risky email, I start panicking. Again, instead of pestering my friends or family, I ask ChatGPT to give me worst versus best case scenarios. Sometimes this doesn’t help because let’s face it, we already have “worst case scenario mode” activated. So mostly, I ask it to calm me down.I just start with “HELP! \[Insert your overthinking, fear etc\]” It will know what to do.

Example: “HELP! I sent a really bad email! Can I share it then you tell me how bad it it is?”

Cannot stress this enough: Do NOT include personal info, like e-mails, full names and phone numbers etc.

4. **Learning the basics of chess!**

Lol. Try to ask ChatGPT to generate a chessboard in maximum size and not only can you play chess on it, but it can breakdown each move to you so you can improve your skills if you’re a beginner! For me, I knew NOTHING about chess, not even the different roles.

**5. Starting my first company (real estate)**  


Always wanted to dive into real estate but the information seemed overwhelming. So I literally asked ChatGPT "How would Edie Britt from Desperate Housewives do it?" LOL.   


It helps to use a character to give you a strategy plan. Because ChatGPT works best if you give it a reference.   


I have years of marketing experience and a great network of homeowners. I only deal with high earning buyers and sellers because I can't stomach the idea of dealing with people on low income as they're in vulnerable situations unless I'm able to offer them cheap deals which I can't.   
So it depends on your clients. I used ChatGPT mostly for communicating with my clients. I also used it to help me hire an assistant. 

My company is completely new, so I can't tell you much for now. 

6. **Answering difficult e-mails**

\[ Self explanatory \]

7. **Creating my tailored personal brand plan based on my lifestory**

Based on my non-edited biography, it helped by generating new biography, press kit, needs, wants, damage control etc.

I prompted generate a personal branding strategy plan using 48 Laws Of Power and The Art Of Seduction. Then I gave it details about me:

\- Biography (detailed)- Core values (What causes I would publicly fight for)- Potential PR damaging things about me (What could get me "cancelled")- Public figures whose public image I admire (so ChatGPT has a reference)

Please be careful feeding it names, phone numbers, personal details and other sensitive information. If need be, you can pretend that you're a brand strategist and the person whose information you're sharing is your client)

8. **Reading full resume and then generate a new CV + coverletter based on each job ad**

Copypaste your resume (again, do NOT include your real name) and then copypaste the job description.

Then ask it to identify:

1. DO I fit this role?
2. HOW do I fit this whole?
3. Improve my CV to MATCH this role (using my actual experience)
4. Generate a coverletter for this role
5. **Regain my confidence at a networking event**

Social anxiety assistant lol! For one important event where I didn’t know half of the people, I’d look at the name badges of the people around me who seemed important, I’d write down the names (new chat each time) and ChatGPT would generate a biography of the person (Only if the person is famous or well-known) For better results, use the internet plugin that comes with ChatGPT.

This is how I found out the person next to me was a hugely important executive and I saved myself so much embarassment.

I also used it during my lonely panic attacks, when I felt that I didn’t know how to strike a conversation with a specific person.

10. **Identifying the vitamins I'm missing in my multivitamin pill**

Look up the ingredient on your multivitamin pill, copy paste into ChatGPT (make sure to include units per vitamin)Then ask ChatGPT to tell you what vitamins this pill is missing. Mine identified Vitamin K. Then I wrote down all thefood I typically eat and asked ChatGPT to identify what vitamins my food covers. And so on!

Always start a new chat with each session so to not overwhelm it.

11. **Generating legal contract drafts (such as NDAs, Terms & Agreements, Privacy Policy etc)**

\[ Self explanatory \] Should only be used as a first draft.

PLEASE, if you have more questions, ask me. I know I didn't cover everything.
