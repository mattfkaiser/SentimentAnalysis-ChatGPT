You guys are using ChatGPT for some heavier work. I’m using it a lot to replace Google when it comes to Q&A. 

For example: “How much of an improvement will I get in camera quality by going from an iPhone X to 13 pro max?” And then asking it to elaborate on what it gives me. 

Vs: “You are now an expert on photography with deep experience in framing, lighting etc. I’d like you to provide a detailed response… blah blah blah.”

I think the average person gets wrapped up asking ChatGPT to do more than they need. But if you’re doing a 300-page curriculum then I can see why context matters more.
