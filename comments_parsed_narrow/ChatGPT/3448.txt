This guy, after an entire career as a teacher, has not learned what teaching really means...

What he wants it to be: "Tell people to read a book, memorize it and flawlessly repeat at least 60% of it, so he can grade it and open an imaginary door in a computer system, so the student can go on and forget 90% of it again".

What teaching is: "Get students to be interested in some form of art so much they are intrinsically motivated enough by it to teach themselves the intricacies needed to be so good at it to make a living with it, feel themselves useless because of it and help leaving the world just their tiny bit better". Whether that art is history, woodworking, programming or reading literature and experimenting with it.

ChatGPT is like google on steroids: yes, it can write an essay for you to get a grade, if you want. It can also make you learn more than you've ever been possible to learn in school.

Change your curriculum: make the right answer not easily googleable or written by ChatGPT. Yes, it IS harder to grade, but a teacher's job isn't to make work easily gradeable.
