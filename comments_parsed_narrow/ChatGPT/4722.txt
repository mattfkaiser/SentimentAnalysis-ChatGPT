Lawyer here. And while - “near-perfectly” (or, hereinafter, NP)- is generally my bread and butter when folks don’t want to amble on over to their nearest local bar association and make use of their Lawyer Referral Services (LRS) (which is a very underutilized resource) and try and do it on their own NP and then come to me…I appreciate the desire to try on your own and I’m going to suggest some prompt thoughts:

1. LOCAL RULES - READ THE LOCAL RULES they are online most times and if not head on up and talk to clerk. Using ChatGPT your NP complaint is better with it looking at rules. “In traffic court in podunk city. According to the podunk city rules, when is my discovery due to prosecutor? I am charged with disorderly blah blah drama. Will the court here me on bond on first appearance according to podunk city rules?” If it doesn’t know it will tell you. Of course, date limits..so it’s not 2023 rules…but close and better than NP.
2. NO LOCAL? That’s okay. Same above state.
3. NO STATE? That’s okay. Most legitimately governed common law states (not commonwealths or LA or some other outliers) copy and paste from Federal Procedure and most people go there anyways. Not accurate but close.

So, for example,

Ta da!
