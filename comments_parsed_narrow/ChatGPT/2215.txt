I want to push back a bit here and say that ChatGPT is really useful for YOU and probably for many of your colleagues, but for some people it just isn't that useful because it simply isn't the right tool for them. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution to every person and every job, and if they still feel ambivalent after you give your presentation you shouldn't feel ethically conflicted because "oh man they're refusing a tool that could help them save lives!" For some people it just isn't that great to use, and that's okay.
