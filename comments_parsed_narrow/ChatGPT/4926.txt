I only started yesterday and was only able to get ChatGPT to interact with it today, so it remains to be seen haha.

The error correction is crazy. Basically ChatGPT tried creating a query and received an error code like "expected an object instead of an array", it assumed it made a mistake and tried to format the data differently multiple times. I stopped it after a few times not wanting to get flagged as it couldn't really fix it - it was my mistake in an API definition.

It's certainly not perfect, but having these capabilities at such an early phase of the technology is very exciting for me.
