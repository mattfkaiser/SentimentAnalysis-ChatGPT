If I am looking for an actual answer to a question, rather than search on Google and wade through a list of sponsored links to get to a link that might have an answer that's buried in a sea of text that forces me to go through a bunch more ads, I use chatGPT.

I am going to be sad when they monetize chatGPT and it just becomes yet another way to force me through a sea of ads.
