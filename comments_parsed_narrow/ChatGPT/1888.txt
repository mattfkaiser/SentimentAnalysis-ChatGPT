If I want an explanation about something I'm interested in, usually I just read Wikipedia, with the page being located via Google search.

I feel like I can trust Wikipedia more than ChatGPT right now, and the format of learning from Wikipedia is more intuitive to me than trying to get an AI to summarize everything.
