I'm working on multiple plugins now. I wouldn't release them. ChatGPT and GPT-4 inherently become dumber the moment they need to use external info. You can only realistically use plugins to do the absolute last step of an intellectual task, without wasting most of its intelligence potential. I'm trying to see if I can combine gpt-3.5 API to do as much pre intelligence work before handing over the content to chatgpt to mitigate.
