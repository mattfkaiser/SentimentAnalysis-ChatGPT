If anything, ChatGPT might replace what I use websites like Wikipedia for - a quick, high-level overview of a concept, event, person, etc. that can give me pointers of what to look for or where to go if I want to know more.

I've been playing around with Bard tonight though, which seems really promising to me given that its information is totally current.
