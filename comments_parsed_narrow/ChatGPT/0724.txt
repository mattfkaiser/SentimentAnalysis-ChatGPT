I don’t understand how anybody can use it to do this if they don’t understand code first. Yesterday I was really struggling with some odd behaviour in a program I’d made and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why. Eventually I gave up and pasted the entire script into both bard and chatgpt (I only have access to 3.5) bard’s answer was just nonsensical but chatgpt spotted the problem right away.
