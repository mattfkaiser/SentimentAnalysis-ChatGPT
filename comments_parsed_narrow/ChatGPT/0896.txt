No. I’ve been a programmer for 25 years and I use ChatGPT now to write actual code in languages I have never learned. So, yes I know how to code, but in these languages only conceptually. ChatGPT allows me to code awesome stuff way faster than it would take me to figure it out by myself. It is simply incredible. But yes, if you‘ve never coded yourself, it’s probably not helpful.
