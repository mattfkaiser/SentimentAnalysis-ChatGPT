I am in the middle of negotiating with an insurance company for diminished value. LSS: truck was backed into, door replaced, now to collect diminished value. I asked ChatGPT what the value would be on my specific vehicle, trike level, etc. it gave me back some very valuable info. Insurance company offered me 3.5% of value. I responded with CGTP info, they have now offered me 10% and valued my vehicle by 8k more than the initial estimate. Helped me a ton!!
