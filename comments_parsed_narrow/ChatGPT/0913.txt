While I do believe that ChatGPT is powerful, I don't think you could rival anyone with a decade of experience with just ChatGPT. I'm a CS student and I can't for the life of me imagine doing anything remotely close to someone with a decade of experience even with ChatGPT, just system architecture alone would kill me, and I wouldn't want even want to trust it to an AI since I would definitely spend more time debugging that if I just did it on my own, unless it's GPT-5 with a context window of 10 million tokens or something.

Point is, ChatGPT is powerful, but not as powerful as some people might make it seem. Or maybe you just exaggerated the "decade of experience" thing and I just ranted here, lmao
