Thank you all for the advice, the condolences, and your kind offers to help me write it. Because your opinions were/are so differing, here is what I ended up doing: 

It's been a couple of rough days and with siblings and other family coming into town, the planning of the funeral, the pain, etc. I just felt I didn't have the headpace to write a "good" letter and I actually had no time left, as there were only 6 hours left to the service. 

So, I gave ChatGPT the information I wanted to be in the letter and asked it to give me a draft, which is when I wrote this post. Then, I used the structure of the letter and rewrote the whole thing, changing almost every sentence (yes, I was very much conflicted, as I wanted it to be "real"). 

However, after reading it to my siblings and them also having so much to say about it ("maybe change this or that"), I just got overwhelmed and threw it away. 

Ultimately, I ended up writing down the bullet points I initially fed into ChatGPT (woodworking, football, guitar, always being there for me, etc.) and just talked to him instead of reading. Maybe it was a little weird for my aunts or the priest, but I just looked straight at his photograph while speaking and it felt like one last intimate moment between me and him. 

I think he would be proud of me.
