That was my first impression too with the "emotion" response, but then I saw ChatGPT's image description being "A digital rendering of a humanoid robot, with an expression of surprise on its face", so I figured it could possibly (not necessarily likely, but possibly) mean the robot also needs to *show* the emotion, which would be an extension to the test. Similarly, the "dreaming" requirement could be thought of as a scientist literally checking if the robot shows physical patterns of dreaming, and not indirectly check by asking, so it would again be something beyond the original Turing Test.
