Here's a genuine experience, free from hype. 

I just got off work and went to ChatGPT to play around. I've had an idea in my head for awhile for a story, but I'm not a writer and no matter what I do I can't really get words on the page. At most a few paragraphs. Starts and stops. 

So I asked the GPT-4 version of Chat GPT to write a scene from the story. I told it the main plot and asked it to write a particular scene I've had in my head. I asked it to write it in the style that I thought I'd wanted it. It did it. Now, it's not marketable or probably even that impressive to anyone, but it's an experience I've never been able to have in my entire life. Seeing my* ideas coming to life. I could actually see the scene I was trying to come up with. If I were trying to write it myself it'd have taken me all day, but GPT gave me 3-4 pages in about 10 minutes of gentle prodding through the plot points of the scene.

It's something I've never experienced in all my years.
