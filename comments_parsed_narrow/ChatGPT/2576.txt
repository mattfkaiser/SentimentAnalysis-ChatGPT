A SCREENWRITER sits at his desk, typing away. The door swings open, and the HULK enters, wearing glasses and a bowtie, looking uncharacteristically nerdy.

HULK
Hulk have appointment with Screenwriter.

SCREENWRITER
(smiling)
Ah, yes. Mr. Hulk, welcome! Have a seat.

The Hulk squeezes into a chair, which groans under his weight.

SCREENWRITER
So, we've been brainstorming a fun catchphrase for your next film. Something that'll really stick with audiences.

HULK
Hulk ready.

The Screenwriter leans back in his chair, excited.

SCREENWRITER
Picture this: Every time you're about to transform and save the day, you yell, "It's morbin' time!"

The Hulk ponders for a moment, then grins.

HULK
(smiling)
It's morbin' time!
