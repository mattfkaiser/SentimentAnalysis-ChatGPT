We all understood what OP was asking. It’s like when we call snot tickets Kleenex. Are all tissues Kleenex brand? No. But that’s what we call them because it’s what we’re all familiar with in terms of the new question/answer system that’s put AI technology on the map. 

Not everything has to be corrected. If OP had just simply said AI, we would be asking the question: “well in what sense? How it’s used on robotics, or the mechanical/automation industry?”. 

The question was made very clear by calling it ChatGPT. And yes, it is like the birth of the internet. There are no limitations to where this is going to take us. Video games have been changed forever. Movies, commercials, even TV shows will be forever changed. Actors and actresses probably won’t even be a thing anymore. 

In a sense I would argue that the birth of ChatGPT AI is bigger than the birth of the internet.
