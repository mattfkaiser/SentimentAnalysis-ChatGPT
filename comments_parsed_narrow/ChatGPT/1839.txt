Not at all, I have just done exactly this for my grandmother. We asked all of her grandchildren to contribute memories of her, then asked chatgpt to compose a short poem based on the memories.
It was far better than anything I could write and still very personal. I ended up tweaking a few of the lines after, but chatgpt wrote 80-90% of the end result.
