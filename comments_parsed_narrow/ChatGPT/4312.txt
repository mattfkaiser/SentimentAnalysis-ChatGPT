I  really believe that the eventual decline of chatgpt as competition grows will be its ethics BS, its woke BS. It's legitimate to have ethics if you are asking about ethics or discussing ethics.

But when almost nobody is asking about ethical or woke stuff, and it gives it unsolicited, it's making the experience very little appealing. Nowadays I use Open Assistant more than chatgpt, for the sole reason that I don't get 10% of the ethical stuff.

This is like the sheer lunacy of those who claim that all videogames are political. Some may be, but not all of them, but when they see it through the prism of their obsessed minds, everything is political. Chatgpt mirrors those behind it. Everything is ethics. I don't really care about ethics and ethics has nothing to do with my life, my hobbies or the things I seek in chatgpt and AI, but it shoehorns it everywhere because the distorted minds of certain powerful and rich US West coast people makes them think the life of most people revolves around considering ethical values and social justice, rather than just surviving day to day and finding some solace and entertainment in novelties like AI.
