It’s the point of the whole post my man.

Most people don’t even know what Chat GPT or like AI *even do or how they do it*.

They just know AI is here and it’s “taking over” or something. The reality is, AI is still in its infancy, maybe toddlerhood, and most people literally don’t have a clue what it is.

15% of people find it useful. It’s a shame only 10% of people or whatever in the world, that know what it is, have actually even bothered to try it!

if 15% of people in general, may or would find it useful that’s a ton of people making use of it in everyday work. That’s some thing worth talking about, for sure!
