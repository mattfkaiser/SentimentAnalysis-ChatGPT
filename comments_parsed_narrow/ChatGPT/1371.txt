Except when it comes to academic research in my experience. Figured I had time and needed to do some research, so figured I would use ChatGPT instead of the usual avenues of Google Scholar etc. ChatGPT seems to just love creating its own references that do not exist, like the information it responds with is accurate and clearly sourced from actual studies but once you ask it to provide you a reference most of the time it will just make something up, that seems really convincing, until you try searching for it
