It's so cute when these writers (all the people chatgpt is basing this reply on) think that humanity and civilization will be limited to "Earth" once we have ASI.

As if people won't be immortal hedonist gods venturing out into space, building worlds and structures in space.

As if the "health" of the planet is even relevant, when you could just take a step into the next galaxy over by going to sleep, or experiencing countless millions of lifetimes in your journey, or by changing your awareness to make it feel like the journey takes a few seconds.

As if humans will continue to look like hairless monkeys - we wont be supernatural hivemind constructs and AI and robots and planets and bugs and trees and animals.

As if all people want to do is live like a rich person from the 1950's.
