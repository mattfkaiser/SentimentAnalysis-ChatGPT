Haha it can certainly help college students with all the long-form videos. You can try Jumpcut on the web: www.jumpcut.app, and as a Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jumpcut/jicbaeklgoninplhmenhndnidnbfaohm

It works on YouTube videos only at the moment, you can create any shortened version that you want (highlights/15 minute version/Only the parts that discuss X) and share it with anyone you want and they will only watch the parts you edited in and skip everything else. With the plugin ChatGPT will do the editing!
