I am a student and this is irrelevant for me, as AI detectors provide no reliable, let alone legal, basis for a professor to classify my essay as AI-written. Even if the AI detectors show that my essay is 100% AI-witten as for the reasons mentioned above. What however concerns me is to directly ask Chat GPT if it wrote a text, this is always accurate and this far I have not been able to circumvent this. So when I let Chat GPT write a text, and later copy that text again and ask Chap GPT if it wrote it, it will answer reliably, even if the text has been rewritten by myself or websites liken Quillbot.
