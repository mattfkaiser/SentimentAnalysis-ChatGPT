1. I use it to check my own biases with op eds and speeches and other political stuff. If something makes me feel strongly, I copy it into chat gpt and ask it to tell me the logical fallacies and possible misinformation in the piece. It is a HUGE gut check!!

2. As a working parent, I use it to outsource domestic labour, specifically:

- voice to text explained our usual routine and asked it to turn them into concise instructions for the dogsitter rather than typing it all out myself

- type in the ingredients on sale at the local grocery store this week and generate a meal plan (or at least some good ideas!)

- generate custom fun bedtime stories for my kids (with themes/morals that align with things they are currently dealing with)

- get a starting point for lists of things to pack and prep for trips
