We will see what happens after the smoke settle, I think it is more ignorant to fall on the over hype trap. In history for every hype that was actually revolutionary there's hundreds that where wrong.

And more ignorant is to think that any of us can predict what will happen in the future.

The best you can do is be up to date with the technology and be prepared for whatever it happens.

For me as a developer, I keep trying to use chatgpt to help me, and it have been pretty useless. A lot of the time it give me code that doesn't even compile. As a developer I see it as a glorified Google.
