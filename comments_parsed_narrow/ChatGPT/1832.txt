I will share my experience, last week I had to give a eulogy for my grandfather and had to do it in my native language (immigrant that came to US as a kid). I am not a great writer and doubly so in my native language.

I didn't ask ChatGPT to write it for me, but I asked it to act as a writing partner and start by asking me leading questions to help flush out what I wanted to say. It generated a list of 10 or so questions like: my favorite memory, activities we liked to do together, etc. Then after I answered all these questions it helped string together a structure of the eulogy.

I went back and forth on the tone and phrasing for a while until I was happy with the result in English. I then asked it to translate the text for me, not verbatim but to do it's best to maintain meaning and tone. It did a pretty good job but after a few more back and forth exchanges and some additional manual editing I was happy with the final text which I read last Friday.

I don't think in the end it sounded exactly like my voice, but did a better job communicating what I wanted to say that I could have.
