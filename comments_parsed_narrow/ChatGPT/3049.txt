I believe that the money will flow to other industries.
Not every industry needs a software engineer making an API to do this or that. 
Get me higher level usecases from other industries that will be automated, and then I will agree.

Also ChatGPT is a little far away from penetrating into law.
It is VERY VERY good at recognising cases and giving decisions, but terrible at holding arguments. Considering it can be gaslighted easily. Don't give me the 2+2=4/5 example of anti gaslighting (since that's a hard truth, how many will you provide)

Also Systems Engineering/Robotics will be an active area of development since hardware is not as straightforward as....well...software.

Do provide me examples in other industries.
