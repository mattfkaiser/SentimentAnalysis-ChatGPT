The other question would be right now though: Why do you need that?

Also, in the hearing they talked about political issues in the next year when it comes to voting. So it's best to lock all political things down for now.

If companies out there are making 5-6 digits a month with ChatGPT without politics right now and for the past months, I think locking it down won't hurt anyone, but actually help everyone in the long run while we figure this out.
