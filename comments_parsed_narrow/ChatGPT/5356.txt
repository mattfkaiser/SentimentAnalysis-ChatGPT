It amazes me that people teaching actual science cannot test and evaluate this simple premise. Are chatGPT and or many of the other AI validation methods out there reliable at all?

I wonder what the accuracy rate would be if any of the teachers cared to measure it themselves themselves, against their own old texts .

They're teaching science and the scientific method FCS
