You say you work in pediatrics so I guess you work saving lives, please don't put others lives in the hands of Chat GPT, chat GPT is nice and a technical marvel but it is still inaccurate and imperfect, in any case Chat GPT can handle administrative stuff but it definitely cannot (and should not) be used to provide medical treatment/diagnosis or anything that puts someone's life in danger, Chat GPT is not qualified to make decisions of utmost importance let alone substitute the opinion of a qualified and experienced physician.
