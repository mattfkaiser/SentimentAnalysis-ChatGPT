i beg to differ. chatgpt is not useless despite the rules getting more strict. ive been using chatgpt almost everyday for translation purposes in a big scale and it really helps me reduce my workload and time. im not defending openAi for further strict rules but saying everything is useless just because a feature got restricted is plain ignorance at this point
