I am a journalist as well. How do you expect the industry to grow if you stop hiring interns? 

Also, with the wild inaccuracies and hallucinations of ChatGPT, I sincerely hope no serious news outlet is thinking about replacing human jobs with it. 

I can maybe see ChatGPT becoming for journalist what Photoshop is for photographers, but I don't think it (or any generative AI programme) will actually replace human journalism.
