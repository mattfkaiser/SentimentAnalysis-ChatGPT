This isn't about coding, and as a ChatGPT user since January, I don't have extensive experience. However, I've noticed significant inconsistency with GPT 3.5 and 4 recently. One moment, ChatGPT follows a prompt perfectly, but in the next conversation, it disregards virtually every aspect of the prompt and creates its own rules. I ask ChatGPT to review the prompt and provide examples of previous successful outputs, which leads to some improvements. However, every improvement in one aspect seems to trigger errors in others. Then, the next hour, ChatGPT resumes following the same prompt perfectly again.
