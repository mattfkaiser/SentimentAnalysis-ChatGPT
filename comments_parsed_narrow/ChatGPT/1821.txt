I think this is more a how will you deal with something this important being written by an ai language model. What is important to you? That it's handwritten by you? That it's a subjectively good speech?

Also writing this might be a positive part of the grieving process - something you might be trying to avoid by having ai write it.

I'm the end whether it's by you or chatgpt, if it brings closure and a tear to the eye - and you are ok with whoever wrote it - all is good.
