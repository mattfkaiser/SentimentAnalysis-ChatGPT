As an adult, I do a lot of self study in topics I find interesting. ChatGPT has been great for those situations where you just don’t get what the book or resource is saying, and there’s no teacher/professor to ask. Already helped me understand some pretty complex topics (as long as you are willing to do a little more research to back up some of the claims it makes).
