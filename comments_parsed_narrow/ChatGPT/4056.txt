You say that it won't replace programmers but I disagree to a point. I've asked GPT to write code that would have probably taken a month and it did it in a few seconds for $0 when the same amount of work it did might have costed $200 from a hired worker on Upwork. I had chat gpt write scripts that I've wanted for years but have never had the money to commission someone to do it. Chat GPT has automated 90% of my job.
