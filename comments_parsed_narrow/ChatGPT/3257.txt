Pretty sure it's the opposite. ChatGPT was trained on the internet and is therefor just the internet condensed. It's so revolutionary because we are conditioned to an internet with pop ups and attention grabbers that when something gives us exactly what we asked for with no fluff; it's mind blowing. It's actually quite reminiscent of original chat rooms. The difference being there was a person answering your questions and you had to be in the correct room. Kind of like Reddit today. That is to say ChatGPT is the final form of the internet. 

The next, "birth-of-the-internet" will come in the form of an AI that is self replicating and does not have the capability to be throttled back. No, not Skynet. For example, ChatGPT lacks the ability to self-delete. It may be morbid to think in those terms but "I think therefor I am" really applies here. If a machine has the ability to equivalently commit suicide then it is truly sentient. Also, that implies total autonomy for creation. When we have a machine that can not only create but decide what to create, then we will have the next, "birth-of-the-internet."
