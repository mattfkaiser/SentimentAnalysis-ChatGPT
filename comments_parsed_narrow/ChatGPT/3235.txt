AI will change the world. To finding and curing disease to helping lower the cost (or need) to use attorneys.  It's endless on what it can do. 
AI is easily the most disruptive technology since the internet - it will change the way we all live our lives. 
I'm amazed how much I use chatgpt now. It's hard to fathom what that will look like in 20 or 30 years. The internet was much slower to be adopted and was not really "mainstream" until the 1990s.  And user adoption for AI is FASTER than the internet. Here's the article from the time

Only two months after its launch in late November, the chatbot had 100 million monthly active users in January, according to data from Similarweb. A study from Swiss bank UBS noted that “in 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app.” OpenAI, which owns and hosts ChatGPT, recently became one of the 50 most visited websites in the world, according to Digital-adoption.com.
