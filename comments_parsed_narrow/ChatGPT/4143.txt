You might be thinking too hard on this.

My guess is there's a layer in between you and chatgpt that sanitizes prompts people are giving it and does things like remove <| |> blocks. It could be at the UI layer or API that's routing prompts to chatgpt servers and giving you back the answers.

Beyond this outer layer is chatgpt, which probably doesn't do anything too special with <| |> blocks.

So it's not that chatgpt itself is blind to stuff like that or it's some wormhole in chatgpt's inner workings. It's simply filtered out by chatgpt's glasses.
