I hope you get better soon. Thanks a ton for sharing this!

I have had headaches the last 20 years anytime I exert myself physically. Multiple Dr's and specialist nobody could figure out why. Turns out I was drying out my nasal caveties and just needed to breath through my nose more and use saline.

20 fucking years and chat gpt figured it out in 10 seconds.
