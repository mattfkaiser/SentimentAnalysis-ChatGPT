It's interesting, I kind of use it like I do tarot cards. They're a tool for reflection and self examination, more than a divine oracle into the universe for me. I like using chatGPT sus out what I'm thinking better. It helps me raise ideas for character development, conflict, and gives me some insight about how two opposing things can come together for dramatic tension. I'm still the one ultimately doing the writing, prompting, and actively building the world, but the AI seems to help me refine my ideas into something more concrete faster than I'd be able to do alone. And, since it's for fiction, it's a low-stakes usage-- there's no facts to check or information to get correct.
