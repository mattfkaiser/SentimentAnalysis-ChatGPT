Talk to it like a person about what you want to do and what you need it to do. The code it returns is in my experience always readable.  
Here's what I'm currently building with it: [https://github.com/mwillerich/browsersnake](https://github.com/mwillerich/browsersnake)

Most of the code comes from

* discussing what I want to do next, agreeing on an approach
* asking for ChatGPT to give me the code
* correcting the code so it fits into the rest of the project, because it keeps forgetting what it gave me before all.the.time.
