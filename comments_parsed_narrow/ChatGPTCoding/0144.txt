It's fairly unexciting really.. ChatGPT extracts values for the relevant api endpoint, performs the query, and the api returns a json object (generally speaking).

ChatGPT then evaluates the object and responds using natural language.

I've found it's best to create new endpoints for exactly the reason you say - the smaller, more concise your response can be, the better the results.

Tip: click the down arrow next to the inline plugin details and you can see all of this.
