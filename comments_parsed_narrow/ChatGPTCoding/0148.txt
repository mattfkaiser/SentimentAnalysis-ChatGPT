I've recreated how ChatGPT plugins work using my own code. In essence, I've created external chatbots that can work with any plugins that have been created for ChatGPT.

I use a series of ChatGPT api calls, along with some custom code, to extract the parameters, prepare the API call, handle the response and then respond to the user.

This is just traditional programming, although "agents" are the buzzword these days for essentially doing the same thing.
