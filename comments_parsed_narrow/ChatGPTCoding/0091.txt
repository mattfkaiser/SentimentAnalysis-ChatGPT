GPT-4 using the api specifically - not chatgpt using gpt-4 - there's a distinction. it only works in the playground. but yep - it works great for adding reference documents or data - i had it reference it's own api to help me write a python code that i was using the old syntax (using gpt-3), it was able to use data from the site outside of it's training to give me the correct version of the code.
