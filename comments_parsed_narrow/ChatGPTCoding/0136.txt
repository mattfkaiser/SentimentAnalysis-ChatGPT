People have been complaining in this exact way ever since around a week or two after ChatGPT was released in November. Every week, I see people say, “last week ChatGPT was smarter! Why have they lobotomized it?”

I’m pretty sure it’s because of the user’s misperceptions. We tend to overestimate the AI at first, and then its shortcomings become increasingly obvious.
