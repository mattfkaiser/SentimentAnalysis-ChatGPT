Depends on a lot of factors, but the more complex the app, the difficulty increase will be exponential.

Use chatgpt to learn how to code, while you build your app with it's support, feasible, again complexity dictates. 

Start building a simple app leveraging chatgpt to support you.

In my experience chatgot can spit out simple functions, but tying them all together in an app will still require a lot of knowledge from the user. Maybe in the future it might be more feasible, but not quite today.
