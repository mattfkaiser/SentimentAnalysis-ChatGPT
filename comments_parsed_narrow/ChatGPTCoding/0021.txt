This isn’t quite right. 

ChatGPT’s output is not copyrightable based on current US law. Full stop. (Seriously: Google this)

That doesn’t mean you are free to use ChatGPT’s outputs freely: ChatGPT clearly will often regurgitate copyrighted content (ask it for song lyrics, for instance). 

Further, software source code copyright is a tricky subject. 

OP is right to be concerned about the business risk of using copilot.
