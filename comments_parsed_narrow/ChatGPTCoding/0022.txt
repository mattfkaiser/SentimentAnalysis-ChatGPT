ChatGPT's code interpreter does spit out pre-formed code snippets. I've even recognized some of them from tutorial sites like GeeksForGeeks. Generally there is an optimal solution to a given coding problem. If chatGPT gave a different answer every time you asked it to code a specific algorithm, it would be kinda useless. Most of the code comes from open source projects posted on github.

If OpenAI wanted to respect the GPL, they would maintain an attribution database where they could tell you the conditions for the license of code snippets.
