ChatGPT can blurt out some good code but it won't without the proper users input, last month I really wanted to know how to scrape websites with python, I thought ChatGPT will do everything for me, after a week of trying and numerous failed attempts I understood that a lot has changed with Selenium, that's why I went and watched like 10 videos on webscraping, a few videos on xpath. Afterwards I knew how to find any single element by just using xpath, I then tried to scrape a single website page, after I accomplished that myself without ChatGPT. I understood what I had to input for the ChatGPT AI to understand what I want, and just then it started spitting out the code I want that does what I want and even then I had to try over and over again. So it's only a helping tool, it won't give you all the code for the webscraper to run and work properly. So as I said in my first comment, first learn with Youtube, try a few small projects and only then go to ChatGPT for help. I would advise you to use PyCharm its an easy IDE to install all the needed packages for your script.
