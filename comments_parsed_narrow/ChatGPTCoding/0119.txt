I was using ChatGpt all the while for programming related. I’m exploring the Playground after seeing your comment. 

I didn’t grasp fully how to take advantage of this compared to gpt. I enter the main prompt under the system prompt. It gave the entire source code file spanning say 100 lines. Now what should I do to tweak it? 

If I use the “Add message” option and enter a message informing the tweak needed, it will generate the entire code again? Or I should enter that tweak as part of the system prompt? 

I also noticed that each of its output is editable and can be deleted. What is the significance of them? 

Sorry for many questions. Playground is something I’m seeing first time and trying to use it for programming related.
