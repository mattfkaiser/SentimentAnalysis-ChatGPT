You are in the wrong place. Go to the openai playground and configure it for chat mode, max tokens.

No limit for gpt4.
No censor (or at least munch much less).
Custom system prompt.

Don’t think of coding as a long back and forth conversation. Think of it as a loop of refining and updating the systemprompt with the latest information and clearing out the conversation every few entries and starting over. You will get much more mileage out of things, more lines of code it can keep track of, and you can work endlessly. 

In the system prompt I will put something like “you are a coding assistant working on XYZ app. It has these features. It uses these APIs. He is the relevant API documentation. The credentials are in a file called XYZ formatted this or that way. Our draft code looks like this…”

Then the chat is just “fix this bug.” I fix it an incorporate it into the system prompt and start over.

You are creating a custom chat gpt that understands before you start chatting with it everything it needs to know about your project so you can just get right to it.
