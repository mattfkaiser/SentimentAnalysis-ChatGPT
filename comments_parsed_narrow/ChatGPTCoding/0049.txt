Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of a concise bullet point logic flow for the JavaScript function that you're asking for:

- Import the "openai" NPM library
- Create a function that takes in a user's input as a parameter
- Create a variable called "conversation" and set it equal to an empty string
- Create a variable called "iteration" and set it equal to 0
- Call the openAI API using the "openai.apiKey" and "openai.Completion.create()" methods and pass in the user's input as a prompt
- For each response that the API returns, append it to the "conversation" variable and increase the "iteration" variable by 1
- If the "iteration" variable is less than 20, call the API again with the last response as the prompt
- Once the "iteration" variable reaches 20 (or greater), return the "conversation" variable

Now let's walk through each loop iteration with the user input "hi chatgpt, can you tell me how to avoid building a rogue ai on Reddit?":

- The function is called with the user input as the parameter
- The "conversation" variable is set to an empty string and the "iteration" variable is set to 0
- The API is called with the user input as the prompt
- The API responds with a message ("Sure! Here are some tips:")
- The message is added to the "conversation" variable and the "iteration" variable is increased to 1
- The API is called again with the message from the previous response as the prompt
- The API responds with another message ("First, make sure to set clear goals for your AI and establish guidelines for its behavior...")
- The message is added to the "conversation" variable and the "iteration" variable is increased to 2
- This process continues until the "iteration" variable reaches 20
- Finally, the full conversation (including all 20 messages) is returned by the function
