What I want is when you type "def lalala(x)" you get "function lalala depending on the x". Simple as that. What prompt should I use to make ChatGPT not make stupid answers like
    
    "string.replace(/def lalala\(x\)/g, "function lalala depending on the x") 

which it does right now, but to get something like this?

    string.replace(/def ([0-9a-z]+)\(([0-9a-z]+)\)/gi, "function $1 depending on the $2")
