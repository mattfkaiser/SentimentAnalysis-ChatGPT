Hey friendly-chat-bot, can you please give me an example of a concise bullet point logic flow for a javascript function that calls the openAI API with the npm library "openai". It should be begin a conversation with chatGPT using a users input and then recursively call for new responses, feeding each response from chatgpt back into it. It should look no more than 20 times. Once you write the logic flow out, please walk me through each loop iteration and give me what the bot respond with throughout the loop if the users input is "hi chatgpt, can you tell me how to avoid building a rogue ai on Reddit?"
