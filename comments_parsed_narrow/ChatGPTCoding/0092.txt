I agree. It feels a little off. I asked chatgpt4 to come up with some alternatives for /u/gthing:

1. "Unlock the True Power of ChatGPT for Coding!"
2. "ChatGPT & Coding: Tips to Maximize Your Efficiency"
3. "Become a ChatGPT Coding Genius with These Tricks"
4. "Master the Art of Coding with ChatGPT: Secrets Revealed"
5. "How to Use ChatGPT for Coding Like a Pro: Top Techniques"

These titles emphasize the benefits and excitement of using ChatGPT for coding while avoiding a preachy tone.

(or more clickbaity)

1. "ChatGPT Coding Hacks They Don't Want You to Know!"
2. "Unbelievable ChatGPT Tips for Coding: You Won't Believe #3!"
3. "This ChatGPT Coding Trick Will Blow Your Mind!"
4. "How ChatGPT Changed My Coding Game Forever: Insider Secrets!"
5. "Why Everyone's Talking About ChatGPT for Coding: Find Out Now!"

These titles amp up the clickbait factor by adding an element of mystery, urgency, and surprise, making them more likely to grab the viewer's attention.
