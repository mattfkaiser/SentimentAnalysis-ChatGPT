It’s actually not very hard.

Here are steps:

1) Sign up for the GPT-3.5 API from OpenAI

2) Use GPT-3.5 API tokens to send and receive JSON data to GPT API.

3) Input/output JSON data as desired.



That’s all it takes to build an ‘app’ using ChatGPT.

If you want it to do anything extra, then yes a non-technical person will find it difficult.
