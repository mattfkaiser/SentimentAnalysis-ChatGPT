AFAICT chatgpt is making the decision on whether or not to use a particular plugin, and if it does decide to use a plugin knows how to return data that can easily be used with that plugin (i.e. return the exact parameters and endpoint that needs to be called).

I don't think plugin developers are responsible for parsing chatgpt's output and deciding whether it should result in a call to the external plugin API.
