Thank you, David! I would like to ask you one more advise. At the moment I'm building a credit score solution, in which companies can send their financial sheets and revenue data, and my plataform will analyze the info and return some credit risk score based on that company. I am trying to use langchain and openai for this, but Im having a lot of trouble in reading the data (chat gpt cannot read correctly some cells on the sheets) and performing some calculations to get the company financial index. The issue here is that the sheets don't follow a strict pattern, so I am trying to use machine learning to extract useful data from it. Do you have any articles/ links that could help me with this task?
