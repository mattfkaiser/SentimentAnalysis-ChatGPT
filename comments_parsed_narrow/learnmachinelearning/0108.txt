On thing worth pointing out to the people who say “ChatGPT failed my test case” is that this isn’t about just ChatGPT. Everyone here understands that machine learning and computing in general has been growing exponentially. 

ChatGPT-2, 3, 4 will all come out in a few years and all be substantial improvements. If the rate of progress is half of what it has been so far in machine learning, ChatGPT-2, 3, 4 are all contenders for general purpose programmers. A decently good general purpose programming AI that needs little to no direct supervision can work in development cycles of days, hours, or minutes. That development time is fast enough to create multiple entire applications and ask the customer which of the 100 versions it likes best. To reach a recursive “intelligence explosion” we only need a model better at programing the comparatively narrow domain of machine learning models than current scientists. 

I strongly feel that this is an inflection point. Previous models where not smart enough for this. ChatGPT/GPT-3.5 is smart enough for this type of thing to be probably not possible, but plausible in a realistic way. No ChatGPT will not take our jobs, but now there is a non-trivial chance that each new generation might take all of our jobs at once.
