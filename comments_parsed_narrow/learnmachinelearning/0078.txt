I think you are vastly underestimating how much "simple" groundword there is in education. 

I am betting money that this will be implemented for high school students everywhere. The amount of work this thing can take from a teachers shoulders will be absolutely insane.

Think about your school days and how much of the teachers attention was needed for simple questions which chatgpt can easily answer that only a small fraction of the class are actually asking.

Literally pick any high school topic you now something about and see if chatgpt could teach you the concepts.

The barrier to asking stupid questions, which you wouldnt ask a teacher in school for a bunch of reasons is literally 0, and the answers you get for those topics are easily a net benefit.

Will this replace a private teacher that is an expert on a topic and only has a single student, no not now.
