Your brain processes data slower but is *always* learning. ChatGPT runs on computers that do billions of calculations a second, but it completely fails on new experiences. If you ask ChatGPT about recent events, it’ll be dumbfounded as the training happened months ago. Ask it about Kevin McCarthy and his quest to get Speaker of the House of the United States and you won’t get anything of use. 

Put another way, ChatGPT is truly genius level auto-complete from 6 months ago.
