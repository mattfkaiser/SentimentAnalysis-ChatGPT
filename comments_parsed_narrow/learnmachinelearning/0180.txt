Agreed. So basically fake reviews, generated articles are going to fill the internet now unless people know how to do prompts and techniques inside of ChatGPT and make unique content out of it. I bet there will be a ChatGPT content detector and rankings will depend on how the content looks user generated or bot generated. Time will tell I guess.
