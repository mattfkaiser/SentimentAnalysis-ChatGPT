While it is certainly true that having some tests is better than having no tests at all, it is important to maintain a realistic perspective regarding what will become the norm. Once an activity reaches an automated level comparable to that of humans, humans don't think "Let me use this as a stepping stone to improve it myself". Instead, that particular activity becomes solely handled by machines, and within a few months, it becomes inconceivable for a human to perform those tasks, as "we humans have better things to do." This mindset is beneficial for many repetitive and mindless tasks, but it so happens that writing tests effectively requires a significant amount of creativity and introspection. Therefore, relying on LLMs to write tests for us is not a great idea.

Obviously, it is impossible to assess the extent to which you now "know a ton more about virtualization and PCI devices than I did a week ago." I would say you have become familiar with the way that setup is configured, but since you were extensively guided by ChatGPT, it is unlikely that you will remember many details after a few weeks. Essentially, you haven't become more proficient at solving such problems, as expertise only comes with a lot of practice, facing unexpected issues, and persisting with unsuccessful approaches until a moment of clarity arrives and you finally figure out a solution.

> ...it literally does though? how does asking someone "hey this part confused me, can you explain it to me?" and iterating on that explanation not enhance your understanding or ability to comprehend complex topics?

It doesn't enhance your understanding because you are given the answer to your question right away without being forced to think deeply about that confusing part first.

> What exactly does "independently grappling" mean? Seriously, think about this for a moment, and then reflect on what your process is when you are independently grappling with a complex subject. Does it involve google? Do you visit stackexchange and learn from discussions other people who have encountered those issues had previously? do you go to forums or discord and engage in discussions directly? do you hit the literature and research the topic? if you're a student, do you visit office hours or consult with your peers?

No, independently grappling doesn't mean searching for the solution on Google, finding a StackExchange answer, or asking others if they already know the solution. "Independently" means relying on your own abilities and thinking process. It doesn't mean you can't use Google to clarify concepts or consult the available literature, especially when dealing with advanced topics or unanswered questions. Nonetheless, in the same way as with ChatGPT, I would advice against pursuing these avenues until you have genuinely made a effort to solve the problem on your own. Now, you bring up a really good point: if others have already solved the same problem, why go through the trouble of doing it yourself? The reason is that by challenging yourself to frequently figure things out independently, even when existing solutions are available, you develop the confidence and essential skills needed for when you encounter unfamiliar challenges. As you know, progress doesn't arise from everyone sharing solutions that are already known, but rather from solving what no one else knows how to solve.
