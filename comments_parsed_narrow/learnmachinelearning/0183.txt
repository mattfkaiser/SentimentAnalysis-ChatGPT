Not sure if this is exactly what your talking about, but recently built this site https://playful-systems.com.au and pretty much all of the copy on the sites 10 pages are all written by ChatGPT, with very light editing by me. Overall I’m very happy with it, it’s much better than what I could write. But I do intend on hiring someone to rewrite it in the future.
