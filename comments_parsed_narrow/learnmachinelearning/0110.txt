People are worried too much, chatGPT doesn't code well in sorting algorithms, and other data structure challenges, failing most test cases. I tried some Hackercode examples, and it fails to give code that works (as in giving the correct output) just about every time. 

I also don't think it's a bad thing to have an answer to look at, people just want to learn why their code is not working.
