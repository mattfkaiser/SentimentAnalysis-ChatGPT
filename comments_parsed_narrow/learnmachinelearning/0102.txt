Or, make the tests oral so the professor knows you have actually mastered the material. That’s what I might do. 

I don’t have a problem using that kind of tech to create a palette for a story. Or write some marketing material. We’ve been developing this stuff since the 90s. It’s a productivity tool. I agree with you there.  

But if a course is there to help you learn how to write discourse or make arguments or do research, and you skip it, you’re wasting a lot of money - why even take the course? You’re not developing your own skills or point of view or distinct style of writing and I would think that you’d want to develop those skills before picking up a tool that might wash it away. You’re not learning to ingest a lot of information quickly. The tool isn’t going to make you good at making oral arguments, that’s a practiced art that is enhanced by learning to write good arguments. It’s not going to help you learn how to perform research. So why are you there? Drop the class so someone who actually likes to read and write can take it. 

Now if the class is using chatGPT to write a story with a point of view, okay then. Everyone knows where they stand.
