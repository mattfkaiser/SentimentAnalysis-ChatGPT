It’s mostly destroyed my interest in ML. I’m impressed obviously by the capability, but I can’t bare to listen to another talk about the value of it, read about “prompt engineering”, or whatever else. This will pass sure, but I don’t love how it’s continuing a trend of centralization, and a “one size fits all” approach to ML. For the latter, this was the fun part of my job- finding the best solution to the problem. It’s going to be “prove to the boss that chat gpt isn’t the answer to everything” for now.
