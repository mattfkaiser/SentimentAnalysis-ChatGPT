I can say this, the best use of Chat GPT is to get direction on topics you don’t know about, to get validation and insight into those that you do, and to assist in writing code. 

It’s still not great at understanding what is asked of it and it flat fails nuanced logic. It’s a fantastic tool, but it’s basically like an average minded know it all with impeccable reading comprehension.
