even if the tests aren't a perfect full coverage suite that captures every imaginable edge case or state the code can reach, something is better than nothing. lots of people who would otherwise never write tests *at all* are adding test suites now, and it's a lot easier to grow a test suite that's already in place when you encounter those edge cases. treat it the same way you would output from a junior dev: it's probably not perfect, but it's a good start and probably just needs a little polish and iteration. Also, considering where the state of the technology is right now, imagine where we'll be in a year.

> The fact that you can proficiently use new tools with little prior knowledge doesn't expand your skillset

I'm not a sysadmin and had never heard of kvm, qemu, vfio, virt-manager or gpu pass through a few days ago. With chatgpt's help I was able to set up virtualization with GPU pass through on my workstation. It wasn't a one-and-done thing and chatgpt didn't do it for me. having gone through that process (and chatgpt being extremely helpful but not getting everything perfectly correct), I now know *a ton* more about virtualization and pci devices than I did a week ago. suffice it to say: I beg to differ.

> reading a research article and asking an LLM about confusing parts doesn't enhance your understanding or ability to comprehend complex topics. 

...it literally does though? how does asking someone ""hey this part confused me, can you explain it to me?"" and iterating on that explanation not enhance your understanding or ability to comprehend complex topics?

> independently grappling with complex subjects.

What exactly does ""independently grappling"" mean? Seriously, think about this for a moment, and then reflect on what your process is when you are independently grappling with a complex subject. Does it involve google? Do you visit stackexchange and learn from discussions other people who have encountered those issues had previously? do you go to forums or discord and engage in discussions directly? do you hit the literature and research the topic? if you're a student, do you visit office hours or consult with your peers? Would you fault anyone or express the same concern to anyone who described to you that they were getting problem solving assistance from google, domain experts, study groups, or office hours? 

If the challenges you are facing are challenges others have faced and solved already, you can leverage the work that came before you to accelerate your path to a solution. LLMs make getting on that path as easy as if you had a personal tutor in the room holding your hand. Do you have these same concerns that tutelage is a crutch that holds people back from growing rather than supporting their growth?

> people will become so reliant on the simplified output of LLMs that they will be incapable of independently grappling with complex subjects.

are you ""reliant"" on your junior devs and less experienced colleagues? are they able to accelerate your workflow despite perhaps not being able to meet the quality of output that you personally produce? does having a team comprised of less experienced people to supervise weaken your ability to achieve your goals or is it a force amplifier? i think maybe you're discounting the value of an extra set of hands (even clumsy hands) much more than you realize.",learnmachinelearning,"{'fear': 0.04040404040404041, 'anger': 0.04040404040404041, 'anticip': 0.0, 'trust': 0.18181818181818182, 'surprise': 0.020202020202020204, 'positive': 0.36363636363636365, 'negative': 0.1111111111111111, 'sadness': 0.06060606060606061, 'disgust': 0.030303030303030304, 'joy': 0.0707070707070707, 'anticipation': 0.08080808080808081}",Positive,positive
jjrvfor,2,r_31415,2023-05-11 14:44:38,"While it is certainly true that having some tests is better than having no tests at all, it is important to maintain a realistic perspective regarding what will become the norm. Once an activity reaches an automated level comparable to that of humans, humans don't think ""Let me use this as a stepping stone to improve it myself"". Instead, that particular activity becomes solely handled by machines, and within a few months, it becomes inconceivable for a human to perform those tasks, as ""we humans have better things to do."" This mindset is beneficial for many repetitive and mindless tasks, but it so happens that writing tests effectively requires a significant amount of creativity and introspection. Therefore, relying on LLMs to write tests for us is not a great idea.

Obviously, it is impossible to assess the extent to which you now ""know a ton more about virtualization and PCI devices than I did a week ago."" I would say you have become familiar with the way that setup is configured, but since you were extensively guided by ChatGPT, it is unlikely that you will remember many details after a few weeks. Essentially, you haven't become more proficient at solving such problems, as expertise only comes with a lot of practice, facing unexpected issues, and persisting with unsuccessful approaches until a moment of clarity arrives and you finally figure out a solution.

> ...it literally does though? how does asking someone ""hey this part confused me, can you explain it to me?"" and iterating on that explanation not enhance your understanding or ability to comprehend complex topics?

It doesn't enhance your understanding because you are given the answer to your question right away without being forced to think deeply about that confusing part first.

No, independently grappling doesn't mean searching for the solution on Google, finding a StackExchange answer, or asking others if they already know the solution. ""Independently"" means relying on your own abilities and thinking process. It doesn't mean you can't use Google to clarify concepts or consult the available literature, especially when dealing with advanced topics or unanswered questions. Nonetheless, in the same way as with ChatGPT, I would advice against pursuing these avenues until you have genuinely made a effort to solve the problem on your own. Now, you bring up a really good point: if others have already solved the same problem, why go through the trouble of doing it yourself? The reason is that by challenging yourself to frequently figure things out independently, even when existing solutions are available, you develop the confidence and essential skills needed for when you encounter unfamiliar challenges. As you know, progress doesn't arise from everyone sharing solutions that are already known, but rather from solving what no one else knows how to solve.",learnmachinelearning,"{'fear': 0.05555555555555555, 'anger': 0.03333333333333333, 'anticip': 0.0, 'trust': 0.17777777777777778, 'surprise': 0.03333333333333333, 'positive': 0.37777777777777777, 'negative': 0.1111111111111111, 'sadness': 0.044444444444444446, 'disgust': 0.022222222222222223, 'joy': 0.07777777777777778, 'anticipation': 0.06666666666666667}",Positive,positive
jjt257d,0,r_31415,2023-05-11 19:41:31,"> what i'm emphasizing is that neurodiversity exists and the fact that I'm able to teach myself things more effectively than other people isn't necessarily reflective of a character flaw those people suffer from but rather a learned skill I have cultivated. Just because I had to engage with a particular struggle to acquire certain skills doesn't mean that struggle and those skills are intertwined.

""Neurodiversity"" is not the same as ""I can't learn by myself"" or ""I can't think by myself,"" so your point seems unrelated to what we were discussing. Furthermore, as I said before, by interacting with ChatGPT, you're not really learning anything. You're simply acquiring disjoint knowledge that creates an illusion of learning because knowing things is not the same as understanding ideas. You do not retain much information, nor do you make many mistakes, or rather, the algorithm makes the mistakes for you and you're not thinking much. I know people love shortcuts and hacks to avoid putting in some effort, but at the end of the day, if you want to learn a skill or understand something complex, you have to sit down and think hard about it, and make some mistakes along the way until everything makes sense.

On your second point, don't confuse the idea that a particular skill (in your example, calligraphy) is not that important nowadays with the fact that you can automate everything without negative consequences. However, I definitely agree that LLMs are a great tool for information retrieval, which complements other tools to provide assurances about accuracy.

> You do you, but the longer you put off engaging with these tools, the more at risk you are of having the same kind of awkward relationship with future technology as my 80yo dad has with his cellphone he can barely use, despite having owned a cellphone for a decade or two now.

I engage with those tools regularly. For instance, I like the way LangChain offers tools for information retrieval. Edge's sidebar is particularly impressive for querying information within the current context of the page. I frequently experiment with new models and learning about coding new DL architectures.

jgplknp,1,Common-Maximum8431,2023-04-18 01:23:47,"I'm really bad at communicating what I believe in a nice way.. so sorry upfront.  
AI is a political subject, a serious one! But of course, that would depend on your definition of what ""political"" means. For me, anything that distributes information to 100 million users on a daily basis has the power to incrementally and slowly introduce information into any system and, with time and some external help, shape the consensus toward any subject. If you studied computer science and you got any closer to information and system theory, you know what I'm talking about.  
I also want to challenge the idea of a biology student being somehow not adequate to criticize artificial intelligence. In my own experience, some of the most powerful insights come from the intersection of different ways of explaining processes. I mean, think about how in a certain way LLMs understand everything as a language, how language becomes the code (coding) for everything. Biology is just another way of explaining things; the principles and logic are very valid, and your friend can have an understanding from a sensibility that you did not train yet.  
Also, saying that you can't tell a model what to say is just wrong. You can absolutely, completely, and without a doubt decide what, how, and when certain information is given or not given. From not subtle at all strategies like ""safeguards"" that literally spell out a predetermined answer, denying access to information inside the model, to subtle fine-tuning that would circumscribe you to certain ""clusters"" of data. I mean, you literally need to adjust a parameter called ""bias"" so you can modify the output from the model. That is how models like midjurney can now represent hands more accurately. How can you tell what other fine-tuning has been made?  
How can you know what the aggregation of billions of interactions with the model looks like each day? What ideas are being included and excluded? Did you ever ask ChatGPT about a subject that you really know about and get disappointed by how what you think is the most relevant author in that field was not included? Or a concept that was incomplete or plain wrong?  
You can't tell because you don't have access to the entire picture, but companies can strategize on all the information they collect from these interactions and from all the associated marketing data that is collected from the entire ecosystem of products they own and from all the others they pay to get the information.  
Companies will and for sure are ""pushing their agenda,"" which only means, doing business.

You are arguing with me over a non-argument. You literally don't know what he said. He had no clue what AI even was, he didn't even know the term bias, weights or anything. He simply watched a shitty conspiracy YouTube video. That's everything. That's honestly all you can read out of my comment...  


I know that biology students can criticize AI. Everyone can. The knowledge is not only available to computer scientists.

&#x200B;

But there's a fine difference between manipulating inputs, feeding in false information and straight up saying ""Yea OpenAI sits there and tells ChatGPT to say THIS exact thing at THIS exact time"". That's not how AI works.

I honestly won't watch any of these videos, because I already watched enough about this topic. I know how bias works, because as I said: I'm literally working on AI!  


Just because the point of someone COULD be right it doesn't make their opinion valid if it's based on bs. Take this as an example:  


If someone says ""Man today is so fucking hot, we need to fight climate change"" ( I know this is a casual saying which doesn't need to be analyzed, but take this in the context of a political debate) he is basically right about the climate change part. But ""that the day is hot"" part isn't necessarily a consequence of it. Sometimes it's just weather. Climate is something entirely different with influence on weather. The conclusion is right, however the rest doesn't need to be true. Just because something CAN happen it doesn't mean that shitty conspiracies are true now.

&#x200B;

If you have any doubt that he was simply talking bullshit: He later said that we are able to open a wormhole for space travel. When I asked him to explain how a wormhole works he didn't have an answer. After I explained it to him he agreed to disagree. About a scientific fact...

The answer to OP's question as asked, is NO. It is not available to train.  GPT and other models are available.

If you KNOW you are only guessing, why comment in this manner? Or why start off with a negative?

>chatGPT is of 175 billion of parameters. Anything with that size already requires specially built architecture no individual could afford.

That wasn't the question OP is asking and is not relevant to the answer. OP seems to have a firmer grasp than you do. OP just did not know if ChatGPT was *also* available.

>not in the sense of retraining the model.

OP did not say retraining. No one says retraining.  Use proper terms if you are going to pretend to know what you are talking about.

GPT can be trained, the extra data stays in the cloud.  There are 1000's of companies and individuals training it and that have trained it, that is why you see so many websites (if looking) that have ""AI"" based tools.  Resume builders, PowerPoint builders etc..

There are three (probably more) ways to interact with GPT models other than just going to the wesbite

1. You act as a middle man, just sending prompts via API http
2. You prepare/prepend prompts specifically tailored to the desired output and complete with 1.
3. You train your own data to facilitate a wider and specific range of output and complete with 1, 2 and your key.

I left my comment with some ambiguity was because even if you cannot update the base parameters, but you can still â€œfine tuneâ€ it by locking up parts of the context vector or they would allow your corpus to feed into some encoder to get some latent variables, and concat the prompt with the latent variables into the model.

In my experience, ChatGPT is best used to smoothen the initial learning experience to something new for you. For example, I will ask it the stupidest questions I can think of when I start learning a new programming language. I will ask it to draw a comparison with a language I already know. I will also ask it to debug the ""obvious"" errors or ask it how I can do something that would be ""obvious"" to a semi proficient person in that domain. ChatGPT doesn't falter here. It can understand your question very well( it's a great query parser) and let you know in simple terms the bare minimum about a topic you have no idea at all.

Another example where I find using ChatGPT effective, is to simply ask a programming documentation specific implementation detail about some commonly used library. Say I have some specific question about how boto3 (AWS python SDK) client for an AWS service behaves under specific conditions. ChatGPT will more than likely get you the correct information instead of you having to skim through the documentation to find stuff relevant to you.

jcfxfsi,2,Guilty_Recognition52,2023-03-16 11:31:38,"First I'd like clarify the premise. It's not really possible to have a useful language model that is *only* trained on a smaller specialized dataset. It would not be able to understand your questions without having the ""background knowledge"" from huge amounts of training data.

But that doesn't mean that you can't customize the behavior to *focus* on your dataset.

There are two high-level techniques for this: **transfer learning** and **prompt engineering**. They can be used individually or in combination but you probably only want to start with one if you're new to this kind of programming.

Transfer learning means you are providing new *labeled* training data and actually adjusting the weights of the model so that it answers differently to the same question. Labeled data in this context means that you have text structured in the format of a user saying something in chat + the chatbot responding appropriately. In my experience people rarely have their data already formatted like that, so transfer learning is more difficult. But if you did have data structured that way this would be the best practice. For OpenAI (maker of ChatGPT) they call it ""fine-tuning"" (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)

Prompt engineering means you are carefully creating a prompt that tells the model more about the kind of answer you want. Whereas transfer learning changes how the model responds to the same question, prompt engineering changes the question. You can do this programmatically and use various techniques to provide useful context based on your specialized dataset. Then you send the question using the standard API endpoints (/chat or /completions for OpenAI).

The editor lost all formatting for code. See is the VS modal you're using can support markdown.

I suspect you are prompt engineering/appending prompts to the user input. This created extremely low quality spaghetti code, lacking any funcs, abstraction, or really usability. And it include inline comments for every line of code. This is not something chatGPT does with my prompt, it consistently produced usable code when prompted in chatGPT.

&#x200B;

For the chatGPT setting I would drop all attempts at your prompt engineering. This would certainly eliminate the low quality code issue. Also with the short term memory it's not necessary, if I as a user don't get what I want from ChatGPT I can ask it to correct  the output in human language.

\- drop the attempt at prompt engineering for chatGPT option

To reach a recursive â€œintelligence explosionâ€ we only need a model better at programing the comparatively narrow domain of machine learning models than current scientists. 

I strongly feel that this is an inflection point. Previous models where not smart enough for this.

I didn't run any of the code and just scanned through it to see how well it did, as I'm not very familiar with PyTorch. I have spent most of my time with TensorFlow. But you have to admit that GPT3 did pretty well. I find that it does in fact get a lot of things wrong, but what it gets right is impressive. But it does get things wrong and you have to be careful when using it.

When trying to think this through, you realize a few things. Most importantly, the only reason I can read through the article and code and think this is because I have spent the last few years intensively digging into AI/ML, post-grad courses, online courses, researching ways to use ML for the last 10-years or so, and I have been working in IT for the last 30-years. For the last 10-years I have had a side project of trying to use AI/ML to improve compiler optimization. Our experiances are what gives us the ability and insight to read the code and think through the process. GPT3 can't do that for us. Well, at least not yet. If you are unfamiliar with ML/DL, you'd have a hard time figure out what is going on here. So GPT3 in this case is more of a helper than anything.

Also, you are getting 91% accuracy, which is good. But not good enough for production. But now you have to spend time on improving it. There are ANN generated models that get much higher, as high as 99.8% without being overfitted. So, you still have a LOT of work to do. What would it take for GPT3 to optimize this to get 99.8%? I'm not sure it can. That would be an impressive part 2 of the article... using ChatGPT to improve the accuracy, reduce overfitting, fine tuning, etc., etc. 

My point is, something like this cannot replace the skilled data scientist or programmer, but it can signficantly speed up the process of developing new code.

""Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. It is useful because it can allow you to take advantage of the ***knowledge learned from the first task and apply it to the second task, potentially improving the performance of the model on the second task***.

""Transfer learning is commonly used in deep learning, where a model trained on a large dataset can be fine-tuned for a specific task by updating the model's weights with new data. This can be ***more efficient than training a model from scratch on a small dataset***, because the pre-trained model has already learned some useful features that can be transferable to the new task.

""Transfer learning can be useful in a variety of applications, such as natural language processing, image classification, and speech recognition. ***It can be especially beneficial when there is a limited amount of labeled data available for the second task.""***

\-----------------

""To use transfer learning to improve ChatGPT on your specific dataset, you can follow these steps:

""Pre-process your dataset: You will need to clean, filter, and organize your dataset to make it ready for training. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring that your data is in a suitable format for the model.

""Use ChatGPT's pre-trained model as a starting point for your own task.

""Fine-tune the model on your specific dataset: Using the pre-trained ChatGPT model, fine-tune it on your specific dataset by adjusting the model's hyperparameters and training it on your data. This will allow the model to adapt to your specific use case and improve its performance.

""Evaluate the model: After training and fine-tuning the model, you should evaluate its performance on your specific dataset. This will help you understand how well the model is able to generate responses that are relevant and appropriate for your task.

""It is important to carefully evaluate the model's performance and ensure that it is able to generate appropriate responses for your specific use case.""

j7gtziw,1,vannak139,2023-02-06 13:25:32,"As far as chatGPT goes, its answer is fine, I guess, perhaps a bit narrow. To simply say that positional encodings don't effect the semantics of word embeddings is fine to consider as True or False, but if you're going to say the semantics aren't effected you should probably focus on mentioning what does change, what improves, or else why even bother doing this? So its answer isn't foundationally wrong, just narrow. 



Point-wise addition is great in a lot of circumstances, that it deals with missing data is just a bonus. The best way to consider that specific benefit is considering how a ""missing data"" labels will have to work, compared to added embeddings. The critical thing is, even if you train a ""missing label"" embedding, it'll still be uniform across all unknown examples. With stacked embeddings, this won't necessarily be the case. However, point-wise addition of embeddings can be good even without any missing data. There's lots of perspectives that you can take on this, from considering how this effects the gradient, to how it deals with vector space mappings. Its difficult to pin down a single specific reason or condition where point-wise addition works.   


That said, I'm most often considering how the elements contribute to the semantics I think are reasonable, as well as the correlation between events- the qualities of the coincidence matrix. In the location sub-category type, you'd have a very very sparse co-incidence matrix between States and Cities, and I generally take this to imply that concatenating will not be viable. Adding is a good alternative here. Different embeddings, like Product Category and Location, seem more worthwhile to concatenate perhaps because their co-incidence matrix is relatively dense and higher population. I vaguely relate this to the number and diversity of samples each independent embedding vector is trained on. So you could train on D1xD2xD3xP1xP2, and have a very large low density space. Or, you could train on the space spanned by (D1+D2+D3)x(P1+P2), and have a smaller space with higher density, which probably helps generalization, i guess?",learnmachinelearning,"{'fear': 0.1702127659574468, 'anger': 0.0, 'anticip': 0.0, 'trust': 0.0851063829787234, 'surprise': 0.1276595744680851, 'positive': 0.19148936170212766, 'negative': 0.1702127659574468, 'sadness': 0.10638297872340426, 'disgust': 0.0, 'joy': 0.06382978723404255, 'anticipation': 0.0851063829787234}",Positive,positive
