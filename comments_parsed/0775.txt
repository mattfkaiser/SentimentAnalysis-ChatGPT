>Apologies for the confusion. Upon reviewing the quoted text again, I see that it does indeed include a personal anecdote. The specific mention of being a freelance writer, experiencing flagged writing, and being let go from clients and agencies due to accusations provides a personal account that may not align with typical AI-generated text. Therefore, I retract my previous statement that the quoted text was generated by an AI. It appears to be a human-authored text that includes personal experiences and perspectives from individuals within the freelance writing community.
