This is especially problematic for social or health sciences (Like psychology), because it can incidentally create misinformation in field that often garners a lot of interest from lay people."
"ChatGPT does use reinforcement learning with a dynamically updated reward model as part of the process of fine tuning the unsupervised language model. It may not technically be a GAN depending on the precise definition, but it's definitely similar (excluding the other training steps)."
A fundamentally more important point in this case is that ChatGPT is not even designed or trained to perform this function.
"It's crazy how many people seem to think ""I asked ChatGPT if it could do X, and it said it can do X, so therefore it can do X"" is a valid line of reasoning.
