>	If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters."
"The way I see ChatGPT is that it can give answers that reflect the ""group consensus"" on a given topic. No, it doesn't know anything but if you ask it how to write a funny joke or how to become a professional chess player it will parrot the thousands upon thousands of user posts giving such advice, but in a neat and condensed form. It is *very* useful, as long as it is understood as a sort of mirror of society rather than a thinking entity of its own."
"Why are you yelling at internet people? ChatGPT is way more impressive than you give it credit for. There are enormous amounts of information on the internet, and it's growing at an incredible rate - way beyond what any human could consume much less try to meaningfully aggregate. The fact that a bot like this can take so much information and use it give meaningful answers in real time is amazing - and it keeps improving. There is a massive potential in that. No one is claiming ChatGPT is the singularity."
"Meanwhile ChatGPT has increased my productivity by orders of magnitude. I'm a software engineer that's been in the business 20+ years and around this time last year I decided I wanted to found a company. My career has focused mostly on low level camera software. I wanted to leverage this to build an app that could do a lot of good for people.
