You will see a list of autosaved versions of your document. You can open any of these versions to see the changes made at that point.
If you haven't been using OneDrive or SharePoint, Word does not automatically save previous versions of your document. However, it does automatically save a copy of your document every few minutes in case of a crash. This is called an AutoRecover file.
