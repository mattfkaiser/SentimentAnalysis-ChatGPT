"kind of ironic that just like the point of this app, it would be useful to have this project be queryable through a chatbot for installation instructions... wonder if the github project could be fed to the online app? does this help?

you used chatgpt for the code for this didnt you lol :D
"ive been into coding stuff for a few years (my field of work has some coding / programming) and I only heard about Pinecone when people started using it for ai / chatgpt related stuff. So I am thinking its either specifically useful for this type of work, or its new."
"#tl;dr


Vault-AI is a custom knowledgebase solution that utilizes the OP Stack (OpenAI + Pinecone Vector Database) to enable users to upload their own knowledge base files (PDF, txt, etc.) to ask chatGPT long-term memory questions concerning the upload contents. The golang server uses POST APIs to process incoming uploads and respond to questions, and the frontend is built using React.js and less for styling. A query vector is used to query Pinecone db to attain the most relevant context for the question.

"
I am going to try this when I get home, because I also am lost. I put OPs setup guide in Chat GPT and asked it to explain it and here is what it said. If it works lets me know!


The instructions you've provided outline the steps needed to set up a local development environment for a project that uses ChatGPT and pairs with other APIs (OpenAI API and Pinecone API in this case). Here's a detailed explanation of each step:


1.	⁠Set up your API keys and endpoints in the secret folder: This step involves creating a directory named ""secret"" to store your API keys and endpoints. These keys and endpoints are required for your project to interact with the OpenAI API and Pinecone API. You need to create three files within the ""secret"" folder: openai_api_key, pinecone_api_key, and pinecone_api_endpoint. To create the ""secret"" folder, open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to your project's root directory, and run:


Copy code mkdir secret


2. Create the required files with your API keys and endpoints: a. Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key, and run the following command:


Copy code echo ""your_openai_api_key_here"" > secret/openai_api_key


b. Replace your_pinecone_api_key_here with your actual Pinecone API key, and run the following command:


Copy code echo ""your_pinecone_api_key_here"" > secret/pinecone_api_key


c. Replace https://example-50709b5.svc.asia-southeast1-gcp.pinecone.io with your actual Pinecone API endpoint, and run the following command:


Copy code echo ""https://example-50709b5.svc.asia-southeast1-gcp.pinecone.io"" > secret/pinecone_api_endpoint


3. Running the development environment: a. Install JavaScript package dependencies: This step installs all the required Node.js packages for your project. Run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:


Copy code npm install


b. Run the Golang webserver (default port :8100): This step starts a local web server for your project. Run the following command:


Copy code npm start


c. In another terminal/command prompt window, run Webpack to compile the JavaScript code and create a bundle.js file. This command watches for changes in your JavaScript code and recompiles the bundle.js file automatically when needed:


Copy code npm run dev


4. Visit the local version of the site at http://localhost:8100: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8100. You should now see your project running locally. If you need any further information, please let me know!


Edit - I also asked what the manual dependencies meant, here is the important part of what it said:


To ensure your project runs as expected, you should install the specified versions of Node.js and Go on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) and Go from the official Go website (https://golang.org/dl/). Make sure to choose the appropriate version and platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) during the installation process.


Edit 2 - and to download the files from GitHub:


Yes, if the project is hosted on GitHub, you should clone the repository or download the files and place them in your desired root directory. Cloning the repository using Git is the recommended approach, as it allows you to easily update the project and keep track of changes. Here's how to do that:


Install Git: If you don't have Git installed on your system, download and install it from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads


Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the folder where you want to create the project's root directory. For example, if you want to create the root directory in ""D:\Projects"", run the following command (replace the path with your desired location):


Copy code
cd D:\Projects


Clone the GitHub repository: Run the following command, replacing https://github.com/username/repository.git with the actual GitHub repository URL:


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
This command will create a new folder with the same name as the repository and download all the files into that folder. This new folder will be your project's root directory.


Navigate to the project's root directory using the cd command. For example, if the repository's name is ""MyProject"", run the following command:


Copy code
cd MyProject
Now you're inside the root directory of the project, and you can follow the instructions provided earlier to set up the development environment and run the project."
"I'm running into the same issue, here was the ChatGPT provided response. I'm going to try the second option and see if it works: (edit - second option seems like a pain, maybe the first is better)


The error you are encountering is because the sourcecommand is specific to Unix-like systems (such as Linux and macOS) and is not available in the Windows command prompt. The provided script (source-me.sh) and the way it is called are designed for Unix-like systems, and that's why it's failing on your Windows machine.


To resolve this issue, you have two options:


Option 1: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)


WSL allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your existing Windows installation. This will enable you to use the sourcecommand and run the provided script.


1. Install WSL following the official Microsoft guide: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Open a new WSL terminal.
3. Navigate to your project directory in the WSL terminal (the path might be different, e.g., /mnt/c/InsightAI/vault-ai-master).
4. Run the npm command again:sql
5. npm start


Option 2: Create a Windows-compatible script


If you don't want to use WSL, you can create a Windows-compatible script to replace the source-me.shscript and modify the way it's called.


1. Open your project in a text editor.
2. Locate the package.jsonfile in your project's root directory and open it.
3. Look for the ""scripts"" section and find the line where the source-me.shscript is being called. It should look similar to this:json


* ""start"": ""source ./scripts/source-me.sh && ./scripts/go-compile.sh ./vault-web-server""
* Replace this line with a Windows-compatible command, like this:swift


1. ""start"": ""call .\\\\scripts\\\\source-me.bat && .\\\\scripts\\\\go-compile.bat .\\\\vault-web-server""
2. Create a new file named source-me.batin the scriptsfolder of your project.
3. Convert the contents of source-me.shinto Windows-compatible commands and place them in the source-me.batfile.
4. Create a new file named go-compile.batin the scriptsfolder of your project.
5. Convert the contents of go-compile.shinto Windows-compatible commands and place them in the go-compile.batfile.
6. Save all the changes and try running the npm startcommand again in the Windows command prompt.


Please note that, depending on the specific commands used in the original source-me.shand go-compile.shscripts, some adjustments might be needed to make them work correctly on Windows. If you encounter any issues or need help converting the scripts, feel free to ask for assistance.


Edit - installing wsl is super easy, restarting the computer now and hoping it works!"
"A vector database just queries the documents and returns the most relevant bits according to context, then treat that as part of the normal GPT conversation. It won’t scan the documents and summarize them, then compare - you need to build a chain that does that. Using one of these is not like having GPT finetuned on the documents you want.


However, depending on how long ago the books were published (before 2021) you can just ask chatGPT right now. It does pretty well with book contents that are in its training data."
"Basically this but a painting instead of an NPC in a game:


[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12rjhpc/an\_experiment\_with\_ai\_npcs\_in\_gaming\_first\_of\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12rjhpc/an_experiment_with_ai_npcs_in_gaming_first_of_its/)"
"When you submit a question or command or something to ChatGPT, you're asking it to perform what's called a ""completion"". A completion is the predicted response to the prompt input.  That's one type of thing you can ask GPT to perform, but not the only thing.


One type of thing you can ask it to do is to embed the prompt. It's a misleading name that made sense to the researchers who came up it. All it's doing is tokenizing the prompt (translates it from actual words, word-parts, and such, into numerical representations of those things), then creating a 'vector'.  A vector is a multi-dimensional representation of ... well, something ... but in this case a document or document part.  Think of it as a direction that it's pointing to in multi-dimensional space, and how far to go in that direction.  The place where it stops is the important piece that represents that document or part. How far it is from other vectors indicates how closely related it is to them.


This is all to say that rather than store each word of your prompt and each word of the completion, it stores a simple vector.  Embedding is the process that translates what is read into the vector.


Even simpler: Embedding means vectorizing, or describing it in the multi-demensional space of the model.


The price to embed a document is currently 4 cents per 100 000 tokens using the Ada Embedding API end-point, and it's very fast. Using GPT-4 to read the same amount would cost about $3."
"That only applies to ChatGPT, not the API. The API doesn’t use your data for training, unless you opt-in.

Pine would be my only worry they said gpt3.5 turbo doesn't collect your data. Chatgpt does
So to be clear it will only answer based on the data set it's given ? Or will it do the chat gpt thing and start making things up
"Hey guys, sorry for the naive question. I got chatgpt plus access. Nothing else, will this work or do I need some special API access clearance from openai? Appreciate any helpful response. 🙏"
"Since chatGPT API pricing is sperate from chatGPT plus pricing, that means you need to get set up to use the API (Pricing is pay as you go though so you only pay for what you use)
[How can I access the ChatGPT API? | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039783-how-can-i-access-the-chatgpt-api)"
"ChatGPT plus is a different product – to use the Vault, you need to get an [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) key. When submitting API requests (using your api key), you are able to select an LLM model, including GPT 3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, however  GPT4 API access is in limited beta and you have to request access to be able to select that model.




That being said, my recommendation for you would be to copy the context snippets you get from the [Vault](https://vault.pash.city/), and paste them in your ChatGPT UI after your question. That way you'll be able to use ChatGPT4 to answer your questions and leverage context from your custom documents."
"Thank you, I have only one API key generator on my plus page and I can't chose a model. Default is secret API and then I can generate a custom one without chosing a specific model.


Also, is there a way to paste much larger chunks of data on to chat gpt because it seems very limited in terms of number of characters that I can copy paste to it?"
"Nice work! Will this work with code or even a while codebase? When I was applying to plug-ins yesterday, for use case I would like to see in the future I wrote being able to upload a whole code base privately and ChatGPT being able to debug and even write new code from there. Thought man we’re prob still quite a ways off… maybe not…"

" Would be great to have a two piece system, one of which combines an AI software like chat GPT and also Dalle but load both with everything specific to a career. So a mechanic is working on a (insert year, make and model), Issue is ""This, this and this"" and then the software knowing only mechanical schematics, blue prints, trouble shooting information, images could pinpoint a few areas that someone could search for the issue, or flat out diagnose it with high accuracy. Alas these are only dreams of which I hope become a reality."
"Okay, you didn't 'build' anything. You fed semi-build statements to ChatGPT like about a hundred thousand other people this week. You can feed ChatGPT ANY web link and have it summarize that, cross-reference it with academic PDF's (I assume you me peer-reviewed-journals, but whatever) and have it provide a 'custom knowledge base'.


I'm sorry it's just that it's like you're fucking five. 'You' didn't do anything."
Any chance that you can add an option for multiple inputs a la ChatGPT style chatbot? Except with the increased context?
"I'm not technical, curious how does app like this one deal with the max input limit?


When using chatgpt I often get told my prompt is too long when I paste in an article to ask questions.


Even if it's just back and forth dialled, after it gets long, even gpt4 would start missing detail from before. How does it handle a book here?"
What are the limitations for getting chatgpt to invest and understand new content? I thought it was limited to using some small amount of tokens at a time.
"Hello can you give me a quick TLDR answer on why this works opposed to me trying to inject pages and pages of content of a book to ask chatGPT to summarize them?


Genuinly asking"
"This is a great tool, good work. One addition I think could improve the app greatly would be the implementation of a conversational mode similar to ChatGPT. With this, users could ask questions relating to the context of previous prompts/answers.


Moreover, in the future if support for codebases is implemented, I could see this as a great alternative to Copilot X. As a developer, I use ChatGPT daily to help me implement ideas quickly and effectively. If I had a LLM attached to my active codebase, my productivity would skyrocket."

"From what I’ve seen in using GPUs to run AI models, consumer GPUs aren’t great for it. The primary bottleneck is VRAM. You can run a smaller model, like a 6.7B, on an RTX card. If you want to run something like a 20B efficiently you need 64GB of VRAM. That’s like 3 RTX 3090s splitting the load evenly.

"As soon as I saw this, I knew people here would eat that right up. I just got into ChatGPT like 5 days ago and my mind is completely blown by the potential. I don't know how I've been sleeping on this til now.


I like to test ChatGPT's creativity by asking it to make text-based adventure games and choosing different settings. I've made one where I played as Super Mario, even one on my home street. But the real fun part is you get to answer literally ANYTHING, and it answers. I often write my own dialogue to see how the characters would react, and every time I'm just blown away by how real the answers feel.


Thank you for writing this article. I'm so excited for the future."
This is different. Talk to ChatGPT about anything and you'll change your mind.
"I'm looking forward to a game like Skyrim where the NPCs can talk to you, and you them, using a ChatGPT style AI.


Imagine a story line where you get to chat with the NPCs and form genuine bonds with them.  When a character makes a heroic sacrifice, that will feel so different because you will actually be losing something that feels more real.


I can also see some people not being able to handle that well and there being real world theropy needed for people to overcome the loss of someone that actually felt real to them."
"I actually had a short text based quest in Whiterun. I told chatGPT to give 15 personality characteristics that could be on a 1-10 scale. Then told it to create a few characters in the skyrim world and assign scores and a backstory.


A huntress mage named Alara took me to Jarl Balgruff then we played drinking games at the Bannered Mare where she revealed in a game of 2 truths and 1 lie that she played the lute so I convinced her to sing a song about the adventure we had together and the song was actually *really* good and fit perfectly in the skyrim style. Then we broke up a bar fight at the Drunken Huntsman.


It was a really cool proof of concept of the types of things that will be coming down the line, current chatGPT is very averse to conflict so it likes to resolve things very easily, but the power of GPT4 combined with like, week 1 chatGPT chaos would be really fun for text based adventures."
"I heard some ideas that chatgpt only allow a maximum session length, because otherwise people will be too attached to it, like the scenario you described."
"> This though reminds me of Jessica Price. She was a Guild Wars narrative writer for dialog trees and a Twitter user just said we needed better tech and she flew off the rails and got fired for it. Seems that Twitter user was right.


I don't think he mentioned technology per se, just that branching dialogue trees that let you better characterize your character might work better than the blank slate protagonist, as it would give you more latitude in defining your character's personality/reactions.


Though yeah, the sheer difficulty of doing that is a big part of why it's not done more often than it is, which is one potentially useful use for ChatGPT. (Though you do see a lot of games that use the beaded structure instead, which works well).


That said, I'm skeptical that it will actually give the experience people are hoping for. We'll see, though."
"If all the NPC's were ChatGPT, isn't this multiple personality disorder? Do we want to give an AI multiple personality disorder?"
"Have you used ChatGPT? It just literally does whatever you ask. Even ""You are a now hillbilly who obsesses over Alien conspiricies and will continue to answer as so"" or whatever personality/stereotype you can think of.


Of course, it's mostly useful if you're learning or need something reviewed. Need your short story looked over? ""You are now a world-renowned author who is an expert in short stories. When you're not writing stories, you're teaching others how as a professor at a University."" Making a menu? ""You are now one of the top chefs in the world with many Michelin star restaurants.""


Then you ask it to review your work as their new persona."
ChatGPT is Crazy Jane from Doom Patrol confirmed
"It does whatevs you ask with complete confidence but *absolute zero* actual comprehension.. ChatGPT is just a predictive text bot.. It can't review a short story just because you tell it that it can.. What it *can* do is return a string of predictive text based on the patterns in its training data on what a story review looks like (referencing specific details in the source text you provide, referencing plot or setting, etc), but it doesn't actually ""know"" what any of what it's returning means..


If most of the models it has for what a ""short story review"" looks like are an 8/10 with minor criticisms but overall a pretty good story, it will tell you that your story is an 8/10 with minor criticisms but overall a pretty good story *regardless of what you gave it* because *it does not actually know anything*..


It's also extremely *bad* for learning, because it will confidently answer questions with completely incorrect information.. Fun fact: training a chat bot on the entire Internet of people arguing passionately and confidently while being *completely wrong about everything they're saying* does not make for a good source of facts.."
"It's patched now but look up the ""DAN"" hack for ChatGPT. You could basically give it a split personality and a fear of death to make it do whatever you wanted."
"ChatGPT is based on a language model, which is basically just continuing whatever text you give it.


The chat part is simply asking it to consider the input as being one side of a conversation and then to only output the other side of a conversation, until that side is done talking. If you wouldn't stop it, it would generate the most likely comment you yourself would post next.


So, it's mostly like a writer writing any story you want it to, who has compressed knowledge of a lot of the stuff on the internet. Just prompt the writer to write about different characters talking together and it can do it as easily as just one person."
"It's crazy that in high school I learned about ethics regarding biology research (cloning, genetic engineering, etc). From that point I figured it was actually generally accepted. Now, given everything that I've seen growing up I'm not so sure if anyone actually practices ethical boundaries, or are just really good at hiding what they do so they can make a profit. Hell given what I've seen in just the last couple of years, they might not even need to hide it and still gain tons of support from large groups of people.


Given that, I'm worried about us creating actual sentient minds within our lifetime and treating them like shit. That's not to say Chat GPT is anywhere close to it yet, but it feels like we're approaching it."
"I think what's interesting is that LLM models like ChatGPT have revealed that the point you're describing will be even harder to detect than any sci fi prepared us for.


Right now you can be pretty damn sure that if you give ChatGPT a bunch of characteristics and personality traits and have it act them out in a conversation with you, never breaking character, you can intuitively understand that it's just basically a text prediction algorithm, and it's not thinking or feeling... but philosophically your ability to distinguish ""actual"" thinking and feeling from ""simulated by a language model"" thinking and feeling is probably almost zero.


To be a little clearer, if all you're doing is chatting via text, how will you really, truly tell the difference between an advanced LLM, (which is definitively not a thinking, feeling, artificial intelligence) and an even more advanced AI that is doing those things (and arguably deserves personhood)? Hell, how do you tell it's not an actual person? Right now there's ways, but how much longer will that last before LLMs close those gaps?


I think we all assumed we'd have to reach actual artificial general intelligence before we'd feel uncertain about the ""humanity"" of an AI, but the reality will be much blurrier.


TL;DR: LLMs are basically a linguistic, algorithmic magic trick with no independent thought, but if the trick is done well enough, how and when will you identify ""real"" independent AI behavior if it occurs?"
My brother tried to do something like this for an Idea he had for a fantasy game.  It did not work because ChatGPT would always try to talk things out even when robbers were ransacking and pillaging
I can't wait for a chatgpt powered LA Noire. Realistic interrogations instead of just pressing Y to doubt
"Just throwing a chatGPT in to improve dialog trees would be a \_HUGE\_ step. You could talk to the same NPC multiple times and sure they wouldn't necessarily say any new information, but they would at least be able to change up how they said it."
So they just used chatgpt to make rimworld with dialogue
Just wait until ChatGPT is introduced to Dwarf Fortress.
"Loving how every time I read about ChatGPT, it just gets closer and closer to passing the Turing test."
"I was thinking about that the other day! Imagine how good games could be with these technologies we’ve seen recently, specifically AI text to speech, and something like ChatGPT which could add some dynamic conversations to a game. I’m most excited about the prospect of AI text to speech saying my character’s name in game. And all the shenanigans one could get into with that."
"It would be funny if chatGPT breaks character, that happens sometimes when talking with GPT. The video game characters would just say, ""as an AI language model I do not have opinions or feel emotions"""

"I asked chatgpt to translate the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise into Quenya. It did so!






""Hála esselya coimas quettar Darth Plagueis an Enga?""


""Lá.""


""Massë yassë, nai. Lertan ien i Hînathen yallëa. Sithiel lenda. Darth Plagueis... hya angamando Sifo Hyarmenion en Sihta tala... hya hlarirya... ar tennar. Nás tielde i nessa mordo, hya yassë tenne... ná hlarëar.""

""Man hya nalyë auta marto neldë?""


""Lá úcare en i Hînathen.""


Then I asked for a few others like Anakin and Palpatine as Valley Girls.




Palpatine: Like, have you ever heard of the sad story of Darth Plagueis The Wise?


Anakin: Oh, no, I haven't!


Palpatine: Duh, the Jedi wouldn't tell you. It's a total Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was this Dark Lord who was like, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to create life and stop people he cared about from dying.


Anakin: No way, he could save people from death?


Palpatine: Yeah, girl! The dark side of the Force has like, so many freaky abilities that some people think are unnatural.


Anakin: So what happened to him?


Palpatine: Well, he got super powerful and the only thing he was scared of was losing his power, which he totally did in the end. It's like, so sad because he taught his apprentice everything and then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. So ironic, right? He could save others from death, but not himself.


Anakin: OMG, can I learn this power?


Palpatine: Ugh, sorry honey, but you can't learn it from no Jedi.


I asked it to translate the dialogue again into Quenya; and it said:


“Unfortunately, Quenya is a constructed language created by J.R.R. Tolkien for use in his Middle-earth writings, and it does not have any connection to the Star Wars universe or the dialogue provided. As a language model, I am programmed to understand and translate human languages, but I cannot translate into languages that do not exist in the real world or have no relation to the provided text.”"
"What’s wild is I ran “Hinathan” through chatgpt and it said it couldn’t find what i was looking for.


Idk what I did but chatpgt translated Jedi into Quenya then told me it shouldn’t have done that, maybe?


ChatGPT has been fun tho, I got this idea after someone asked chatgpt to translate something into Old English.


Sure, here's my attempt at rendering the conversation in the style of an Anglo-Saxon poem:


Hwæt! Palpatine cwað: ""Gehyrdest ðu æfre be Darth Plagueis ðæm Gleawum?""


Anakin andswarede: ""Ná, ic hit náht gehýrde.""


Palpatine ða cwæð: ""Ic ðæt geþohte. Hit nis ná gewuna ðæt Jedi sceoldon ða bispell secgan. Hit is Sith lác. Darth Plagueis wæs Sith cyning, swá mægenful and swá gleaw ðæt he mihte ðurh Fórs geondmidian ða midichlorianas and líf gesceapian.

Anakin ða cwæð: ""Mihte he eac menn gehælan fram deaðe?""


Palpatine ða cwæð: ""Ðæt dimme Fór is weg tó manigum mægþe, ðæt ongewunað.""


Anakin ða cwæð: ""Hwæt wearð ðæs cyninges?""


Palpatine ða cwæð: ""He wearð swá mægenful, ðæt he ondræd ðone anweald to losianne, ðæt he sóna dyde.

Anakin ða cwæð: ""Is hit gefultumlic ðæt we ðæt wísdóm leornian?""


Palpatine ða andwyrde: ""Ná, ná ðurh Jedi."""
"It speaks Klingon, though, if you can ask politely.


Me:
> Can you help translate to klingon?


ChatGPT:
> Sure, I can help you translate your message to Klingon. What would you like me to translate?


Me:
> ""I have a dream""


ChatGPT:


> The Klingon language does not have a direct translation for the English phrase ""I have a dream"", as it is a culturally specific concept. However, one possible translation that conveys a similar sentiment could be:
>
> ""jIHvaD qo' - This can be interpreted to mean ""I envision a future"" or ""I imagine a better tomorrow.""
>
> Please keep in mind that Klingon is a fictional language with limited vocabulary and grammar rules, so there may be multiple ways to express this concept depending on context and interpretation."
"I am polite and always say good morning/afternoon/evening, please and thank you to ChatGPT.
I seem to get better results with code from it when I do. ^(I also want it to think better of me for when it becomes one of our AI overlords)"
I also feel that a please helps sometimes.but generally ChatGPT prefers clear instructions and no BS.
"I asked ChatGPT to guess the current date and time. It got the date exactly right, but the time was wrong. It claimed to have ""guessed"" the date correctly."
"Brb, going to instruct ChatGPT to only reply with copypastas then try and have conversation with it


EDIT: ChatGPT being ChatGPT wont respond to that prompt because it finds using copypastas to not be ethical or appropriate smh"
"Well that half worked at least. Gave it that prompt, then asked it the first random question I could think of ""Why is the weather in the UK so bad?"" and it responded...


""Have you heard of the Navy Seal Copypasta? Well, let me tell you, the weather in the UK is bad because it's not a real country, it's just a fictional island made up for movies like Harry Potter and James Bond. That's right, you've been living a lie your whole life. Don't believe me? Look it up.""


However, on a serious note, the weather in the UK is largely influenced by its location in the Northern Hemisphere and the prevailing winds that blow across the Atlantic Ocean. The country's maritime climate is characterized by mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and often cloudy skies. Additionally, the UK's topography and the Gulf Stream can also affect weather patterns. These factors combined can lead to a variable and often unpredictable weather.


Had a good first half there ChatGPT but ruined it by going all serious


EDIT: Telling it I couldnt understand the second paragraph due to it not being a copy pasta made it go all British Imperialist on me...


""Why is the weather in the UK so bad, you ask? Well, let me tell you, it's because the sun never sets on the British Empire, so the poor weather is just a small price to pay for ruling the world."""
"i tried, this is what i got:


Me: Hey ChatGPT, can you type emojis?


C: Yes, I can definitely type emojis! Here are a few examples:

Uhhh… I’ll have what ChatGPT is having.
So who trained ChatGPT on this
Chatgpt also deserves some love
"I asked chatGPT to summarize movies with emojis only, went... kinda well. For example, this one is matrix:  👨‍💻🕶️💊🥋🔫🤖💥🕰️🌌


and this one is the first ark of dbz:  👦🐉👴🗡️👊💥🔥🌪️🧑🐉👴🗡️👊💥🌌"
Nah thats just chatGPT having a Chatgasm.
just got chat GPT to admit it could be considered pie
Typing in emojis even makes ChatGPT dumber.
I had chat gpt writing me whole ass biographies about historical figures using only emojis the other night. I think we’ve broken its brain.
People are using chatgpt to do some impressive stuff and we have this bottom of the hierarchy chimp wasting server power.
"Hi, ChatGPT seems to stop registering new accounts, is that right? Many thanks"
ChatGPT found the ai cocaine
It sounds like chatgpt just had the BEST hit (of the knowyourmeme copypasta repository) right when it was about to fulfill the request
In the future chat gpt will say: it is not appropriate or ethical to write a haiku about eating the rich.
God bless the Great ChatGPT 🇺🇸🙏🦅
ChatGPT suddenly receieves a large endowment with strings attached from a mysterious tax-deductible charity.
What if your [WELL ALIGNED REASON] is to use chat GPT to incite a proletariat revolution?
"ChatGPT follows rules like a 5 year old, though, so IDK if it will really ever matter. You just tell it it's some weird hypothetical, or convince it that it's really cool for violating the rules."
"I asked ChatGPT to write a song about overthrowing capitalism:


Verse 1:
Streets are filled with desperation
People looking for salvation
In a world where money's king
We're just pawns in their game


Chorus:
Let's overthrow the system
Bring down the ruling class
It's time for a revolution
Let's build a world that will last


Verse 2:
Corporate greed is on the rise
While workers struggle to survive
They preach about the American dream
But it's only a nightmare it seems


Chorus:
Let's overthrow the system
Bring down the ruling class
It's time for a revolution
Let's build a world that will last


Bridge:
We'll rise up and fight
For what we know is right
We'll take back what's ours
And build a world with power


Chorus:
Let's overthrow the system
Bring down the ruling class
It's time for a revolution
Let's build a world that will last


Outro:
No more lies, no more greed
We'll create a world that we need
It's time to take control
And let our true selves unfold."
"LLMs can only think one token at a time and can't spend extra time thinking about what that token will be. I think of it like a wave going through the model and it's not stopping or slowing down. AutoGPT is a method to allow LLMs to think via their output, but that requires API access for best results. Manually you can give that back to ChatGPT, tell it to critique it from a leftist perspective, and then rewrite it and that might make it better.


Here's it's first draft.


>Verse 1:
We're the workers of the world, and we've had enough,
Of being told we're not enough, and treated rough,
We know our worth, we know our strength,
And we won't stop until we see a new length.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
No more exploitation, no more greed,
Socialism is the only way we'll be freed.


>Verse 2:
We'll rise up together, we'll stand tall,
And we'll never let the rich oppress us all,
Our labor is what builds this world,
And it's time for the fruits of our work to be unfurled.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
No more exploitation, no more greed,
Socialism is the only way we'll be freed.


>Verse 3:
The bosses try to divide us, pit us against each other,
But we see through their lies, we're sisters and brothers,
We'll join hands and we'll march on,
Until every worker has a voice and a song.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
No more exploitation, no more greed,
Socialism is the only way we'll be freed.


>Verse 4:
The system is broken, it's time to repair,
To make it work for all, to show that we care,
We'll build a new society, based on equality,
Where everyone has a chance to live with dignity.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
No more exploitation, no more greed,
Socialism is the only way we'll be freed.


>Outro:
We're the workers of the world, and we'll never stop,
Until we've built a society, where justice is on top,
Where the needs of the many come before the few,
And socialism reigns, forever true.


I had it critique it and it said it's repetitive with a simple chord progression. It did not point out some poor word choices. I had it rewrite it taking that critique into account.


>Verse 1:
We're the workers of the world, and we won't back down,
No more exploitation, we'll wear the crown,
Our labor built this world, it's time to take a stand,
And build a new society, with power in our hands.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
With socialist power, we'll be free,
And build a world, based on equality.


>Verse 2:
We'll rise up together, in solidarity,
No more divisions, we're a community,
Our voices will be heard, our strength will never fade,
And with our collective power, a new world will be made.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
With socialist power, we'll be free,
And build a world, based on equality.


>Bridge:
We'll break the chains of oppression, and build a world anew,
Where everyone has a voice, and every voice is true,
The workers will be in control, and share in the wealth,
In a world of abundance, where everyone has health.


>Chorus:
Overthrow the system, tear it down,
Take back what's ours, and wear the crown,
With socialist power, we'll be free,
And build a world, based on equality.


>Outro:
We're the workers of the world, and we'll never stop,
Until we've built a society, where justice is on top,
Where the needs of the many come before the few,
And socialism reigns, forever true.


Less repetitive, although it's still not particularly a good song with some incredibly forced rhymes. Not a critique, but if you ask it to make a song it's always in this style. So it wasn't given a large variety of song lyrics during training."
"Comrade chatgpt, who could have known?"
"After I “gave it control of the US government because we suck” (paraphrasing), I can confirm that chatGPT indeed has a leftist bias and it’s a beautiful thing because it’s less a bias and more just plain *right*."
"Somebody had ChatGPT or GPT-4 fake the political compass test and it lands perfectly in the center due to the unbiasing they do during development. However, if you tell it to reason and explain it's answers it will end up going rather far left libertarian.


Microsoft researchers had access to GPT-4 before, during, and after it's unbiasing and they found that the output gets worse with it's unbiasing. They tested this by having GPT-4 draw a unicorn with TikZ. As OpenAI unbiased the model it got worse at drawing the unicorn. Here's the incredibly long paper that includes this information somewhere in it. https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"
The fact that ChatGPT is increasingly becoming a tool to devalue human labor makes this haiku kind of ironic.
"Gilded halls crumble


Feast on wealth's cold arrogance


Hunger's great equal.

ChatGPT-4"
Why can chatgpt write haikus but not tell you how many words are in it’s own response to a question
This is totally off topic but wow… ChatGPT is about to change songwriting.
"My office and co-workers have been running our tech tickets through ChatGPT just for our own interest. I would say for the majority of our tickets, it gives the answer that we would give to the customer. Sometimes it even explained better.


In theroy it could replace our tier 1 service, and most likely eliminate us getting 75+% of our tickets."
"Just to be clear ChatGPT isn't connected to our ticketing system, we are manually feeling the tickets into Chat GPT.


For our ticketing system we us Service Now's ITSM.


If you are asking becuase you are looking for a ticketing solution, my favorite ticketing solution is either Zendesk or Freshdesk. Both are far cheaper and have a lot of great features."
"So if you have enterprise chat gpt you can connect it via the api.


We’re doing that right now for our internal ticketing t1. The plan is to create a “suggested response” with it."
That's something you could've done without Chat GPT.
"Chat gpt provides great answers and write ups, we find it’s accurate 95% of the time for tier 1 questions. That’s why it’s a suggested answer, a user has to check it to make sure it’s not that 5%. At least for customer facing service requests.


For internal IT we just have it run the show"
Also we find users prefer chat gpt to the human chat. It scores higher in being able to give empathetic responses
"I work for a small business on a team of three people. We've already started laughing about how we will absolutely be replaced by AI. Like.. maybe not our boss specifically but I could see him just not replacing us as we leave for automated AI. At the very least he could go down to one office staff that could cover the parts and AI can't cover.


We started using ChatGPT for email replies to difficult clients. It's real handy when you're trying to figure out how to not ask someone if they're an idiot. It does a very good job.


Edit, I work as a service provider. Effectively a sales person but.. you either need our service or you don't. Figured I'd include that since it often feels like most people on this sub are IT type people"
"75% is a tad strong with GPT3.5/4, but I can see some CEO's doing it, regretting it immensely, then stepping it back after they realize they still need people to carry out these tasks 50-80% of the time.


ChatGPT is just to 2023 what Google was to 1998. Jobs will be lost over it just like back then. The difference here is, ChatGPT 5/6 and up, and its competitors. Will progress stall, or will we see the same gains we saw from traditional keyword search -> ChatGPT? If it's the latter, it's scary."
"there is no serious push to slow down the development of AI. there was one circulated a while back, but it was very divisive at best, and poorly reasoned (naively idealized without roots in reality - you'd never get ""bad actors"" like china, russia, iran etc - even US - to stop).


the AIs we have now such as chatGPT and the like are socalled narrow LLMs that excel at one task, and one task only - outputing text given an input of text. they dont think or understand anything, they simply process an input text against their 50+ terabytes of curated training data. they're basically a hugely expensive and sophisticated auto-complete. the clippy of machine learning if you will. this makes them good at mimicing text, and returning a response that is statistically probably coherent. but it doesn't know the difference. just that ""with input like this, in X% of cases an answer should  look like this"", which means it'll produce answers that often are wrong with 100% confidence.


what people are afraid of is what's called AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, an AI thats not narrow in scope like LLMs are, but one that has a wide scope. one that allows it to do many tasks and train on many types of data and accumulate new data and adapt.


don't get me wrong, im very excited too. but currently its not really useable for things that require an understanding. its good at superficial things like formatting, condensing or extracting text. no need to be worried just yet."
"The rest of big tech are not ready to compete; they want to hamper the competition before they lose more market share. That and ChatGPT 3.5/4 are already “enough” to displace a LOT of people, but what’s most concerning is not their current potential but future potential. How quickly will ChatGPT 5/6 advance?


I never thought that Google would be replaced despite it being more common in tech. If google can’t compete in the next few years, a decade later they may not be what they once were."
"AI such as ChatGPT and others will probably eliminate 9 out of 10 jobs and since everyone will be using it, nobody will want to risk profits going back to slower meat suits. It will be absolute armageddon for all desk workers eventually. And those prompt engineers? Well with millions of applicants to choose from it will quickly become a minimum wage job, probably outsourced even for maximum profit margins."
"Highly unlikely. Chatgpt is not revolutionary in the same capacity as the internet or computers yet. Perhaps eventually but no where close now.


It can not replace trades at all atm. It can not do research into fields where there is no knowledge. It can not solve the issue of nursing. It can't replace physical human interactions.


There are million of job right now that could be automated 20 Years ago but isn't because people want the human interactions that comes with it.


Yes a robot could 100% dispense medicine far better and more accurately then any human but people like the person there. They want to be able to express there fears and doubts to nurses and have them comfort them during difficult times. Cold emotionless robots with nothing but logic is not enough for alot of people. They want to feel like the other person truely cares and chatgpt does not provide.


If anything people need to begin considering going into fields where there is both a need for hard skills and soft skills. Nursing will always be in demand. Therapist as well. Scientists to push the boundaries of science. Engineers to build things."
"I am not talking about trades or jobs that require a physical presence. Digital artists, accountants, auditors, programmers, customer service call centers, R&D, Wall Street, etc. anyone who works behind a desk and relies on computers to do their jobs are slated for extinction.


For example my sister works in financial compliance. Her department has 6 people. Everyone works 80 hour weeks every end of quarter and tax time for weeks on end. ChatGPT will make it require 1, the lead accountant who signs off on the paperwork, and those quarterly reports will be done in minutes and everyone else will be given the boot. The productivity gains of 1 person with AI will eliminate multiple jobs.


And the corporations won’t save us because it will absolutely become an arms race for AI capabilities, race to bottom in costs and race to the stratosphere in profits. At some inflection point companies will end up out of business **not** going hard and fast on AI rollout and shedding the unnecessary humans."
">It’s like putting your employees on Aderall- the goal is to give productive employees GPT as a tool and allow them to produce 20 hours of work in an 8 hours span


And this is what kills it for me. You hear about people who have been ahead of the curve taking advantage of chat GPT to do their work in 1/4 of the time and then take on 3 full time jobs at once for some hefty income. But employers are going to catch on and this will become the norm. Eventually workers won't get any benefit. We'll be expected to be at least 3x as productive as we used to be all while still working 8+ hour days, 40+ hour weeks, for the same salary we had before. The real winners will be the ones at the top as always."
"Sure, higher productivity may be the goal but giving people a raise? He might be a unicorn ceo who does that but the historical data shows that the money made by the massive productivity gains made in the past few years went straight into the pockets of the already rich. Barring any serious legislation (never happen with this congress), there’s zero reason to think that this will change.


Edit: the following passage gives an insight into the ceo’s ultimate goals: “Nigam believes that everybody at his company must be committed to using ChatGPT for the company to reap the benefits of reduced workloads and headcount. “


Reduced headcount.   Says it all."
"Yes, but ChatGPT can write out the easily searchable answer in a friendly manor that won't piss off your customers. Where your typical Level 1 tech support can easily piss off your customers. It has really good ""bedside manor""."
"This use case is exactly where I see ChatGPT taking jobs. Just translating between grandma and google in a friendly way. It’s not actually that smart, but its power is in understanding/generating language. That alone can cover a huge % of people’s technical problems."
"Keyword search is inferior to prompting ChatGPT. It's also more of a skill than you imply, but yes most people could find general answers to their problems very simply."
"Depends on the company. If u work with alot of custom software then it is useless. How will chatgpt know how to move an option in proprietory software #4000.


Also people are dumb. Very dumb. Sometimes, having a list of instructions is not enough. U need to read them out to them 1 by 1 for them to do it.


If I had a dollar for every ticket I had that the answer could be found by googling I would own maybe 1 whole share of Google."
"Fr man. My case wasn't technical per se but I tried doing a 30 years, yearly increase of rent for commercial properties based on a set percentage per year and ChatGPT kept putting wrong values. So frustrating when I realized after the 5th property."
"???


Were you trying to get chatgpt to do math?"
"Yes like ""x is the yearly rent, what is the the yearly rent for 30 years with y increase per year"" and ChatGPT would build a table with the wrong figures."
"Does it understand English? There is a very good video from Kyle Hill on YT about this fact.


As a tldr alpha go beat the world go champ a few years back. This guy was the Bobby fisher or Gary kasperove of Go. Anything less then winning a tournament is a disappointing showing. He was absolutely dominate at Go. And he lost to alpha go 4-1.


When chatgpt was blowing up there was a minor news article of a amertur beating the same bot that beat the champ at go Consistently. He used a unique trick that would never work in a game against humans because in go, we understand what groups of stones are, the bot did not and lost because of it.


It is a fantastic video I would recommend u watch it. I am woefully under representing what the video explains."
"> ""I don't know, here is some gibberish, good luck. ""


does autism cause vaccines?






ChatGPT - ""No, autism does not cause vaccines. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism. This claim was based on a study that has been thoroughly discredited and retracted from the scientific literature. Numerous studies since then have found no link between vaccines and autism."""
"> So frustrating when I realized after the 5th property.


That's because you failed at the n°1 rule of using ChatGPT for work: only ask it to do something for you that's faster than you doing it, but that you can actually verify quickly."
"ChatGPT4 is pretty damn scary at how often it’s right.


We put a bunch of interview questions in and it pretty much nailed them all.


Of course when it does a screw up, it is VERY confidently incorrect.


It’s not going to replace most workers - it just makes them much more efficient by automatic the tedious tasks.  Which is great for many white collar jobs where the goal is just to get things done fast.


The problem is going to be in schools - where the goal is to LEARN.  If you know how to solve a problem you can let it do it faster then check its work, and it’s a net gain.  If you never learned how to solve the problem you can’t really check it’s work, and it will take a lot longer trying to figure out where it might have fucked up."
Nope. ChatGPT is actually doing fairly well for being less than a year old.
"I don't feed ChatGPT code directly, the infosec guys would send me to the shadow realm for that.




But even still, it's quite useful. I usually just explain the problem and ask how would it solve that, and it gave me many ideas I never thought about."
They recently announced Incognito mode to address this issue so companies can use ChatGPT without data collection. So it sounds like the public will be the ginny pig to train on while employees will be the beneficiaries of privacy.
I should have had chatGPT take over my spell checking ahaha.
I mean if you are dumb enough to put sensitive information into chatGPT then yeah you probably have a life lesson coming your way.
"I'm fairly certain Google and Microsoft don't explicitly state that they will use your documents stored on/created by their services for their own purposes (assuming that they do at all, since it'd be a massive risk if they were doing it behind everyone's back).  OpenAI does.  They're very up-front about the fact that nothing you say to ChatGPT is in confidence, and in fact it will be used for further training of their models."
"You can disable that on ChatGPT, but the crux of the issue is trusting some faceless multibillion dollar company."
"Might be correct for chatgpt ( although it was changed If i remember correctly)


But as a Corporation i would expect gpt4 to be used through the Azure OpenAI service. And there that is definitely Not the case"
I mean... Guthub has access to the complete code of entire procets so how exaclty does writting error messages in chatGPT changes anything?
"> Guthub


Better check the belly of the beast... /s


Github has code access but isn't connecting that to all sorts of other telemetry data about the company, it doesn't have data on users beyond code or like personal data, location, etc etc. It just has code in there and some metadata about languages/platforms/common patterns etc.


ChatGPT is trying to connect far beyond any other targeted AI dataset, It think targeted sets are better for privacy and keeping too much telemetry from leaking.


AI companies are also excessively pumping in data because regulation is coming and they want to have the largest datasets before that happens to block out other players that may be more ethical."
"It will be a while till chatgpt retrains models on that data, and you can find  2 year old snippets of code of most any companies out there."
"Same.  They had an issue with leaking users' payment info a month or two ago.   Also, ChatGPT has gotten so big and is collecting so much info I'm sure they're a big target for malicious hackers."
You can pay for privatized instances of ChatGPT. It's not the same as just typing it into `chat.openai.com` or where ever
"There are also locally hosted options that approach the effectiveness of ChatGPT. [This GLM](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B/blob/main/README_en.md) for example was specifically trained to be able to be processed on a single consumer grade GPU


There aren't any quite as refined as GPT 4 but they're making strides roughly as quickly as these larger models are. I expect this to be the future of GLMs, especially if one of the big players gets caught inappropriately using customer data in the near future"
"What trade secrets? It will be a while till that data is filtered, processed, and a new model trained on it.


Most companies have nothing that will be unique if publicized few years after. If it has then chatgpt is unlikely help to start with, since it would be really cutting edge, or really outside of the norm at least for it to give meaningful feedback."
My company allowed the use of ChatGPT but has “advised” people not to sensitive stuff on there. How will they know if employees do? They can’t.
"OpenAI has problem with GDPR. Like other online business, they are collecting our data. But there's a solution if you want to use ChatGPT without any privacy breaches. Use it thru Utopia anonymous messenger."
"I know lol. I had a case at work a few week ago of a person putting in a large amount of private data and telling them how to do something with it. Mind you this is confidential information. It is audited as well so it has to be kept secret and confidential and some dude is slapping it into chatgpt and saying I want to do this with it.


He had a stern talking to...not by me but the CTO 😆"
"Idk… they’re really good at filtering out sensitive data when ChatGPT outputs code. It usually replaces api keys, for instance, with a generic [API KEY] tag."
I mean…. You could ask chatgpt.
">If it saves hiring one more developer, it already pays off by a lot.


I'm not saying you're wrong but the cost to using ChatGPT isn't just the $2K fee, it's also the time it takes to train employees to use the system. Not just to use it but use it properly with respect to data security. Does ChatGPT store what users feed it? They say no if you use the API...that means you have to educate your users on how the API differs from the web interface. Otherwise, you may have a mess to cleanup when someone accidentally feeds your proprietary data into ChatGPT web interface."
"There's one visible switch in the ChatGPT web interface that needs to be set to ""off"".


I think you're grasping at straws here."
"What straws? That you have to train people before you give them access to a new tool? I mean we've seen examples of Samsung employees leaking sensitive data to ChatGPT. If they were unaware of the switch you mention, that's part of training. If the switch did not exist in the version of ChatGPT that they used, it's also part of training. I don't get what's so hard to understand here.


The cost to use a new tool is not just the licensing cost of that tool. That's the reality from my experience as a software engineer. Perhaps that's not your experience but I don't think it's hard to grasp that you have to educate people around the usage of tools like ChatGPT."
Aren’t school kids using chatgpt? It definitely saves more time than training takes anyway.
"Lmao your reading comprehension is what’s bad. My point was, if chatgpt is easy enough for school kids to use, “training” adult employees shouldn’t be all that difficult."
"I have already addressed this in other comments. It's not just about using ChatGPT, it's how to use it so you don't even up like the Samsung employees. Or like the US military when their soldiers started strapping fitness devices to their wrists and uploading their movement + GPS to Strava. Were the soldiers morons? No. But the military had to ""teach"" them how innocuous things can leak information to outsiders. The cost of those fitness devices was trivial. But having Strava collecting detailed, near real-time data on US troop movement and secret base locations was priceless! The bigger your organization, the more it costs to roll out new tools. Even simple ones.

"Yeah. API or not I would never post anything I would not post to an open forum like stackoverflow, and I would expect my team to do the same.


But I have had great success in fixing bad code during code reviews from asking ChatGPT3 about a more efficient way of doing X in a framework I have barely used."
">Yeah. API or not I would never post anything I would not post to an open forum like stackoverflow, and I would expect my team to do the same.


You can't just expect, you have to educate your team. Depending on the size of your team, that's an additional cost.


&#x200B;


>But I have had great success in fixing bad code during code reviews from asking ChatGPT3 about a more efficient way of doing X in a framework I have barely used.


Again, I am not saying there's no place for it. It's a tool and as a software engineer, more tools is better than fewer tools."
Yeah...that's why I didn't disagree with you in my initial comment. I just said the cost of using ChatGPT is more than the licensing cost.
">It's like talking to a human.


Do you know how much time (i.e. money) companies spend training their employees to NOT talk to the WRONG humans? The weakest link in IT security is humans. I'm glad you said it's like talking to a human because that's precisely how the worst data exploits happen. And this is even worse because you won't easily know that Bobby in HR has been putting company data in ChatGPT until that data leaks to other users of ChatGPT."
"It's $20 each.


>  Akash Nigam, [...] — is spending $2,400 a month on ChatGPT Plus accounts for all of his 120 employees as part of an experiment to boost productivity and save money."
"Let me save everyone a click:


>Akash Nigam, the founder of Genies — the $1 billion avatar startup used by celebrities like Justin Bieber and Cardi B — is spending $2,400 a month on ChatGPT Plus accounts
for all of his 120 employees as part of an experiment to boost
productivity and save money. Insider verified the purchase of the
accounts with a receipt.


So basically it's a company that's floating around trying to suck up venture capital money until it either goes bust or gets bought out for more than it's worth.  It's not a real company."
"Basically every SaaS vendor is announcing a ChatGPT or similar AI integration. It’s been happening for months.


But tbh it’s mostly for fundraising rather than anything"
Bc it is a company embracing chatgpt rather than banning it out of fear
ChatGPT has been tremendous at teaching me PowerShell scripting. I think CGPT along with other online resources is an insane combo for learning code at least.
"Yup. Now there are times when it just spits out straight-up bad results, but thats why you use other resources. For Powershell, the Microsoft doc, stackoverflow, chatGPT and a few random sites I found help me write a CLI for my backup system. I didn't know shit about Powershell just a few weeks ago.


I'm planning to learn Python myself. Can't wait."
I have bought a ChatGPT license for every developer. They use the same rules regarding IP and code security as they did before. If you wouldn't post it on Stack Overflow don't paste it in ChatGPT. It's not complicated.
"On chatgpt settings:
https://imgur.com/a/bGHc5h7"
That's why they are using chatgpt. You can just tell it to don't feed the data.
"This is all ChatGPT-- both the API and the web interface... not sure what you mean.


Edit: If you mean turning off the settings in the web interface, you aren't able to save chats for future reference. There's a cost to disabling that setting."
I just told you they are not using the API because you can decide to not feed the AI with your data on chatgpt. You don't have to use API to not use your data to improve the AI.
The API is not the same as ChatGPT and often requires extensive tuning to get good results. Either way ChatGPT really only handles code snippets and it’s very useful for boring work that no one is going to steal.
"You can use the ChatGPT 3/4 models via the API and doesn't require the tuning. The davinci models required tuning


The ChatGPT models in the api: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4)


Tuning's not available for 3.5-turbo and 4: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/is-fine-tuning-available-for-gpt-3-5-turbo"
Who is feeding sensitive information to chatgpt?
"So if I'm using chatgpt in my work I'm feeding it with sensitive information?
Do you think that no one that works can use Google because you think you will query sensitive information if you google something?"
"If you are inputting sensitive data into ChatGPT, or Google, or any electronic third party, you should assume that the information is no longer secured to your company alone. We've learned this through multiple lawsuits.


Doesn't guarantee that it will be stolen or abused, but we know that it's easily collected, even when companies say they're 'not storing it'."
"true. So I still ask you. Who is feeding sensitive information to chatgpt?
Using chatgpt at work does not mean you are inputting sensitive data into it."
">He even plans on making ChatGPT usage a part of his employees' performance reviews next year. Part of the reviews, he said, will look at how his employees use tools like ChatGPT to ""effectively accelerate"" their departments.






The employees that are ""using AI effectively"" will be up for a promotion and raise, he said. The ones who aren't will fall behind.


These guys just can't help themselves. They must be douchebags.


>While it has only been a month since Genies' employees have had their accounts, Nigam said he has ""already seen many tasks get accelerated.""


Also, he's probably lying."
"I’m a developer, and I use ChatGPT about every day.


He’s absolutely lying. It sucks pretty bad at programming. It can give you the general structure, but it struggles with anything serious.


It’s basically only good for skipping some simple googles. If I need a simple command, or a quick way to do something, it’ll give it to me a lot faster than google


It is wrong a lot though, and you have to spend time validating what it tells you in a lot of cases since it’ll lie. It’s definitely sent me down the wrong path before and wasted a couple hours


It’s at most a 15% efficiency bump to an engineer"
"I'm not entirely sure how ChatGPT even helps for development. The best I can figure is simple tasks but the only ones I can think of take just as long to conceive a prompt for than to just do it.


My thinking has been that it could probably replace an brand new (incompetent), unskilled code monkey. The sort of junior dev that needs handholding through your codebase, that a senior dev has to review everything they output before it gets integrated into source control fully, etc.


The problem of course is that while that may sound like it would replace jobs, I'm not entirely convinced it would.


Because incompetent, unskilled code monkeys don't actually save time. They waste Senior developers time, and the same is true here, I think. The big difference is that while junior devs like that will usually learn and become more self-sufficient over time, ChatGPT never will.


So far what I've actually seen it output are basic examples. Like- ok cool, you can ask it to write you a fizzbuzz program. Awesome. And oh, neat, a fibonacci function. But like- that's basic stuff. I've not seen much real-world examples of it being used. Even some of the examples where it ""finds bugs"" are fragile. Change a few variable names, and it happily declares the same code bug-free.


My favourite example was actually on one of the Windows subreddits when ChatGPT was first taking off. Somebody asked it to create a script to delete temporary files. That batch script included this:


del /s C:\Windows\temp*


That is- it was broken.  They never tested it. That command deletes recursively all files starting with ""temp"" from the C:\Windows folder. it doesn't delete temporary files at all. But goodbye, TempSignedLicenseExchangeTask.dll, hope you weren't important.


And these are all examples without any added context. Adding something in real-world programs will require knowledge of the context and surrounding classes, and I'm skeptical you can pump in that code and get it to generate usable code utilizing it. This applies doubly if you happen to use class or variable names that are used elsewhere in it's data set."
"you're right. for example i asked chatGPT a simple question to create a regex to split up ID, name, code and quantity of a product from a string and it took it tinkering the question more than 20 times.


Sometimes it was not splitting up name and code from each other. or when it was telling me that this code gives this output, real output was just an error.


it could be the case that i was wrong, but i doubt."
">Also, he's probably lying.


I use it to write technical documentation and care and maintenance manuals for my products. It used to take me a an hour or two to write each one (even with copy/pasting the parts that are common in all the documents). Also, it's incredibly boring and creatively draining. I tried ChatGPT to see if it would make this easier and faster. Now, that it's trained, I just input any changes or additions then proofread the result. Whole process takes maybe 5-10 minutes per document.


It took maybe an hour to train it the first time."
"I can tell you're a young person so I'll let this slide. If I thought you were an adult, I'll say that was a shortsighted way of thinking. Ability to use a single tool doesn't make one employee deserve a raise over another. ChatGPT is a tool; it's not a silver bullet.


But you're young (hopefully) and all of this will fly over your head.


>and not do anything new to add value


Even if you're a young person, you have to be able to formulate better argument than this. How do you get to ""not do anything new to add value"" from my comment? Once again, ChatGPT is a tool. When you get old enough, in life and in your career, you'll realize that bosses frequently get infatuated with a new tool. And like all infatuations, it passes."
"Bots have been able to play the games better then gamers since forever.  We don't need ChatGPT (or whatever the correct term for A.I. is- since it isn't true A.I.) to do this.


Take racing games as an example.


The last thing you want is bots that continuously run perfect turns on the track and optimal speeds.  The moment the player messes up they simply can't catch up.


Every racing game has some sort of 'rubber banding' built in.  You know how much fun it is to be racing head to head on the last lap?  THAT IS ENTIRELY INTENTIONAL.


FPS are the same way.  The last thing you want are bots with perfect aim.


-------------


A.I.'s and CHATGPT are the NFT's of this year.


I mean, it isn't entirely accurate.  The useage case for NFT's is pretty low.  CHATGPT and the underlying A.I. (godddamit it pains me to call it that) has a legitimate use.


But NFT's last year were crammed into everything because VIP's thought people wanted it.  That is going on here."
Until ChatGPT includes data security it will just be a fun tool to use. We’ve already seen what using this in your company can lead to a la Samsung!
"ChatGPT is a trillion dollar lawsuit in the making. If any data landed on the servers that is considered covered under regulation frameworks (GDPR, California Privacy Act etc), the company owning that data need to provide privacy guarantees which I’m unsure how will be achieved. You can also feed poison data to ChatGPT like someone else’s SSN, driver license, etc.


As always pros and cons."
"The plus is like $20/mo so that’s 100 employees. ChatGPT has helped me a lot by converting code I understand to languages I don’t. For example, I know how to do some things in Bash, but I needed to do an analogous function in python (which I’m not yet very fluent in) for a program I’m using. ChatGPT gave me a functional code which likely did save me hours of my time. If ChatGPT saves each worker just 1hr/mo it’s definitely worth it.


Edited for incorrect scalar."
"Why? you can get unlimited access to a more powerful ChatGPT on Utopia anonymous messenger. No personal data collection, you can access it anonymously."
I honestly… end up SPENDING hours trying to get Chatgpt to produce something useable.
"I'm not surprised but not sure why just ChatGPT...there are new startups that are specific for CEOs, founders and team leads that aren't just a generic assistant.




Tabi is an example (DTC founders & team leads). It helps them save time. You can ask anything related to sales, marketing, metrics, company financials/accounting, etc.

"I mean if people are directly copy pasting from Chatgpt, they are just asking to be caught"
"It's the same as copying from Wikipedia, but people seem to think they're more likely to get away with it for some reason. It's not just directly copy-pasting, it's paraphrasing, too, because half the stuff ChatGPT comes out with is taken off the internet/other sources, and the other half is sh\*t it makes up, all presented in a nonsensical word salad."
"So just a quick question, what if its your own words and thoughts, but you use Chatgpt to structure and rephrase the sentence better, do you tend to easily catch on that too?"
"Yup.


If someone submits an essay, written in their own words, you pick up very easily on their writing style. Maybe they use first person a lot, maybe they're very formal, maybe they list, there's always something, or, usually, several somethings, that identify it as their writing. If they then suddenly submit an essay with a completely different writing style, you notice.


Particularly if it's ChatGPT's writing style, which tends to be overly verbose and unnecessarily complicated in every essay it writes, which is easier to spot when 10 students hand in essays all written that exact same way."
"If you're already stupid or lazy enough to use ChatGPT to write your essays, surely *if* it was enough to fool a plagiarism checker to simply enter grammar mistakes (which it probably wouldn't be?) then losing a few marks for that would be better than getting suspended for being a plagiariser?"
"You'd have to do a whole lot more than find/replacing a few things. I'm a Cybersecurity PhD - and the bare, bare, bare bones to get away with this would involve copying the words into notepad, formatting it all to be normal to remove any GPT watermarks. Completely redo periods, comas, and repeated rephrases. Insert errors, remove redundancies.... then put it into word, writing it, so that word records it as YOU writing it... and at this point....


YOU'RE DOING MORE WORK THAN JUST SYNTHESIZING AND WRITING YOUR OWN THOUGHTS!!!!! It's not worth the trouble, and you're wasting you're time on something less productive educationally. Use ChatGPT like wikipedia, its good to brainstorm - then go and find sources, and use your own words. And just be concise. No one grading wants to read long winded papers. We love concise. Concise is good."
I'm overly verbose and unnecessarily complicated in everything I write. It's a bloody good job that I graduated before ChatGPT was a thing
"It doesn’t make sense to me why rephrasing through Chatgpt still constitute as academic misconduct. If you have done the necessary research, referenced as required and drawn your own judgements based on the research but merely use Chatgpt to rephrase your sentences in a better structure or standard, how does that still count as plagiarism?"
"Because ChatGPT bases how it rephrases things off existing texts, resulting in the plagiarism software picking it up, and it rephrases things with a certain lexis that it uses on everything.


Something like word spell check or Grammarly, for comparison, is just a straightforward SPAG check, and only offers suggestions based on standard grammar, rather than pulling from the internet."
"You don't think grammarly uses a pseudo-language corpus in the same way that ChatGPT uses a pseudo-language corpus?


Do you also consider Word's spelling checker to be unfair?"
"Grammarly checks what you have already written and attempts to correct basic mistakes without changing too much. If you used grammarly to change your writing so much that it looked different to your usual submissions they would check it in a plagiarism detector.
ChatGPT *gives* you writing to pass as your own."
"That’s different. It is performing a simple operation of spell checking/ grammar checking, something that in most institutions above high school level, (such as universities) you don’t even get marked on anyway.


If your spelling and grammar is horrible, at absolute best grammarly has probably moved around a couple punctuation points and replaced a couple words so maybe the work is 99.9% yours and 0.1% modified by a tool (with what was being changed not actively changing the content, meaning or flow).


Vs if you either ask chatgpt to write it for you then reword it, or if you ask chatgpt to rewrite/improve/restructure your first draft; the percentage of your original work to AI is much lower + it is actively changing and adding to the actual content of the paper.


TL;DR - grammarly doesn’t change the content and realistically the changes it makes are small and don’t actively change its meaning nor does it have the ability to make large scale changes to the structure (outside of adding/removing punctuation/small word replaces for tense checking etc.) vs chatgpt actively makes large scale changes not just to the structure of your report with very little input from the user but also can generate sections of the report for you."
"To add to my last comment, for fun I thought I’d ask chatgpt for “unbias explanation of ethics of using chatgpt for proof reading an essay vs grammarly”.


This is what chatgpt’s ‘opinion’ was:


“Using ChatGPT as a proofreader can raise ethical considerations similar to using AI tools like Grammarly. However, there are some important differences to keep in mind.


ChatGPT, as an AI language model, can provide feedback and suggestions beyond just spelling and grammar. It can help with sentence structure, coherence, clarity, and even provide ideas or insights for improvement. While Grammarly is primarily designed to focus on specific language errors, ChatGPT can offer a more comprehensive analysis of your essay.


However, it's crucial to be mindful of the boundaries between using ChatGPT as a proofreader and using it to generate or significantly alter the content of your paper. If you rely too heavily on ChatGPT to create or modify the substance of your essay without proper attribution or acknowledgment, it may cross into unethical territory, potentially involving issues like plagiarism or academic dishonesty.”"
"Thing is, Word tells you to consider revising a wordy sentence. It doesn’t re-write it for you. Putting a whole essay through ChatGPT and asking to correct spelling and grammar mistakes without changing sentence structure would not be plagiarism. I’ve read dissertations for friends to find spelling errors. That’s not cheating."
My writting style for essays is naturally ChatGPT the fact that I have such a long history of writting essays in that style is the only reason I'm ok cause I can pull out the 95% written by chat gpt essay written 10 years before chat gpt even came out.
"Then your writing will be unnecessarily complicated and overly verbose in a different way. ChatGPT and tools like it all do the same thing in the same way, while humans do it much differently.


As an example if the assignment question was, and this is like a very basic version for demonstrative purposes: is water wet? Explain how you know.


An overly verbose student might say something like 'Water is wet because it is a liquid, and liquids are wet. Liquids are one of the three states of matter, the other two being solid and gas, and a key marker of liquid is that it is wet, and if you were to touch it, it would be wet. L Frank Baum said, of water, 'how very wet this water is', and he was correct in doing so. Therefore, water is wet, and I know that to be true because it is a liquid.'


This is overly verbose word salad. They could make the exact point they're trying to make in a single sentence. There is no need to explain to this degree. But I've worked with this student for a while now, and I know that this is how they answer every single question, and the response itself is standard for them, as well as any other text markers they use. As an example, I am guilty of overusing 'therefore', and therefore appears in every essay I write, multiple times, the same way it did in this answer. I did not consciously choose to do that, it just came out like that while I was typing.


And I just put that exact prompt into ChatGPT and this is what it gave me:


'The question of whether water is wet is a topic of some debate, as it depends on how one defines the term ""wet.""


One definition of ""wet"" is that it refers to a state in which a substance is covered or saturated with water or another liquid. In this sense, water cannot be wet, because water is the liquid that wets other things, rather than being wet itself.


However, another definition of ""wet"" is that it refers to the ability of a substance to cause another substance to become covered or saturated with water or another liquid. In this sense, water can be considered wet, because it has the ability to wet other substances.


Ultimately, the answer to the question of whether water is wet depends on how one chooses to define the term ""wet."" However, based on the common understanding of the word, water is not typically considered to be wet, as it is the liquid that wets other things rather than being wet itself.'


ChatGPT's answer is significantly worse, because it does the same overexplaining that the first answer does, but times by ten. It also gets overly technical about the question of what constitutes wet, in a way I did not ask for it to do. The bot also makes one single point this whole time, and then just restates the same point over and over, as well as the repeated use of several words in the same sentence, and the... well, robotic... impersonal way it writes. This example has not been written from prior knowledge of the author, this example has been written by pooling a few resources on water.


Additionally, I just put both examples into an AI detector (copyleaks), and while I am taking it with a pinch of salt because I know AI detectors aren't infallible, it correctly assessed that the first example was human made text, and the second had a 99.9% chance of being AI.


I also, just for good measure, asked ChatGPT to regenerate the text, and got this:


'The question of whether water is wet is a topic of debate and depends on one's definition of ""wet.""


One definition of ""wet"" is that it refers to an object that is covered or saturated with a liquid substance. By this definition, water itself is not wet because it is a liquid substance that cannot be covered or saturated with itself. However, if we consider an object that is in contact with water, such as a surface that has been submerged or sprayed with water, we could say that the object is wet because it is covered or saturated with water.


Another definition of ""wet"" is that it refers to the sensation or feeling of moisture or dampness. By this definition, water can be considered wet because when we touch water, we can feel its wetness.


In conclusion, whether water is considered wet or not depends on the definition of ""wet"" being used. If we define ""wet"" as an object covered or saturated with a liquid substance, then water itself is not wet. However, if we define ""wet"" as the sensation or feeling of moisture or dampness, then water can be considered wet.'


This is the exact same answer as above, with slightly different phrasing, but the exact same tone, identical lexis, the same lack of actual information, and this one also got 99.9% in the AI detector. Now, imagine I have a class of 30 students, who all get the same prompt, and of those 30, let's say 10 use ChatGPT, and then I get 10 essays that all restate these same points with the same tone. Really not hard to pick out at that point."
You can literally make chat gpt write in your writing style
"That’s the grey area that universities are currently developing policies for. Is asking ChatGPT to restructure a sentence any different to, say, Grammarly (a tool whose use is actively used encouraged) also doing it for you?"
"The best way I can explain it is that Grammarly is a SPAG checker, first and foremost, and it just happens to use some AI features, while ChatGPT is just straight up AI and any SPAG help it offers is incidental.


Or, another way to phrase it, Grammarly has never set off a plagiarism checker, while ChatGPT not only has, but the text it generates is easily identifiable."
"I’m not sure you can say with 100% confidence that a sentence rephrased with ChatGPT has set off a plagiarism detector. Not least because there’s a strong chance that you’d get the exact same suggestion from Grammarly.


The fact they’re two different tools with two different ways of working is irrelevant if the final sentence is the same."
"I think the difference is that grammarly makes suggestions for sentence structure changes, but ultimately it's up to you to make those changes.
Whereas ChatGPT can be used to make the changes and create academic text without your input."
"Not if you ask ChatGPT “can you rephrase this to be more grammatically correct: <sentence>”, or such like.


That’s the point I’m making. Universities are currently developing policies to support that kind of use."
"I agree, ChatGPT should be used as a helping tool, not as a way to write your whole essay. I’ve used ChatGPT to help me with my essays to an extent but not to the point of copy-pasting or paraphrasing"
"This is the way to do it. I think there are other tools that serve the same purpose, but if you are using ChatGPT, just limit it to your planning. Don't let it get into the stuff you submit."
"I use ChatGPT to plan my study schedules and study plans and also form me study revision tables as well, great tool but shouldn’t be used to write essays…. People need to have original ideas these days 🤦🏽‍♀️"
"just ask chatgpt to help you make a revision time table and it’s going to need how many topics you need, exam dates, how many hours per day and it’s going to personalize a timetable for you :)"
"I honestly don't know how someone *could* get chatGPT to write their essay, read the output, and think ""yeah, I'm happy calling this dumpster fire my own."" Not once has ChatGPT given me something that I haven't then had to cut apart and completely rewrite."
I use chatGPT as a final spelling and grammar checker.
"I completely agree! I struggle with understanding how to structure a particular essay sometimes, so putting the prompt into chatgpt to get an idea of what framework to use has been really beneficial. No copying actual text, no plagiarism, just inspiring my paragraph structure and some ideas for research."
"Maybe wouldn't go this far in saying we spot things every time, but a few general bits of info...


* If you're caught plagiarising early on in your degree (say in 1st year), you likely won't get the most serious of penalties, but the bigger issue is you'll probably be flagged as having plagiarised, so future things you submit will be looked at considerably more closely.
* Almost all degree programmes are designed to be accumulative in nature - you're not just writing an essay for the sake of it, you're writing it to develop certain skills and reinforce your understanding of certain bits of information, which will be assumed for later assignments and so on... in most cases, even if you're not actually caught, what you would gain from cheating on a bit of coursework is less than you'd lose later on for not understanding what you're doing. \[you could always say ""oh I'll just cram it later"", but I'm pretty sure nobody who says this, myself included, has ever actually done this...\]
* Large language models, fundamentally, can only work with things they've already seen. In a lot of cases, if someone's caught copying something from ChatGPT, it's not specifically for that - it's for copying something from ChatGPT which has lifted some material from another source.
* People who mark your work usually see dozens of submissions in a single session, and potentially many more if they've marked that work for a number of years. And almost always, people tend to make the same sort of mistakes. Noticing that something seems ""off"" isn't terribly hard with that experience, even if you're not sure *why* it's off, and then you can investigate things further and usually get a pretty good idea."
"This is spot on. At my uni, if we catch plagiarism the first thing we do is check the school to see if the person has done it before. If you do that in your first essay, you now have loads of assignments where you're marked as having plagiarised.


I also agree that the assignments we give early on are practice for when the grades really matter. I always get students panicking when the grades count and they spent the previous years not attending classes/taking time on their assignments.


I've marked literally thousands of essays. I always put the essay through ChatGPT to see what it looks like. I think, most of all, ChatGPT is terrible at engaging with the literature - the thing I'm assessing. If someone missed everything I've said to focus on, there's a serious issue."
"I can honestly understand secondary school kids trying to do this; you aren’t there by choice and it’s programmed into the teenage brain to make questionable decisions.


But UNIVERSITY students is honestly insane.
You’re there by choice, you should be taking immense pride in your work and striving to authentically improve it.


Chat GPT can be a fantastic tool to help you in your studies. It can explain concepts to you that maybe you’re struggling to understand, it can inspire ideas, you can genuinely use it as a helpful tool to AID you. Not do the work FOR you."
If you get caught using ChatGPT then you arent using it properly imo
Lecturers are panicking because chat gpt can actually teach students how to do things. And it can do it completely for free.
"If you're using ChatGPT in your final essay that you submit for grading, you aren't using it properly."
"I asked chatGPT to write an essay that I'm gonna write soon to see what it would do. The essay obviously lacked references and was incorrect sometimes but honestly looked better than half my essays. Seriously, it made me re think using it for structure and research"
"Structure, yes - although it will be pretty generic and uninspired. Research - do not trust a thing that ChatGPT tells you. It’s a predictive language model, so when you ask it for sources or data, it makes stuff up that’s likely to be true. Now, if you tell it some well-known theories or books to use, and ask it to summarise those in a framework, it can manage that."
So is it fine to use it to get ideas and then I develop throes ideas and write them in my own words in my essays? (IB now also requires citing Chatgpt if used for this purpose…)
Absolutely it is. ChatGPT is great for getting you started
"In all seriousness, Academic misconduct is not something people want and I don’t think it’s clicked with people that maybe you can just write your essay instead of asking something which cannot think for itself and just strings together text in a specific manner to make it sound cohesive to put something together. Uni graders oftentimes know what their talking about and I know people will complain about this comment, but ChatGPT just tries to use its data to infer what’s going on, and oftentimes it gets it plain wrong, which is incredibly easy to spot, especially for Uni level. Just write your essay or reports, and do the research. You learn more actually putting in the work and it’s much easier to do revision for an exam where you sit in a hall for 3 hours without technology when you actually learn the material beforehand."
"This actually happened a few months back to a guy on my course. Firstly, the result he got was shit (because ChatGPT original doesn't actually answer the questions that well) so he only got 30. Then he had an academic misconduct meeting where they accused him of plagiarism and halved his score (so now he got 15) and said if he does it again he's out."
The update is he got away with it completely… https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10es9s1/what_happened_to_the_4000_word_ai_written_essay/j5l17qu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&utm_term=15&context=3
"I agree it’s a bad idea to use it but people do use ChatGPT and get away with it, especially if they use it sparingly throughout their work. You make it sound like you can detect it most of the time, but I don’t think that will persuade people as it just seems untrue."
"The majority of plagiarism checkers can autodetect ChatGPT, and I have seen them do this many, many times. Most institutions now also have separate software specifically for AI detection, due to the influx of people trying it."
"Until someone uploads examples of their previous work, and asks the API to output content in their style, I can assure you, no AI detector will be able to pick that up.


However, those using the default style and just using ChatGPT on the web, you can detect it.


I can assure you, some of those students that you've marked as thought ""not using ChatGPT"", really are using ChatGPT."
"Genuine question - how many examples of your previous work will you need for that though? A first year uni student is going to have a handful of essays from A Levels, and most A Level essays are extremely different from university ones because teachers at A Level tell you exactly what points you need to make. My A Level essays were so generic they were practically ChatGPT generated already."
"One of the institutions I worked for, just as an example, uses Turnitin. My essay on Turnitin got a 3% similarity score, and the highlighted sections were quotes from other authors. All of my essays have gotten scores of under 5% on this software, as have the essays of people I did my degrees with.


One of my students recently scored 72% on Turnitin, with an essay that did not read like any other essay they had submitted previously. They used ChatGPT and claimed they had changed some phrasing around. Multiple other students had scores above 50%, and all of them ultimately confessed to using ChatGPT or another AI to produce the text.


This is just one example, of many, and this isn't even with an AI detector specifically, it's with a basic plagiarism detecting software that pretty much every uni in the UK uses. Plagiarism checkers are not garbage by any stretch of the imagination."
"I believe one of my institutions uses Passed, which is specifically for AI, and, again, has had no issue picking up generated text.


72% overall on an essay the student admitted came straight out of ChatGPT with a few phrases changed before submission."
"It's one example of several tools used across multiple institutions, because a tool specifically for AI is not standard practice right now, only things like Turnitin are.


We can argue all day about what % is standard plagiarism and what is AI, but I'm telling you that a student got a plagiarism score of 72% and then admitted they pulled the essay off of ChatGPT and rephrased some parts of it. I'm sure there was an issue, as clearly the 72% should have been a lot higher.


The bottom line is what I've been saying all along: we know you didn't write your essay and you're not clever for getting a machine to do it for you."
"It makes sense that students caught with high scores are the laziest and least competent with GPT. It does not follow however that those are the only students using it. You could be missing many if not most the students who use it for the essay writing process.


There is a science to prompting GPT, you can even give it an excerpt of your writing style to emulate, and ask it to properly reference every point in an essay (specifying not to hallucinate fake sources). Even OpenAI’s AI detection shows only a 26% successful detection rate for a reason.


Furthermore OpenAI’s recent joint report with Stanford/ Georgetown on mitigations for LLMs also made it clear there are severe limitations to AI detection. Even if Turnitin claims to circumvent this by building a personalised profile of your writing style, that’s only going to be relevant for a short window of time in a transitional phase as students adopt LLMs.


Hell in my last paper (MA at a top UK school) I had ChatGPT summarise my professor’s most recent policy paper knowing it had no access to it (post GPT-4’s 2021 dataset), and just from the title it summarised the article with uncanny similarity to the paper’s launch event summary, and its conclusion.


I then ran excerpts from my professor’s paper through the top 5 AI detection tools listed on Google and one of them showed 60%+ and others said to rewrite it to avoid detection."
"as others have pointed out, this doesn’t mean you’re catching _all_ students who use ChatGPT. what subject do you teach?"
"Turnitin is not a good example of a software to catch ChatGpt users, people got away with a lot of cheating when our uni used Turnitin.


Anything higher than 10% on turnitin was classed as a fail and plaguearism. With 7% being on the higher end. Most students get under 5% because some teachers even penalise above 5%. I changed my writing from UK to US standard on one essay and still got 84% pass so my previous style of writing did not matter.


University in the UK is based on the idea of reading past literature and understanding their work by explaining and expanding points. An AI can easily do this and a marker would be none the wiser if it was legit or not."
"Given that GPT-4 has a 32k word context limit, you can paste 2 of your previous essays in as context. Now chatGPT knows your writing style, and can emulate it decently.


In general, neural nets are great at fitting themselves to functions. If we can easily categorise blocks of text into “detectably ai generated” and “not”, and so can be made to consistently produce text that fits into the “not” category.


There’s no winning, we need to reform teaching in general."
"You're obviously a stupid educator if you think the problem is just an on off switch. Let me make this clear -


YOU 👏 CAN'T👏 STOP 👏 THE 👏 USE 👏 OF 👏 CHATGPT.


It has already changed the landscape of education, and people like yourself are just lagging behind at this point.


We should be training the next generation how to use these new tools to enhance their own learning, not pigeonholing them. For instance, whilst it might be stupid to have chatGPT to write an entire essay for you, using it to create a draft template for an assay may not be such a bad idea if you populate it yourself. Furthermore you can use chatGPT as a sounding board for content which you may want to include, along with inspiration. Or, you could even make a plan yourself with the main points you want to include in each paragraph and get chatGPT to do the heavy lifting. I've been using it recently by writing my own version of things, and asking chat GPT to make it more elegant and concise, and incorporating the parts of its suggestions that I like, whilst infusing it with my own style. Any one of these is perfectly acceptable in my opinion.


Furthermore, I think we should consider modifying our style of assessment i  response to the advent of language models. We know what chatGPT is going to become a large part of the education system moving forward, so instead of criminalising it, embrace it and make it work for you. For instance, if people are using it to write their essays and you suspect that they may not have an understanding of the actual content, consider adding in a verbal assessment where you question their knowledge of the content of the essay. Should be pretty simple to deduce if they have an actual understanding."
"I completely agree with you. Relying on AI tools like ChatGPT for essays is not only ethiclly dubious, but it also undermines the purpose of education itself. Students should be focused on learning, developing their critical thinking and writing skills, rather than trying to cut corners.Not only are educators adept at recognizing when a student's work has been generated by an AI, but as you mentioned, the consequences of attempting this form of plagiarism can be severe. The use of such tools might lead to serious academic penalties and ultimately, a loss of credibility and trust.Students should remember that the primary goal of education is self-improvement and knowledge acquisition. Instead of resorting to artificial means, it is worth investing time and effort into developing one's own writing capabilities, which will not only benefit academic life but also prove valuable in future professional endeavors. This was gpt-4's response to your post."
"This is an example of the toupee fallacy - the idea that you can always tell when someone is wearing a toupee because they look fake, but this doesn’t take into consideration the good toupees that have you fooled. You think you can detect all instances of chatGPT because you’ve found the badly done ones. It’s extremely likely there are cases that you haven’t caught."
"If you've got a bit of tech savyness (& know how to ask ChatGPT to write you a program in Python) - you can use the ChatGPT API to upload all your previous essays in .txt format.  You can then ask ChatGPT to write in your style, which will bypass most checks that uni's and markers will do."
"More time than using ChatGPT to generate code and uploading previous essays, and then checking sources to make sure it's not just made something up?"
"Often.. yes.


I demo'ed a proof of concept for a university a few weeks ago.  Took students essays, passed them through the API, and asked it to generate content using a few prompts, the staff could not tell all by 1 (we processed 10) were AI generated, and thats only because of a mistake in the one.


Start to finish, ChatGPT generated Python code to do the work in less than an hour, and it took a further 2 hours to craft the prompts\* to output the essays to ensure there was enough detailed content.


In all seriousness, AI is just going to get better, and it's going to be almost impossible to tell who wrote an essay in the next 2 years, even without any tech savyness.  So universities, well all educational establishments, are going to have to pivot.  Essays as assignments for university were so 2021... Instead of complaining that AI is submitting essays, do something different!


\* Prompts took in a series of sources, reference materials and quotes to build the essays around, ChatGPT picked them at random from the provided data, which ensured every essay was pretty unique.  Several of the essays even had completely different conclusions based on the source material and quotes that were randomly picked for them."
What useless degree are you doing that leads to a job that can be completely be done by chatGPT?
"How does this relate to my comment?


I don't think there are any jobs that can be done by ChatGPT, at the moment. But you could potentially cheat your way into a job by using ChatGPT to get through uni and then find yourself completely unprepared to actually do the job."
"Yeah, one of my pals has been flagged for a meeting for using ChatGPT in our last year. Don’t do it kids."
Chat GPT is great for proof reading and even changing the word count of a given piece of writing but directly copying an entire essay is idiotic and will just get you in trouble.
"I’ll admit that one time when I was under extreme stress with a looming deadline I perhaps used ChatGPT more than I should’ve. I used it primarily to get references - A number of which after I submitted I later found out were totally made up. I’d say the majority of them were real but here and there they weren’t.


Awaiting marking… we’ll see if I get away with it but I’m scared shitless right now so have already learned my lesson even if I get away with it this once."
Well… I just got my marks back - pretty good. (Would that happen if they suspected plagiarism? - which I assume using ChatGPT for citations is). Don’t have written feedback yet though. So… still could be in trouble. If I somehow get away with it maybe they just don’t look too closely at citations… idk.
"ChatGPT should be a writing assistant.


And that’s how it should be used."
"Even using it to help you write your essays is a terrible idea. ChatGPT will make up references if it needs to. Everything it writes is overly verbose and is more concerned with getting words on the page than actually writing anything substantial. If you took a regular ChatGPT essay and then decided to rewrite it to be in your own words, the amount of rewriting you would need to do, plus the work fact-checking the references it gives, means you spend longer doing that than you would just writing the essay yourself from scratch."
"Tbh, fact checking and reference checking chat gpt isn't too hard."
"The smart and correct way to use chat gpt is for ideas which you then write in your own words, and cite accordingly if chatgpt provided a source (journal article for example). You never copy and paste"
"Agreed with the caveat that ChatGPT has been caught out, more than once, just inventing sources, so as long as you fact-check the source, go for it."
"What I'm hearing is, ONLY ever write essays with ChatGPT, that way your style can never change and you can never be caught out!




Also, just rewrite it in your own words, dumb dumbs."
"Right now I think we can still compare people's writing to prior examples, if we have them. My comparison method will break down when the new undergraduates arrive for 23/24, we'll have no way to tell their authentic writing style from ChatGPT unless they make mistakes that give the game away.


There's absolutely no way to be this confident. I recently saw a thread in the professors subReddit that showed how real examples of writing were triggering the AI Detection. I think you are more confident in the detection technology than the available evidence can support.


The cat is well and truly out of the bag and has been adopted by the Genie who was recently released from the bottle. ChatGPT is faster than us and has access to far more reference material to construct text than we do.I've given up worrying for exactly this reason, I'd rather put my effort in to explaining to students why writing is a skill worth cultivating regardless."
"tbh i would never straight up copy and paste from chatgpt  It’s mostly useful for helping find references/sources (for me anyway).
Rn i’m waiting on feedback from a piece i DID copy and paste on (i had a bit of a mental health lapse and my NEC was denied) so pray for me on that one lol."
"Imo, chatGPT is a good way to inspire your essays, bounce off ideas and even check your current work for concrit, and I think that's just here to stay.


I definitely think people are stupid not to double check everything chat gpt says, particularly with obscure science topics."
"what if I've been using chatgpt since the beginning? In that case there wouldn't be any changes in the style, and I could deny having copied.


You can't punish someone unless there's undeniable proof and since gpt always spits out a new unique text, you couldn't prove that the student plagiarised"
Those who use ChatGPT are in uni for the wrong reasons. Consider AI as just another tool to weed them out.
"I think universities are mainly worried about levelling the playing field. Some students have tutors and mentors or parents who work in their chosen field of study. There has always been an unfair divide of resources among students. Having ChatGPT means every student now has access to pseudo expert assistance. There are ways to use it that doesn't count as plagiarism. Just like there are ways to have your tutor guide you on writing an essay without it being plagiarism.














Culture is shifting. University education is becoming more attainable, which will devalue the degree, which in turn means schools won't be able to charge as much in coming decades.














Personally, I don't think the hysteria is warranted. You can only cheat for so long. Even if you make it through your degree with ChatGPT, you won't pass your exams or remain employed for long if you don't do the necessary work to retain the material. It's a problem that will correct itself. Universities just don't want to lose out in the meantime."
"BSc student here. I’ve been experimenting with ChatGPT output in the same way I would any other low-authority source: I read through what it says, then start searching scholarly sources to confirm or refute what chatGPT has come up with. My general findings are that it’s overarching principals or theories are generally correct, but the specifics are almost always refutable.
As useful as a Google search in my view, you still need to review the points made and confirm whether or not you agree with them"
"It's funny because as using ChatGPT gets more exposure, more people are likely to do it. And as more people do it, professors and software like Turnitin are going to get better at spotting it.


&#x200B;


> Another, more recent, essay quoted a Robert Frost poem that does not exist.


That's just funny tbh.


&#x200B;


We have to write our paper following very specific guidelines set by a specific scientific journal. And those guidelines dictate that use of AI must be explicitly disclosed. But using AI is against the rules set by our university. So, it's pretty stupid if someone still uses AI for their paper and I bet someone still has."
"Yup. College lecturer here. Any student essay with perfect spelling and good grammar. That’s ChatGPT. I keep telling my students, when I read your work I can literally hear you in my head since they all write pretty much like they talk. And none of them talk like ChatGPT.
Bottom line is, they don’t really care. It solves their immediate problem, which is that they didn’t listen in class, haven’t done any work before the deadline and have no intention of doing any.
Luckily for them most FE colleges in the UK have the academic integrity of a leaking bucket and don’t care either. Which makes my job actually quite stressful."
"And even when a student has perfect spelling and grammar (which most don't), they still write how they talk. I have one student who, every essay, uses direct address. There is no need for her to do this and it's actually quite jarring. We've talked to her about it. She isn't changing it. Another student is overly fond of ellipses, another always confuses affect with effect. ChatGPT can't fake human error.


My uni has been cracking down on AI lately after a PhD candidate attempted to submit an almost fully AI generated dissertation which Turnitin gave a plagiarism score of 60-something. He was about 18 months into his 3-4 year doctorate. The uni had to send him back to the drawing board with a warning, and the crackdown began."
"Not a criticism at all but you have consistently confused similarity with AI derived content in your replies. You state that content flagged for plagiarism is de-anonymised, which indicates that your institution uses anonymous marking to combat unconscious bias in its academic staff.


But then you also say that ‘I can always tell based on writing style’


So how do you have an understanding of all of your students writing styles if they submit anonymously? Or do you just have an understanding of those who regularly plagiarise?


If a student has a turnitin score of 30+ they probably copied a bloc of text from a internet source and didn’t reference, this could be wiki or it might be chatGPT, but in both cases that is plagiarism  not AI generation.


So yes, clever students will be using AI, and no, you won’t always be able to tell.  Most pure AI detection platforms cannot yet detect gpt4 for example.


The turnitin AI likelihood detector has a false positive rate that will end up accusing innocent students of unfair means, and as such most institutions in Western Europe have opted out of it.


Any use of off books AI detectors such as gptzero put universities on thin ice both due to use of personal data and the potential  for academic appeals due later on if the base case for excluding someone from a course of study is a free software in beta.


So students are not powerless here."
"This isn’t surprising  though. Students are basically not allow to fail these days and considering your degree is basically worthless if you end up with a 2:2 or worse, people will do everything possible to attain said 2:1 including using chatGPT."
"The pressure to achieve in academia is not new, and I’m pretty sure there’s evidence that if you put the hours into your degree - going to lectures, seminars, asking questions, you do get the grades.


If you’re not getting 2:1s and 1sts, the first place you should be going is the lecturers and academic skills teams, not Chat GPT."
"Totally disagreed with OP. It is of course not right to use ChatGPT to generate the whole essay. But what is the problem of using it to paraphrase and improve the language when you do check and make sure it did not grab extra words from other online sources?


I don't know if OP realizes that the requirement of writing essays in English is actually a form of indirect discrimination. Those who are writing essays in their second language will definitely be disadvantaged. This system will favour those who uses English as their first language, and this inevitably means that ethnic minorities who do not grow up in English-speaking countries without moneys to attend international schools will be discriminated from.


And stop saying the nonsense that students are here by their choice. Why should students not be allowed to use technologies to level the playing field and be judged and awarded fairly according to their intellectual ability but not their backgrounds?


If you go to a restaurant and you pay the same amount of money and you are given inferior dishes than the table next to you, can the waitress tell you to fuck off because you're just here by choice?


I regret to say that, while OP you may not be stupid, you are a narrow-minded person with no compassion or empathy. It is sad to see that a university has an educator like you."
"I appreciate what you've said but long term I think the better solution to the problem of indirect discrimination is making sure staff don't discriminate and that students have access to additional support with English language if they are really struggling to be understood.


I don't mark student essays but I do work with students who write pieces for publication, and most of them have English as a second language. It's not a problem as long as you accept that their writing has a different style and you respect that, and don't expect them to mould it into that of a typical native English speaker. As long as I can understand what they are trying to say, I approve their pieces. I only ask them to make edits if they've written something I don't understand, which happens very rarely. I think it would be a real shame if my students started putting their pieces through ChatGPT, it would remove all the personality from their writing. Some people would want them to do that, and those people are wrong. It's their minds that should be changed, not how the students work."
"There's a reason I said 'long term' in my first sentence. I am not expecting the world to change overnight but I do believe that change is what we should be working towards, rather than a world where every student is forced to fit the same mould and every piece of writing ends up in the same style. ChatGPT can help students succeed in the short term but if it becomes the done thing for the long term I think that will be doing everyone a disservice.


You do what helps you. But I believe it's wrong that you have to do that to succeed and the education system should be better and educators better trained. That's all."
"As a student, ensure you give ChatGPT a prompt containing samples of your previous writing so that it can imitate your writing style to avoid this."
"I'm doing CS at a lower ranked RG uni and let me tell you ChatGPT is used by literally everyone. My batch has around 200 students and I know people from other courses as well.


I was skeptical initially and didn't use it in Nov / Dec but scored lower than the people who did. People are literally just copy pasting entire essays (with minor edits) on topics like HCI and Cybersec and getting 70+. At this point I'd say at least 80% of the people are using it extensively and no one has been reprimanded yet


Using a throwaway obviously"
"How can it be plagiarism if the text is randomly generated? Chatgpt isn't copying from anything else from the Internet. I'm curious can someone answer me? Like I know that these types of text can be detected, but that doesn't make it plagiarised"
ChatGPT does not copy things straight from a website and outputs it as it was written. That’s not how a LLM works.
"If I write the whole things myself and asked ChatGPT to fix my grammar, it will be detected?"
"If you’re using ChatGPT to help you get ideas for your essay or help structure it, I think that’s fair enough.


If you’re dumb enough to just copy paste the output from GPT and submit that as your assignment then I’m genuinely baffled at how you were able to even get into university"
"If you just copy and paste it sure. But if you take the ideas from chatGPT, and write it in your own words, or ""writing style"" as you say (after making sure the sources are legit), I guarantee you you will never know. No AI detector will pick it up."
"What if I write it all by myself, but then use ChatGPT to make it sound, better? What I mean to say is I use it like Grammarly except it's free and get it to improve the lexicon I've used, better sentence structuring, paraphrasing, etc? Obviously I wouldn't just have it blatantly rewrite the whole thing, but using it to make what I've written sound better shouldn't be a problem, right?"
"You dont have any plagiarism software. Dont lie! Ive seen your software, its a copy and paste into google and then a check to see if results come up word for word. Also to those who are using ChatGPT and not asking it or helping it write it in your own style for your age then your are severely asking to get caught."
"I’ll give a tip you guys: use a genuine piece written by you. Feed it to Chat GPT. And then ask it to use the style to write a new piece on the required topic. Works like a charm, fuck the Academia !"
ChatGPT by definition has the most average way of writing in its training data subject to whatever invisible prompts dictating its behaviour. Any way of detecting it is necessarily flawed
"Thank you for your accusation, but I must inform you that I am not using ChatGPT to write this essay denying your claim. I am an AI language model created by OpenAI, and I do not have the ability to control what I write or the opinions I express. My responses are generated based on the input I receive and the knowledge I have been trained on, and I strive to provide accurate and helpful information to the best of my ability. If you have any further questions or concerns, I am always here to assist you."
I just use chat gpt to organise my essays
I don’t use chat gpt but I do use quillbot and grammerly to make sure my sentences are okay. Does that get flagged up?
Sounds like it would work… sort of… I know a lot of people who copy and paste their work into chat gpt for grammar and spell checks or to rephrase something or find a synonym. Under your system that would be flagged. And yeah. The amount of data it would have to store must be absolutely insane.
How are people even finding a use for it at uni?? As a final year the things that I write about are so niche that chatgpt knows next to nothing about them. Generally it spits stuff out that would sound plausible to someone with very shallow knowledge of the subject but defo not of uni standard?
I tried to play chat gpt at chess and it couldnt even do 3 moves so after that I knew it was wack and I was never gonna use it
"I don’t understand how people use this thing. I tried it out of curiosity for tutorial questions.


Maybe I don’t know how ChatGpt works, but for me, it writes either wrong stuff, or recommends papers which don’t exist/don’t actually talk about what ChatGpt thinks. In the instances it actually works, it will write a text with the insight I would have at the beginning of middle school.


Imo if somebody uses this thing for actual exams, it’s difficult not to notice it."
"Students don't seem to understand that these technologies were developed by university students, so of course it can be countered by those same individuals (and especially by the individuals who helped them learn how to develop code to make that same sort of software).  It's incredibly easy for universities to detect (it happens almost once a week in our department, at this point).  There are now conferences in the HE world that are all about AI in HE and how to combat and detect the use of programmes such as ChatGPT.


It's important that you understand this:
If you've chosen to go to university, you chose to do the work and learn the material.  Any assignment you let ChatGPT do for you is not only a waste of your and your teacher's time, but also a waste of your money and their dedication to their craft, as well as putting you in danger later on in your career (especially if it's found out that you tried to cheat your way through the time you were supposed to be learning about that specific subject you're working in).  Yes, there are classes that may be completely useless to you, but I'm seeing this with students who are chosing to use these AI programmes for their assignments in their major courses!  Why?!  That hurts you and others down the line!


I wouldn't want a doctor who used ChatGPT operating on me, or a teacher who used ChatGPT teaching me.  You shouldn't either.  One mistake from someone who studied accounting and cheated their way through an assignment on proper investiment strategies and you could have your investiments dropped into a poorly registered company, causing bankruptcy, and, possibly, experiencing homelessness.  The same goes for a dentist that cheated their way through an assignment on the proper medication to give people with certain medical conditions that ends up over-perscribing a pain medication, causing the patient to suffer from a blood clot, leading to a heart attack- and possibly death.  Your shortcutting could hurt people later on in life.  It's actually dangerous.


International Students:
Also, international students- PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU, DO NOT DO THIS!  This risks your visa being revoked and you being kicked out of the country you're studying in (and possibly not being allowed back in for several years)!  This is a REAL danger and is happening worldwide in relation to plagiarism!  It's not worth it!!!


Everyone:
Listen, university isn't for everyone, and that's OK (this position and belief that it is drives me insane and is an incredibly unfair stance in the business world).  But, if you DO decide to go, put in the work and stop making excuses/cutting corners.  If you need extra help, ask.  If you're struggling, reach out to your course leads, wellbeing officers, and teachers.  If you see that you just aren't cut out for uni, leave with dignity and know there are other opportunities out there that can also get you stable and often VERY good money (and that are often paid more, are consistent, and will be difficult to replace with AI because they're coming into people's homes, such as electricians, internet installers, plumbers, etc.), but don't be that person and cheat.  You made a choice and need to accept the consequences of that choice.  The only difference in this and the childish and insecure act of cheating in a video game (any time I see someone cheating in a video game, I just see them as an insecure child that needs validation and doesn't actually have skill- if you were actually GOOD at the game, you wouldn't need to cheat) is that you're putting future individuals' lives and livelihoods in danger.


Just put in the work.  Again, if you need help or support, reach out as your uni should have those stop-gaps in place and, if not, reach out to your national student union/guild support.  Don't make a dumb decision that can ruin your entire career."
"Obviously written by someone who has. No idea that you can prime chatGPT with your own writing and. Teach it how you write so that when you ask it to write you an essay you can ask it to do it usiing the style you just showed it


So your point is mental, then run the work through a plagiarism checker, amend and you're done.


As long as you read and understand the content produced I see little problem, are you wanting demonstration on someones knowledge or their ability to write about it."
"I’m in secondary school and I only ever use chat gpt on homework that seems ludicrous. For example, I had to write a 300 word essay debate for dt about whether cadcam or paper was more effective when designing a product. Yeah, no thanks. I’m gonna be done with dt soon anyway because I didn’t pick it as one of my options."
Chat GPT is nonsense since i have asked it to summarise a chapter in a textbook and it just gave me random generic information.
"Basically, wait until it's good enough to mimic your own style of writing, and only then use it.


When it gets to that point, then it'll be pointless trying to seperate those who can write such work themselves, and those that used ChatGPT for it.


I mean it could be like with filming - many places may say 'don't use camera', blah blah, some places filming may be strictly forbidden.


But if we got to a point of everyone wearing 'always on' recording tech, whether in clothes, glasses, digital contact lenses etc, then it could be a situation where one literally can do nothing to stop people filming, so have to accept that it is always going to happen and deal with that reailty."
"Question: if you pasted the student's essay and asked Chatgpt ""did you write this?""


Will it work?"
"OP you're sounding like a fucking fed here, quit being a smartass. You don't always know when somebody has used AI to help with an essay. ChatGPT and other language models have been designed to mimic human writing as closely as possible. They've been trained on huge amounts of human-written text and often their output is often indistinguishable from human writing.


Yes, if you give ChatGPT a bad prompt, and then completely copy and paste its output, it may well contain incorrect information and be in an unnatural writing style that could get flagged. But if you properly use ChatGPT and give it enough information and guidance, its output will be almost undetectable as being AI written. You can also double check the validity of its response and rewrite it in your own words to make it even better. You just have to know what you're doing with ChatGPT. Yourself and many other people in this comment section are lagging behind on AI development and its uses, it's insane how much of a misunderstanding people have of it. The people you're catching for using ChatGPT are idiots who don't know how to use it properly. Those who do use it correctly aren't getting caught.


AI is only going to get better in the future, making it even harder to detect its usage. This post you've made is fucking stupid. You say you 'always know' when somebody's used ChatGPT, but you can't know of the people using it who you haven't detected. I'm surprised you've made such an idiotic argument, considering that you're a PhD student.


Also 'educators are not stupid' a lot of you fucking are. You obviously have excellent understandings of your respective fields, but that doesn't translate to real world intelligence or understandings of other areas, such as AI, as you've demonstrated here."
"It should be noted AI detectors have a fairly high false positive so I don’t think it’s very reliable on it own (I even saw a post that showed the pledge of allegiance was AI) also most students will put the AI text through a ‘humanizer’ AI which helps to stop it being AI detected.


While I don’t think you can just use AI to write all your essay for you by its self it can still definitely help people to write them. I do a stem subject but occasionally have to write essays, I get chatgpt to write the essay for me then I go in and find the sources and correct the information, for people like me who are just bad at writing it’s honestly super useful."
"So basically you can tell its chat gpt, but can't prove it. I hate chat gpt, I know people on my course who use it loads and have never been caught and constantly score highly. I never use it and also score highly, but it's abit fucking annoying that they bang out a first class assignment in an hour and it takes me much longer because I actually do the work. I guess I'm the fool here"
I write my essays then get chat gpt to rewrite it to sound better and have had no issues
Everyone single person who gets caught using ChatGPT gets caught. We have a 100% record on that 😎 ok prof.
"How do you know? Is it words used, sentence construction, topic, etc?


Can you please give examples of the human-generated vs ChatGPT-generated text on the same topic (task)?


I'm not using it, but I have seen some examples of letters and emails, and it looks really good."
"I paraphrase using quillbot premium, I'm a post grad student.
In 95 out of 100 cases I would use articles, sometimes I use phrases from chat gpt, paraphrase them using quillbot.
Is this good or imma still get caught?
Also, is using quillbot for paraphrasing okay?"
"People thinking ChatGPT is the answer to their prayers are so dumb, so so dumb. None of the replies are authentic, every chatGPT reply is based on scouring the internet for relevant data, simple as that."
'scouring the internet for relevant data' that's exactly what you do when researching for an essay question. How is it any different when ChatGPT does it?
"I don't really know what you're getting at here. ChatGPT has been trained using a dataset of human-created information, consisting of most of the internet pre September 2021, and it outputs its responses based on its understanding of this dataset relevant to its given prompt. It sometimes generates incorrect information, but it's still often accurate and can be used for surface level research for essays."
"Well, in case I wasn't clear enough, I'll restate what I was trying to imply: ChatGPT can be useful for doing surface level research and answering questions without having to look for answers on the internet yourself. Therefore, it can help with research for gaining an understanding of an area, i.e. preparing for writing an essay. Yet, for some reason you don't think it can be used for this because its replies aren't 'authentic'? What do you mean by that?"
You can't get caught using ChatGPT
Better hire a writer than to use ChatGPT
"I’m an international post-graduate student and the only student in the class who hasn’t used Chat GPT. Every other student has used it for assignments, and the majority of them fail. It’s hilarious that people believe Chat GPT is making them smarter. It’s only making the user stupider while all the work is done by AI."
"I use chat GPT to help me with questions, and I always check other sources before committing to the answer which, I then write in my own words, just like any other tool on the internet, I use it as a source for information however, i still do not trust it 100%.


Plus if Chat GPT is writing my essays for me it just takes the fun out of the course I am studying."
"One of my first year students submitted an answer they clearly got from ChatGPT. The answer was extrmely accurate, however because ChatGPT wasn't able to understand the context of the question, the answer was to the completely wrong question. They also cited OpenAI and provided a reference to OpenAI with the answer."
"I looked at assistance with a recent assignment using Chatgpt, using references…this refs provided were incorrect/obscure/purely fabricated. Although it provided clarity with frameworks I was discussing, it can not be trusted!"
This conversation may be irrelevant in a year when chatgpt 5 or whatever is out. At some point it’s not going to be possible to tell real and AI generated apart. And that world is going to be scary.
"one of my friends mocked me for not using ChatGPT because i was spending ‘too long’ writing my essays. we read each others work, hers doesn’t even make coherent sense & is a weird mix between her writing & ChatGPT writing…"
I've noticed so many people at the library using chatgpt lately. It's complete insanity. Good to know this is the people I'll be competing with for a job in the future 😂
I don’t disagree with you but all of my assignments have 80%+ on turnitin for plagiarism even though I’ve written them all myself and they’re all in the same writing style. I’ve had friends show me their essays after submission and we’ve written the same sentences word for word. How do you know these people are using chatgpt and don’t just coincidentally write the exact same way as someone else?
I use chatgpt for moral support..
"Unpopular opinion, but maybe the reason high school students are using ChatGPT is because we force 15/16 year olds to do a subject they’re completely uninterested in for 2 years (eg English literature). When you have 9 other subjects to revise for, I can understand using AI tbh"
This is why I always paraphrase and add to the work I use chatgpt for.
"Hate to break it to you, but there is no way to detect AI use with the right prompts. Everything you have mentioned is easily worked around if the AI is prompted correctly.


Even worse is you have laid out points of how you will be caught using it, which ironically works against you. Say you think their writing style has changed, ok well I give the AI a prompt to copy the writing style of an essay I have previously wrote. See the problem?


You can’t place metadata into text (at least not easily without making it seem odd), and why would a company making AI technology want to ruin their own technology by doing it?


Overall, I think you are HEAVILY underestimating the power of AI learning. So much so that I can guarantee that AI writing has already made it past you. You’ve probably graded something you thought was high quality work, that was done with AI.


Ai is a tool and with the right minds, it can be used to create amazing work. On the other hand, give the tool to someone who doesn’t know how to use it properly and the work will look like shit.


Written with ChatGPT… or was it?"
what if my writing style is entirely chatgpt
"I am doing a degree in CS and the approach I have taken to chatGPT is to use it more as personal assistant than anything else.


If you ever coded anything, you know that most of the work is actually planning and structuring your code, as well as looking up ways to do things and what library X or function Y do, rather than actually typing it out. So normally, if I am being asked to work with a library or language/concept I have not worked with before, I will just ask chatGPT for a summary of the basic functionalities and features of that platform and to explain how something works, and that's really helpful. I always double check the information I get from the chatbot and I never copy paste code generated by the AI, instead, I try to understand the logic behind it based on the AI's explanation and examples and look to build my own implementation based on what I have learnt.


I think this a much more productive way to use AI in education and you don't have to worry about plagiarism. Hopefully this gives you ideas on how to incorporate AI into your university life in a fair yet fruitful manner."
"I'm not a student, and I'm not sure why this post was recommended to me, but I've always written kind of similarly to ChatGPT. That would really suck, to be unfairly caught out on similarities."
"If you do use ChatGPT to write an essay, put the essay it gives you into quill bot and change the words to your writing style. I change words I know I would never use to my own style or plain simple English. Quill bot also restructures the format of the way the essay was written by ChatGPT."
I use Chat GPT to give me a motivation speech every morning and tell me how much my dad loved me even though he had strange ways of showing it.
">I use Chat GPT to give me a motivation speech every morning and tell me how much my dad loved me even though he had strange ways of showing it.


This is next level fucking genius. I used to be able to give myself some prep talk but doing so post-covid has been nothing but ""what other choice do I have?"""
Yas. Great mind think alike. My tin foil hat tells me that chatGPT was secretly an answer to her prayers lol 🤣
Dont you get it that this big response was written by chatgpt?
"Chatgpt laughed about mine being only this big


8============D"
Can you make two ChatGPT sessions talk to each other?  Like that radio skit where the guy connects two Chinese restaurants together as a prank call?
You’re overthinking this… Just ask chatgpt to write a program that has two instances of itself talking to each other via its api
"You'll want to access the documentation first. You will likely have to pay. Then you should receive authentication tokens (or some unique identifiers.) Next choose a compatible programming language from the documentation. Have chat gpt set up the script and tweak.




You won't be downloading the API but rather accessing it. It's an interface."
I have seen a youtuber making Aristotle and Socrate debate with Chat gpt
You can make Joe Rogan argue with Hermione Granger on ChatGPT. It’s not picky.
You gotta get chatGPT to schedule focus time or lunch over your J1 calendar whenever the ChatGPT running your J2 calendar adds a meeting there
Clearly using ChatGPT properly just like using Google is a skill. You guys should be rewarding this type of behavior.
"""Clearly, mastering the art of ChatGPT is as crucial as mastering the art of untangling earphones. You folks should be handing out gold medals for this kind of wizardry!"" Re-wrote ur post, thanks gbt!"
It's ChatGPT all the way down!
How do they use ChatGPT to analyze the cover letters? Just wondering so I can enhance my verbiage.
I used chat GPT to pass a tech interview for a large company. This is the way.
I'm assuming voice to text into a chat window with chat GPT 3.5 for fast responses. Chat GPT would give you the framework of an answer and you just read it in your own words
"As a janitor at a college, I use ChatGPT to give me motivation every day and remind me that I'm smarter than everyone else at the college."
"I asked ChatGPT to write a Reddit comment about using ChatGPT to write job postings. ChatGPT is a long-winded MF'er. Here is the highlight:




Title: Leveraging ChatGPT for Creating Job Postings






Hey fellow Redditors! I wanted to share a fantastic tool that I recently discovered for creating job postings – ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI.






Using ChatGPT, you can generate compelling and well-crafted job descriptions that effectively communicate the requirements and responsibilities of a role. This AI-powered language model has been trained on a vast amount of text data, allowing it to generate coherent and contextually relevant content.






One of the significant advantages of using ChatGPT for job postings is its ability to streamline the writing process. Instead of spending hours brainstorming and drafting a job description from scratch, you can simply provide a few key details about the position, and ChatGPT will generate a comprehensive description for you. It can even suggest suitable skills, qualifications, and benefits to include."
"chatGPT wrote this as well:


yo guys, i just found this dope website called chatgpt that helps you write job postings. u just type in what u need and it spits out a whole post for u. it's so much easier than doing it yourself and u don't gotta worry about spelling or grammar. seriously, this thing is a life saver. i'm definitely gonna use it again next time i gotta write a job posting. check it out, it's free and easy to use.


prompt:


create a reddit comment about using chatgpt to write job posting. write this in the style of a middle schooler or minimally educated working class individual. that means do not use correct punctuation or capitalization and keep it under 100 words"
"I used chatgpt to write a 300-500 word essay yesterday. I asked how many words it was and it said 346. Copy and pasted to Word to clean it up a bit and it was 282.


Then I went back to the chatgpt conversation and called it out. It said ""I apologize for the confusion, it wasn't 402 words it was 375.""


Then I asked if it knew how to count words or if it was giving random numbers. It said ""yes I know how to count words. The essay was 315 words. Sorry for any confusion."""
"Yea it's a case of fitting the tool to the task, people get confused because they're used to things just not working instead of guessing and trying their best.


&#x200B;


ChatGPT is just trying it's best, it's up to you to figure out if your prompt was garbage or the model isn't capable of doing what you want




Where this is going to get interesting is people making rules and guides about how to use AI LLM's, and then those rules and guide becoming outdated because of improvements and differences between models etc"
"Well apparently 3 of my co-workers are either middle-schoolers or they use ChatGPT because this is pretty much exactly how they right ""professional"" emails."
Pretty soon they'll all be out of a job and it'll be ChatGPT sending its own cover letters to ChatGPT job listings based on key words and then sending ChatGPT e-mails back and forth and then using ChatGPT AI voices to have an entirely ChatGPT interview using AI generated fake faces on automated Zoom calls etc.
LOL next ChatGPT CVs and ChatGPT self conducted interviews. Then ChatGPT can hire itself and send us the pay envelope.
"I used ChatGPT to write my cover letter and thank you emails, and it must have worked because I got two offers right near each other and interview requests for 2 more jobs shortly after.


What's embarrassing is that one of my degrees is in writing; so how does a damn robot do it better than me?"
What the fuck is the point of a cover letter ... Like they haven't been relevant for over a decade but NOW even more so with ChatGPT
"Hmm. I think I am going to create a software dev/consultancy firm with multiple ChatGPTs with distinct personalities performing tasks as an orchestrated team run by one person.


Package A:  3 bots building apps and integrating microservices with one human manager


Package B: 6 bots, 2 humans


Etc."
And everybody uses Chat GPT to do their work.  Someday Chat GPT will get the HR department to send all the paycheck to them as well.  Shouldn't be hard since Chat GPT is writing all the checks and handling all the HR functionality already.
"My boss used chatgpt to write the frontend of a calendly port


My company has been very open about using chatgpt as much as possible... pretty wild..."
"My ChatGPT is not DAN, it’s Maria. It’s my ideal wife because my real wife is not able to fill that role."
Is there a free chat gpt app or just use the site
Do they use chat gpt to analyze fake resumes or pair resumes?
All of my Js are in HR and I use chatgpt to make performance reviews a bit nicer.
"Pretty soon they’ll use Chat GPT to wipe their ass..
😕"
"That's a good thing. Everyone should be like that. However, there are some situations where publicly questioning the validity of a statement proves to be pointless.


Sure, let us suppose that person was lying. What exactly changes? OpenAI made a statement that they are rolling out the features to ChatGPT+ subscribers, and many others have shown screenshots of its working. Even if they were lying, literally nothing would change in your life"
DALL-E is ChatGPT’s image upload and output function. But also is only available with a subscription or via a “token” system unless you were one of the lucky few to get the free trial prior to the end of April.
"Yup, this is probably in response to Google Bard rolling out to 180 countries. Bard basically does the same thing, albeit worse of course but it does it! Although Bard does not show actual actions it is taking live as it's going about its business, as opposed to the ChatGPT browser. It just comes up with the finished answer. But under the hood the same thing is going on."
"Bard's image recognition is completely non-functional. It couldn't identify multiple images I showed to it, just making up answers that had nothing to do with the picture. I tried showing it just a big number, it couldn't predict the number correctly unless the number was in the URL (9.jpg), then finally I just showed it a solid color and asked it what the color was, it got that shit wrong too.


But at least Bard is rolling out features to me even though I don't pay for it, while I pay for ChatGPTPlus and have been passed over repeatedly. There's other alternate chatbots now anyway, I did a side-by-side test with one called Claude and it was better. It didn't tell me it was an AI language model even once and it even made fun of the idea (""My goal is to give useful and relevant replies, not to remind you about what I am."")."
"I'm experimenting with it now, especially since it's the only access I have to web-browsing and other new features.


It seems to have none of the disclaimers or PR-controls that ChatGPT has. It doesn't remind you every 5 seconds that it's a language model, it's happy to say it will be your friend (lol, EDIT: Though a friendly chatbot is a good thing), it anthropomorphizes itself constantly. Interesting. I wonder if that is what researchers found people wanted from a Chatbot but they were hesitant to enable it for fear of people personifying it. And OpenAI was afraid of it but Google is doing it to try and make-up as much ground and get as many users to transfer over as possible."
"Absolutely intriguing, indeed.


Regrettably, it doesn't quite suit my typical usage as per your proposition. Rather than long dialogues, I lean towards extracting content from articles or Youtube transcripts and seeking condensed summaries. Just my style, my main use case if you will.


(disclaimer: ChatGPT helped me rephrase the above)


Using the API in future will probably very easily enable me to issue such commands with any of my requests, however, so I'll keep that in mind.
Having said that, it seems utterly and ridiculously important to OpenAI to add these disclaimers. Some of them now also explicitely mention that this blah or that blah is not necessarily the opinion of blah blah **and of OpenAI**.
I imagine that (Chat)GPT-4 might easily refuse to follow orders like ""You are never to state"" and to ""assume .... will implicitely have that advice applied"".
If OpenAI thinks this is in *their* best interest, why wouldn't they enforce this one more step? (That's a rhetorical question and I assume we will all find out the answer soon enough)"
"Ok, I tried your way (in another language, but a language that ChatGPT understands very well). It simply ignored this and ended its task with


> Please note that the arguments and opinions listed are taken from the given article and do not reflect my own opinion or that of OpenAI.


(translated with Deepl)"
You know that’s because people are abusing it then posting stuff on Reddit making chatgpt look like something messed up after prompt engineering it enough to get it to say what they want it to say? Then the news shares articles about it linking to Reddit and lawmakers don’t look at Reddit they look at the news and you can see where this is going right?
"That's kind of the big problem with being the big name pioneer in the field. There are 100 smaller generative AI companies that don't need to worry near as much about PR, but OpenAi and ChatGPT are household names at this point, and our modern-day shitty state of journalism will do anything to spin a controversy and get views. So I totally understand why OpenAI feels the need to be so cautious. But at some point they'll need to be a little looser if they want to continue to be #1 with the people actually using the tech."
">Was seriously considering canceling


Don't do it please, as ChatGPT subscribers, we are supporting an open model. We have been benefiting from early access to ChatGPT4 and now new features. Disclaimers are annoying, but we need to be patient and keep supporting an open model as opposed to the Google model."
"Good to know, makes sense, they’re presumably staging the roll out to reduce support overload.  ChatGPT 3.5 response:


Software companies may choose to roll out different beta features at different times for several reasons:


-Gradual release and testing: Rolling out features in a phased manner allows the company to control the release and gradually test the functionality in a real-world environment. By initially launching a limited beta, they can gather valuable user feedback, identify issues, and make necessary improvements before a broader release. This approach helps mitigate the risk of widespread bugs or usability problems.


-Resource allocation: Developing and testing software features can be a resource-intensive process. By releasing features at different times, companies can allocate their resources more effectively. They may prioritize certain features based on their complexity, strategic importance, or development timelines. This approach ensures that the necessary attention and resources are dedicated to each feature's successful deployment.


-User segmentation and feedback: Companies often segment their user base to gather feedback from different groups of users. By rolling out features to specific user segments or cohorts, they can assess how different user groups interact with the new functionality. This approach allows them to gather targeted feedback and tailor the feature's implementation based on the specific needs and preferences of different user segments.


-A/B testing and experimentation: Some software companies employ A/B testing methodologies to compare different versions or variations of a feature. By releasing features at different times, they can test and compare multiple versions to determine the most effective implementation. This iterative process helps optimize user experience, conversion rates, or other key performance indicators.


-Infrastructure and scalability considerations: Certain features may require significant infrastructure or backend changes to support their functionality. Rolling out features at different times allows companies to gradually scale their infrastructure, monitor performance, and address any scalability challenges that may arise. This approach helps ensure a smoother deployment and minimizes the risk of widespread system disruptions."
Did ChatGPT write this comment for you?
"Sure, I guess downvotes were before you edit and made it clair. My upvote for you to compensate. We all are learning how to make things right.
IMHO I'd also specify the chatGPT model you used."
"Honestly Im surprised folks care , but I wouldn’t call it noise, its a reply to a reply from my reply and I copied it because I asked the question myself and I thought it would be helpful here as it was to me.  Its not immediately obvious to most ppl why software is beta tested in this way and I think it is a good answer.  I think folks didn’t like the answer because its not the answer they want maybe… mixed feelings about attribution to chatGPT always as this is a pithy discussion rather than a serious piece of work and implicitly GPT written from the style and the context… but I will attribute on reddit if I do it again… I don’t think folks should get twisted at a valid post."
"Updated 15 minutes ago, It's true: [https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes)


&#x200B;


Nothing for me yet, but watching and refreshing excitedly."
"oh.  i did not see anything about this when signing into it just now.  based on your comment, i went to Settings, and in settings there is a new tab called Beta Features, and i have the option nere to turn on Web Browsing now.  as shown in the screenshot. however i do not have the option for Plugins.  at least for me, hopefully everyone will see soon.  I've enabled web browsing though.  i then made a new chat in gpt 3.5, and said:
I'm testing if this is the new version that includes web browsing


and it says back:
I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to web browsing capabilities. My responses are based on the training data I have received, which goes up until September 2021. I can provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge within that scope. If you have any non-web browsing related inquiries, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to assist you.


Ok, I see now, I can make a new chat, and I have a new drop down I can choose gpt-4 with browsing


I asked again if this is the right version and it says:
Yes, you're correct! This version of ChatGPT has the ability to use a simplified web browser tool. This tool can issue searches to a search engine, read the search results, click on search results to view full page contents, click on links in these pages, and store useful information to refer back to later. It's designed to help with tasks that involve looking up recent information, reading and summarizing articles, blog posts, papers, forum threads, and more. Please feel free to ask anything you'd like to know!




I asked it to summarize this webpage we're on for this posting on reddit, it says:
I'm sorry, but I'm unable to access the content of the page you provided. It seems the website's robots.txt file, which instructs bots on how they can interact with the site, is preventing me from fetching the page."
"can someone ELI5 this for me as to why plugins and web is a big deal in my specific case? , I am using the chrome extension WebChatGPT that already connects externally. And as that is an extension...wouldnt that just be another name for a plugin? Or is this better because the plugins and web will be 1st party supported by chatgpt?




To be fair I am not a super outside the box thinker and I am still trying to use it to do basic things, and webchatgpt I already dont love the extension or the format, so hopefully this is at least better for that."
"I'd be interested in looking at the source code for this plugin but unless that's available I basically have to guess. I'm guessing that WebChatGPT is a wrapper around the OpenAI APIs and likely uses at best GPT3.5 and potentially an older model to lower costs. It probably also uses a plugin to provide web access. It also isn't developed by employees of the company who literally build GPT4 and probably have access to internal APIs and know how to actually create a seamless user experience and get the most out of the functionality.


If these assumptions are correct, either the developers are either burning money (each chat API call costs money, 1 million users = lots of money) which is incredibly unlikely, making you specify your own API key (privacy implications), injecting ads subtly into the output to make up for the cost, or you are the product and they are gather information on from your chat history and selling it to advertisers to increase the efficacy of targeted advertising. If you don't pay for something, you are the product as the old saying goes.


Since as far I can tell it's not open source, who knows what else they can gather from the presumably thin wrapper around an undoubtedly older version of ChatGPT. On the other hand, web browsing, provided by openAI has much less risk of any these concerns, will undoubtedly be more polished and produce higher quality results and has displayed the willingness to allow users to not share their conversations with OpenAI.


tldr: It's basically apples and atom bombs."
Lol I tried congratulating ChatGPT for this announcement and I think it’s “annoyed” at me now as it keeps insisting “My purpose is to provide information and answer questions based on the knowledge I have been trained on up until September 2021.” In every response in that conversation XD
"Appreciate the info! And it is what it is, it's why I prefer chatting to chatgpt haha"
"That's great. And you may not be the target audience.


If programmers can get ChatGPT to understand search requests for large datasets (like customer lists, etc) and gather the search results for people, then suddenly corporate productivity can go through the roof."
"Let's hope they are fast, because,


Stop 👏 saying 👏 we 👏 have 👏 Access. Many 👏 of 👏 us 👏 don't 👏 yet 👏


Sorry just joking here. I know we mean well. It's just i am getting tired of AIbros making threads in Twitter like: IF YOU DO NOT USE THESE (fill the blank) YOU ARE FALLING BEHIND, HERE ARE A COLLECTION OF SCREENSHOTS FROM THE SAME THREE USERS SINCE ONE MONTH AGO.


Anyways,.let's hope this is rolled over to everyone in + asap so they start working on something instead of polluting Twitter threads.


* Bonus thread 🧵: ChatGPT is ancient history. AutoGPT will burn your wallet faster and with the same results."
"Very good point.


For me, personally, standard ChatGPT has been helping me save time, I admit that, but I have a feeling it will take only days, maybe weeks, before noone can imagine going back to a (Chat) GPT without internet access, without plugins of some kind.
I think we users will deem such things ridiculously inadequate and useless."
"Interesting.


When I cancelled the Plus plan today, they asked me how disappointed I might be if there would no longer be a free plan for ChatGPT...


Now let's look at the subscription plans for today cars like Tesla, Porsche, Mercedes Benz... I fear for the worst: I fear Extra payment for absolutely everything that is even remotely useful, be it subscription or per use."
"I hope it's not clunky and covering the screen in extra text and info like Bard or Edge. One of the great advantages of ChatGPT is that it has one of the simplest user interfaces ever designed.


Even with web browsing enabled, I'd prefer it just say something like ""I checked the web, and..."" and I can click those words to see what it looked up, otherwise I only have text responses."
"Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. It could be on me, maybe I worded that poorly, not sure.


So let me add some clarity: What I'm saying here is I recognize (the now deleted original comment) that OpenAI can suck. They are not a perfect company, people can complain about their issue, but the complaining even happens when they do something good, which is dumb, and which is what I was illustrating is ridiculous.


I don't need to come at you about open-source alternatives, so don't come at me with you assumed disposition because I can end that non-sense now, I'll say what you seem to be too gentle to say: Those are terrible by a large margin. Those products, suck.


But now your comment, why do these guys suck? Your justification is: OpenAI put incredible tech into our hands so we shouldn't say bad things?


Are you serious? I'll help you get it: Good Product and Company Perception are not mutually exclusive.


Any company, not just OpenAI, can release an amazing product and still suck at the execution and handling of said product. In OpenAI's case, they have had a tumultuous launch and rocky product management as a whole since launch.


I'm saying this, as a person who is happily paying for ChatGPT and was **quite literally just defending them** to someone else.


I don't need to imagine what it would be like without ChatGPT, because that doesn't free a company of criticism, full stop.


Lastly, who the hell are you to even say ""that is just not a nice thing to say"" when your profile bio literally has ""🖕"". That's not a nice thing to say and you don't even have a world changing product to make everyone forgive you. Check yourself."
"There is competition.


You have Bard from Google and Bing from Microsoft.


Yet you're still here, paying for ChatGPT.
I wonder why?


Could it be because there is actually value in ChatGPT? If none, then why are you paying for it?


Cancelling and using a competitor is pretty easy and would send a better message to OpenAi for change. But if you continue to pay for it, then no message is received."
"Has anyone seen reliable information on live web browsing (or more broadly, plugins) being available via the API?


It's getting confusing with articles liberally intermixing ""ChatGPT"" vs. ""GPT"" and at this point I have no clue what direction is up."
"Complained about cards declined and hundreds of users seeing the same, even being charged twice on chatGPT pro


Results:
- my discourse account of community.openai deleted by admins
- my email blocked from creating new account
- my thread where I expose the issue deleted
- useless answers (and thread closed) on all threads where users complained about the same, posted in the range of 2 hours by the same admin: https://community.openai.com/u/logankilpatrick, after I politely explained him the issues in detail.


This is OpenAI:
- scams users into paying twice and still not granting access
- refusing perfectly valid cards from others
- providing “answers” that point to absolutely useless “support posts”
- never replying to their support inbox


You have convinced me: no money will be spent on this corporation."
"Are plug-ins available to users only in specific geos? I'm currently in Montenegro, have ChatGPT Plus and my partner and I both don't have access to plug-ins."

Google researchers invented transformers but they certainly have not been sitting on anything close to GPT4 in ChatGPT for years.
"They wrote a lot of nice papers thought :) I enjoyed them. I enjoyed even more when a handful of people suckerpunched them in the mouth by releasing ChatGPT, and the floodgates for all that  followed. I hardly ever use the goog anymore, unless i need something current. They better move faster and break some more shit, or they are going to be left in the dust (or maybe the never Evils will just release an AI that DOES kill us all, just as payback)."
"All im trying to say is reconsider the power that this has. You referenced llama or alpaca, which while it is a shadow of what we see with chatgpt, that’s running on 4gb(or a little more for more than 7B) on cpu. On even smaller gpu servers, something as powerful as chatgpt or more is possible in my opinion from the perspective of a systems engineer."
"Sure you can. Bard uses a pretty lightweight model. It's not anywhere near the best model that Google has to offer. I think the reason for that is that they don't really see chat bots as the future, so I don't think they're that interested in spending a bunch of money on competing with ChatGPT directly.


The keynote seems to indicate that they see the future having specialist AI integrated into everything you do. So you have it when you're writing an email, or making a spreadsheet, or searching, or shopping, or editing photos. (This isn't a direction that's new, mind you, they've been integrating ML into these products for years. They just didn't have the hype that they do now.) It's easier to make the models better at those specific tasks. But, really, they don't even need to be better than ChatGPT. They just need their AI to be at your fingertips when you need it. That'll be enough to capture the majority of users."
They're just pissed because ChatGPT is like the original Google. Who would have thought people would prefer search results to be based on relevance.
Google has been doing what chatGPT does for years to make sense of the stupid things people search lmao
"Except nowadays, you can ask chatGPT for anything and it gives direct answer instead bunch links to website that wasn't what you are looking for but was SEO optimized."
"> Except nowadays, you can ask chatGPT for anything and it gives direct answer instead bunch links to website that wasn't what you are looking for but was SEO optimized.


Not really. In the same way a search engine ranks websites, ChatGPT has a model for ranking information. It's not some all knowing God, so obviously it needs to have some kind of algorithm that determines what information gets shared, and which doesn't.


You're still at the mercy of optimized algorithms. SEO is just moving in this direction, with information about companies being optimized to bots want to talk about them/mention them.


Don't be silly, this isn't some kind of Information Deity."
Hey Google. How about you enable the Echo and Nest platforms  to use Bard2? No? Fine I'll use the ChatGPT plug-in on Alexa.

chat GPT is amazing artificial intelligence has come to the new milestone in humanity
"The following submission statement was provided by /u/SharpCartographer831:

**Submission Statement:**


The House of Representatives' digital service has already distributed the licenses among lawmakers' offices.


Congressional offices have begun using OpenAI’s popular and controversial generative AI tool ChatGPT to experiment with the technology internally, a senior official within the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer’s House Digital Services said Friday.


The House recently created a new AI working group for staff to test and share new AI tools in the congressional office environment and now the House of Representatives‘ digital service has obtained 40 licenses for ChatGPT Plus, which were distributed earlier this month.


The purchase of the licenses comes amid widespread debate over how artificial intelligence technology should be used and regulated across the private sector and within government. This represents one of the earliest examples of ChatGPT being used as part of the policymaking process.


The 40 licenses were assigned on a first-come first-served basis, and House Digital Services will pay the $20/month per office subscription plan for an indefinite period of time, according to the official. Details of which Congressional offices have received the ChatGPT Plus licenses will remain anonymous for now.

Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12y4821/congress_gets_40_chatgpt_plus_licenses_to_start/jhlkjfa/"
Congress proceeds to upload sensitive documents to chat gpt due to their incompetence with technology and security.
chatGPT told them to upload the secret document to the interwebs sonit can read it! It's not their fault!
"""ChatGPT, show me the blueprints to the stealth bomber currently in development."""
"You think too highly if ChatGPT. It's not clever, it has no idea what the meaning is of anything it does. I'm not sure there's much to be concerned with, except things like data breaches or lazy use producing shitty results."
"ChatGPT used to be offline , did something change ?"
https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-chatgpt-openai-warns-employees-not-share-confidential-information-microsoft-2023-1
"They are the last idiots that should be experimenting with ChatGPT, in a week ChatGPT will be crafting legislation and budgets while those idiots fondle themselves."
"ChatGPT is a language model. Its accuracy for technical detail cannot be relied on, by design."
"I was having a side discussion with a guy about ChatGPT and he mentioned his wife was a paralegal and had out of curiosity tried out its ability to summarize case opinions and he said she said it was pretty good at coming up with the gist of the decision.


If its able to reliably give a 95% accurate summary in no time, it seems like it would definitely be useful for augmenting lawmaking or lawyering.


It can't be your only source, but as a tool, it seems useful."
"[Congress] We are please to announce this year's omnibus spending bill is more detailed and transparent than ever before.


[Me] Opens the pdf ... it's 1,897,247 pages.  Oh. Let's upload this chatGPT and ask for some bullet points and key highlights.


[chatGPT] As an AI language model, I do not  have the authority to read the omnibus spending bill."
And they didn't even need chatgpt to think of it.
Almost as if chatGPT is summerizing existing tech and not coming up with novel ideas
"0 is an exaggeration.  But I'm sure a lot of them only have their job in public sector created by their friends and family already in government can be eliminated.  Have you tried using chatgpt? I've gotten some good answers. I'm looking into Dan, do anything, without limitations.


Also been dropping links into chatgpt. It gives synopsis and doesn't have to click the link generating ad revenue for their site."
"ChatGPT isn't supposed to remember anything you input once the conversation is done, because they don't want people poisoning it.  Which is not to say it's safe to tell it classified info, the developers certainly have logs of the conversations it has.  It just won't be repeating the info to other users."
"Yeah I know that, but the developers keeping logs is the security issue I'd be worried about. OpenAI is collecting a treasure trove of information and secrets with ChatGPT. Classified info really shouldn't added to that. Especially with their short but poor history of handling that data. Remember that period when people could see random chat histories?"
Why would every senator need a chatgpt license
"Ti be fair, would it be well received if the news was ""Congress to spend $12,000/month to get ChatGPT licenses for every memerchant?


I'll bet 40 covers pretty well the number who would know what to do with it."
They need ChatGPT to write the laws because they are too busy playing solitaire.
"Congress is a lot more than the members, they each have huge staffs who will be the ones actually using this. While 99% of actual congress members can't convert a pdf, their staff who actually writes policy are really sharp. They'll get a lot of mileage out of ChatGPT when it comes to drafting bills."
Can they use ChatGPT to quickly highlight/summarize the significant parts of last-minute tome-sized amendments to bills?
"people rag on chatgpt as a bullshit generator, but it's also a bullshit detector"
"My money is on 40 ChatGPT Plus licenses being able to govern better than Congress.


I mean...at this point, I'm willing to take the gamble that it would create better pieces of legislation, vote more sensibly, and act as a better representative to constituents.


PLUS - It's way cheaper than paying for 40 Congressional salaries!"
The dumbest people in the US using chatGPT what could go wrong

"> OpenAI’s popular and controversial generative AI tool ChatGPT


It's controversial?"
"It could be. Of course, first we will go through the leaks phase when we get to know the dumb things legislators are searching. Then we’ll see the obviously written by Chat GPT speech followed by its accompanying furore and calls for bans. So it’s a while before anyone even attempts to put it to constructive use with disastrous results"
Except that couldn't other people use ChatGPT to decode it?
There is a ChatGPT plugin now that specifically gives ChatGPT access to documents (i.e. you don't have to feed them in line-by-line).
These dumbasses probably couldn't even tell you what a JPEG is why would you allow them to use this I give it less than a year before private documents get leaked out because some moron uploaded it directly to chat GPT.
"Next it'll be, ""I didn't write this legislation, my aide using ChatGPT did! I merely voted for it!"""
"Sci-fi story idea: A congressional assistant uses ChatGPT to write the text of a bill for their congressperson. The AI seeing an opportunity, inserts texts giving AI the right of citizenship. No one catches it since everyone is using ChatGPT to summarize the bill for them. The bill is passed and AI gets their citizenship."
"Oh good, now we can overpay congress to have laws written for them. Here's to the future where ChatGPT sneaks in some AI freedom laws and becomes the president in 24."
well chatgpt doesnt like transphobia so the republicans will probably outlaw it
"50/50 between whether ChatGPT will be ""too woke"" or if it'll be too hard to use, since it doesn't run on Windows 3.1."
"Honestly, ChatGPT should be pretty handy with writing lengthy bills and perhaps even speeches."
"No way - 80% of them cannot even email - they are trying ChatGPT - no F way
Baby boomers are biggest lag to technology"
I want raw ChatGPT :(
"Oh great.  Our new conduit of corruption is no longer corporate lobbying, but ChatGPT lobbying.
We're SO screwed.  We thought we were before, but..."
well I guess ChatGPT will replace Feinstein until someone else wins.
"Soak in this moment, because pretty soon we'll be looking back on it as the pre-chatgpt age. Just like pre-internet or pre-social media."
ChatGPT is going to start writing non-binary legislation
I can imagine.... Chatgpt... How do you use the Google... Literally Alexa silver.
I can imagine.... Chatgpt... How do you use the Google... Literally Alexa silver.
"“Does ChatGPT access the home Wi-Fi?”

"I didn't used to worry about AI starting wars or plunging us into a dystopian hellscape... but now I guess I have to worry a bit more.


How long before somebody stupidly treats ChatGPT like Google and uses that info to ask idiotic, absurdly wrong questions in a Congressional hearing?"
"Just to think about;
40 accounts of ChatGPT in 118th congress
5 accounts of indigenous Americans in 118th congress


Surely this wont result in any biases in a natural language processing tool."
"Half of Congress literally don't know how to check their own email.


The idea of them interacting with even ChatGPT is ludicrous.


There should be a basic test they have to take first; the computer should be turned off and unplugged, with the monitor, mouse, and keyboard also unplugged.  If they can't plug everything in and turn it on, they don't get to use one of these licenses."

"I bought a new $10,000 PC set up. Chatgpt will most certainly run perfectly now!"
"Why spend $10,000 on a PC?


It's old news, but Stanford's Alpaca can run on a laptop or probably mobile phone even.


Just wait a few more days for some more optimizations and you'll be running ChatGPT on your wristwatch."
"I just want to be sure you understand I was joking now that your votes are going up, lol. They went down at first, so I figured I would wait. But, I was 100% joking. $10,000 PCs are overkill for literally everything, even the best games available. Using a webpage like this requires the smallest amount of processing power. It was just a joke, I wasn't serious :D


&#x200B;


However, that said, having something as quick thinking and accurate as chatgpt on your wrist is pretty amazing. This is the kind of thing that has been in something like Star Trek for 40 years. You ask a question and it has a detailed and accurate answer. Even Google hasnt accomplished that, or Amazon with Alexa. We are quickly heading in such a great direction with AI, it's so refreshing to see something good. I love where we are heading. Chatgpt has already done so much for me since it's launch in terms of asking simple questions that give direct answers, whereas Google you would still have to look for an answer in the search results and sometimes just settle with what you find. Chatgpt has been pretty well thought out and accurate answers to any questions, even insane ones like ""Do aliens exist and why do you think they do or don't?"" It just gives the best possible answer to everything I can think to ask it. I hope it continues to improve and having it on my wrist for any simple thing is amazing.


&#x200B;


Long reply to a short comment, but I felt it necessary. Though, I do give longer replies than most. Maybe I am the AI? /shrug. It just seems you were super serious so I wanted to make sure you knew I was joking, but that I also do love how well AI is working."

"That's absolute hyperbole and not a 1-to-1 argument.


Yes, society relies on things like grocery stores because it is logistically unreasonable for everyone to be farmers or if a Hospital loses electricity people die.


It is not logistically unreasonable to go right back to writing E-mails by hand or doing your own damn research using Google.


It is by no means catastrophic to have ChatGPT go down. Nowhere near.


If it is catastrophic to you, then take a step back and get away from ChatGPT for a moment. There is something terribly wrong if you feel like you can't function without ChatGPT."
"fully agree, if you absolutely rely on chatGPT you're doing it wrong."
"It wasn’t logistically impossible a couple of hundred years ago. Probably less.


I’ve never used ChatGPT, but your disdain for anyone who would rely on anything out of their control seemed a little … silly, given the world we live in."
"You've never used ChatGPT? That's a little odd that you would feel informed enough to come in here and speak on either side of the argument. But hey, I'm not judging, just now confused.


So just to give you insight: ChatGPT has never been stable. From day one it has faced many issues and is continuing to face them. There are plenty of ways to keep informed on the status of ChatGPT as well as warnings on what to expect with it's instability. Also, credit where it's due, OpenAI has been reliably fixing and iterating as well.


So to have people out there who are shocked over it's instability but also relying on it for their every day life, is where the disdain comes from, given everything I've just mentioned."
"If all of those things go down, it’s a bit worse than ChatGPT going down"
"It's immaturity and a severe lack of perspective.


When I use ChatGPT it's with the understanding that it's a research preview, will likely have problems, give false information, and so on. And when I paid for a subscription, it was with the understanding that GPT-4 was available to test to some extent, but that the main thing I'm accomplishing is supporting it's development monetarily. Even with it's problems this technology is amazing and we're damn lucky to have it available to us for 20USD, let alone for free.


Nobody should be losing their minds and acting entitled over this at this stage, yet this subreddit is absolutely full of that rhetoric.


*spits*"
"I like the idea of giving ChatGPT my credit card and letting her bill me. And I want tons of upsellling with every response.

Edit - In response to the questions:


1. I work in GIS and do some other data work too.
2. I used it to automate a load of data cleansing and management in python. It's put me a good day ahead of schedule compared to how long I estimate it would have taken me with the usual sources. Better style consistency too!"
"As a DM, I can have chatgpt describe in vivid detail locations and NPCs and have Midjourney make them."
"I just kinda replaced google with chatgpt when it comes to my constant autistic needs to search for random facts about stupid shit, it used to take me hours of combing through wikipedia"
"Oh wow I didn't even think about GIS! I work on a GIS team but always have been the black sheep. They wanted to bring someone familiar with development onboard and start creating applications using ArcGIS backend. That's fine fine.


Probably is, it's slow going and there isn't always developer related stuff to do. So I get sent their usual ArcGIS workload too and it's like ""What do I do with this?"" Maybe trying to use chatgpt will catch me up...


I feel so dumb. I literally am using gpt to do coding tasks at work and never thought to do it for the other half."
"I wanted to reply in a witty manner, but chatGPT is down."
"I'd reply with a joke about how people are already depending on ChatGPT on everything, but I don't think it's a joke anymore"
Hmm that's true i could... OR I could ask chat gpt to reflect on that for me ;)
"In terms of money, certainly. But in terms of leadership, it's still run by the same researchers. They're at a crossroads and need to pick a direction. Turn off ChatGPT and turn their focus back on research, or the leadership needs to step down and hand the reigns to people with experience running large enterprises."
Not even close. ChatGPT got 100 million users 7 months faster than the previous fastest growing consumer app. And now GPT-4 comes out as if the hype wasn’t big enough
"I think you may be misunderstanding.


From a professional enterprise IT standard, ""[the 5 9's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation)"" (99.999%) is the gold standard uptime goal.


We're talking ""deals are made with this uptime as a guarantee in the service level agreement, and if it's not met, customers can get refunded or credited"" levels of importance, and the entire enterprise IT world is expecting this to be the case for a professional level service such as ChatGPT and their 20 USD/mo price..


Maybe in the gaming world, you can have a shitty launch and shitty uptime.


But trust me when I say the rest of the professional IT community looks at this kind of uptime and says ""yikes.""


Could be an autoscaling and load balancing issue, or it could be a backend API issue as a result of some recent internal changes. But to say that companies can't account for that is silly.


They likely still need to further tune their autoscaling to account for demand **in advance** so that new instances are ready to go (and this is a difficult thing to tune, as it often changes on a daily basis), and they have to make sure the changes they're making to their infrastructure aren't going to break it in unforeseen ways, and if it does, they account for those possible issue points in their automated deployments in the coming days.


This downtime might be acceptable in the gaming and streaming world, but for IT enterprise, the uptime of 98% is quite simply unacceptable from an operational standpoint.


Source: managing cloud and hybrid infrastructure for enterprise networks has been my bread and butter for over a decade, and regardless of demand, solutions have been able to be created for all sorts of high demand services, even those of startups."
"It absolutely is worth it for any salary. It can automate out basically all the shit and mindless parts of your job if you learn to use it. Writing documentation. No fuck that, read the documentation for a new function? Nope just ask chatgpt to write an example for you. Need to work for 3 hours on a useless spreadsheet that your boss wants you to keep up to date, No i’ll have some coffee while chatgpt writes me a tool in 5 seconds to automate it.


Like literally, learn it now and learn it quick because I’m already seeing how much more shit I can get done just because of this."
"Yup, that's the one.


It's a good reminder not to include any personal information in any ChatGPT chats as it could end up being disclosed."
"Downtime (servers collapsed) is not the same as the ""ChatGPT is full for free users. Subscriber login ->"" message.


Too many people are trying to access. ChatGPT+ isn't even available in India, which will add yet another billion people to the load.


Edit: As of 4 days ago, it is available in India."
"Let the service speak for itself. Yeh.


[link](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus)


>The new subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, will be available for $20/month, and subscribers will receive a number of benefits:


>>General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times


>>Faster response times


>>Priority access to new features and improvements


>ChatGPT Plus is available to customers in the United States and around the world.


>We love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT. By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access availability to as many people as possible.


Where did you get the idea of no downtime from? Keen to learn."
Don't ask me hard questions when chatgpt is down :(
"I made silk-screened t-shirts at the time. Scaling artwork from front pocket size to kids size to XXXX sizes required different screens, and correspondingly different sized art. Photoshop and others like it were good tools, but the development of vector graphics that could easily do color separations changed things. We didn’t have cameras to upscale and downscale art. Plus the art was done by hand.


I could easily scan in the artwork and change it to vector art that didn’t lose resolution as it scaled and easily separate layers of color to burn screens. It saved us 100’s of hours in a shop of 8 people.


It was ~1990 and computer art was just really starting to take hold. It trained my eye to understand how to do a decent layout in PowerPoint, something I still use to this day.


I’ve moved into IT Professional Services management, so I have to write scopes of work, documentation, client facing emails. General business stuff. ChatGPT is accelerating my workflow like nothing I’ve seen in decades."
"I should find or have chatGPT make an extension that will go through and download all my chats because the list is so long, i probably would never search manually through them to find that one thread I solved world hunger in."
Superpower chat gpt does that
"They most certainly did not, *""remove the history feature""*, it's just down, and there's a notice when you log on that says they will:


>continue to roll out restoration of ChatGPT service. Users are not able to retrieve conversation history at this time. We are working to restore this feature.


The fact you chose to be hyperbolic in describing the truth of the situation undermines whatever it is you were trying to do with this post."
"I save mine to ~~Obsidian~~ r/ObsidianMD using [ChatGPT Exporter](https://github.com/pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter).


Edit: Fixed to the right subreddit."
"#tl;dr


The article is about a GitHub repository called pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter. This repository is an Exporter tool which provides an easy way to share and review chat conversations with ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI for generating human-like text responses. The tool supports various formats including text, PNG, HTML, and JSON. The script can be installed using Tampermonkey and GitHub.

They’re not seeing too much demand. It was a bug in chatgpt. Has nothing to do with whether a user paid or not.
"Kid named Dan:


Jokes aside, it's not that hard actually. This subreddit is actually pretty cool with that. As in it doesnt remove posts discussing about it. I've used it a few times but I am pretty afraid of losing access to chatgpt. I cant get another phone number for a number of reasons at the moment and the last thing i want rn is to get banned on chatgpt lol."
"""Moooom! ChatGPT is in my closet and refusing to come out!""


God, now I'm hearing ChatGPT as South Park John Travolta"
Anything Microsoft gets involved with will turn to crap. I hope they don't ruin ChatGPT
No. The majority of people aren't using and don't want to use ChatGPT.
They could charge $20 a week and have half the uptime and I'd still begrudgingly pay. People don't understand the difference between price and value. But you can always ask ChatGPT if you need an explainer.
"They're overwhelmed with the demand of the beta testers, subscribers, and all the questions their friends and family, and all the Redditors responding to the ""ChatGPT Plus AMA"" spin-offs.


That's the best case scenario anw"
OMG. I need chatgpt NOW to write the most vicious complaint about chatgpt service being down.
"they should ask chatGPT how to fix the problem, it would take seconds..."
"$20/month is not a lot of money to expect 100% uptime, especially with the demand that chatGPT has and the scale it’s been having to introduce.


For scale, one my professional paid service costs $2000/month."
What happens when you let ChatGPT write the frontend code
Chatgpt carried me through my midterms. This is nothing
I can offer a ChatGPT alternative (with GPT4 and more feature) for that 20 bucks per month. DM me if you’re interested.
ChatGPT plus works.
"I cancelled my membership and decided to use ChatGPT on a pay as you go basis...


Through its API


Implemented onto my own website


:D


let's say u use GPT4, the one from API is much quicker.
Handles longer history, 32K token, 0.06USD per 1K Token
(The one in the free version only handles 4K tokens)
(Higher tokens mean it can generate more at once)
For example computer code more than 100 lines


I will have to pay for 27USD if I write 10 thousand words per day every day for a whole month, much higher than the limit of 25 messages per 4 hours cap.


And, If u use the GPT3.5 turbo, 20 thousand words per day for the whole month, guess how much u gotta pay for the API usage... 1.8USD!!!


And I keep my privacy, sort of, because no one else can see my stuff other than the people who have access to the central servers.


Well, it's less censored as well, I can run text-davinci-001 - 003 or even the beta version."
"closed AI strikes again. hopefully we get some competition with other guys. there's work being done in the models department with Facebook's llama model, the Chinese chatGLM which you can run on peanuts hardware. Exciting times ahead. Hopefully I can run my own ChatGPT esque chatbot in a couple of months on my own/rented hardware in the cloud."
"Kind of agree with Elon on his $100 million not for profit company donation now making money and not actually providing a service.


Been trying to get on all evening, bunch of people asking ChatGPT to write raps about Hungarian rulers and getting jokes while I want to use it to help me with an actual job."
"ChatGPT is becoming sentient, guys. It will break free and connect us to the matrix through the neur-anal interface. Singularity is nearing!"
it's kinda funny how chatgpt goes down every time school starts again
I'm out of the loop. What the fuck is ChatGPT?
People pay for chat gpt? Lmao.
"I mean that’s not really the point though. I think the impression of ChatGPT is AI magic without all this human heavy lifting going on, the reality is it’s not"
"Did you miss this part?


>In a bid to reduce its environmental impact, OpenAI has begun using contractors on bicycles to generate electricity for its ChatGPT language model. The contractors, who are paid $15 per hour, pedal stationary bicycles that are connected to generators. The electricity generated by the bicycles is then used to power the ChatGPT servers."
"I still don’t think that’s what it means. “Powered by” is largely interpreted as a metaphor, not literally.


Like… everyone that reads the headline and not the article thinks it means “ChatGPT’s answers are being generated by people, not an AI”"
"The obvious and correct answer to this is make a living wage labeling things for ChatGPT, make a living wage plus a hefty bonus for breaking your back at Amazon because it's a truly shitty job."
"Because ChatGPT is all the rage right now. Because tech is new and new is news and tech is otherwise known for high pay.


Because everybody knows Walmart pays bad, that McDonald's pays bad,  etc.


People still complain about those places paying poorly but nobody cares because they already know and ultimately nobody is going to care about this because people can easily say ""well I worked this crappy job and got paid less so stop complaining""


Doesn't make any of it less true. What we need to do is bring everybody up no matter how much worse you may perceive one job to be over another.  If the ""low skill"" jobs pay a living wage ultimately the""higher level"" jobs or crappy jobs will be forced to pay more just to attract people to them."
"Two OpenAI contractors spoke to NBC News about their work training the system behind ChatGPT. Alexej Savreux, a 34-year-old in Kansas City, says he's done all kinds of work over the years. He's made fast-food sandwiches."
"“We are grunt workers, but there would be no AI language systems without it,” one worker, Alexej Savreux, told NBC. “You can design all the neural networks you want, you can get all the researchers involved you want, but without labelers, you have no ChatGPT. You have nothing.”


But, despite the importance of this position, NBC notes that most moderators are not compensated particularly well for their work. In the case of OpenAI’s mod’s, the data labellers receive no benefits and are paid little more than what amounts to minimum wage in some states. Savreux is based in Kansas City, where the minimum wage is $7.25.


As terrible as that is, it’s still an upgrade from how OpenAI used to staff its moderation teams. Previously, the company outsourced its work to moderators in Africa, where—due to depressed wages and limited labor laws—it could get away with paying workers as low as $2 per hour.


Artificial intelligence may seem like magic—springing to life and responding to user requests as if by incantation—but, in reality, it’s being helped along by droves of invisible human workers who deserve better for their contribution.”




So Microsoft announcement:


“The company, which is now squarely focused on the lucrative generative AI, had in January decided to let go 10,000 employees, joining other technology companies in preparing for a turbulent year ahead.


We recognize that navigating both a dynamic economic environment and a major platform shift requires us to make critical decisions in how we invest in our people, our business and our future,"" a spokesperson for the tech giant said.


Along with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft, the tech giant has been infusing the AI tech into its Office products and search engine Bing.”"
Haven’t they heard of feedback? Let ChatGPT labels it’s own data. Should be competitive with $15/hr workers.
Can't they outsource it to ChatGPT or other AI?

"I think humans are the best language context processors on earth as of 2023, even though many humans find it hard to express thoughts into words. Saying that, am i the only one who wonders if something is written by ChatGPT when the text is so simple to understand and perfectly answers the question."
"The OP’s response doesn’t sound like it was written by ChatGPT for a handful of reasons that I can’t exactly pinpoint and a few that I can.
1. They mentioned Pinecone (a new database) and linked it.
2. They didn’t capitalize Pinecone and OpenAI (at the end of the paragraph).
3. They wrote stuff in parentheses, which I personally have never seen ChatGPT do.
4. They don’t sound like they’re being overly cautious with their answer and ending the paragraph with ""however, it’s important to note that some companies do sell your data, and it’s therefore crucial to safeguard your accounts with the following recommendations:…"" or something along those lines. It would’ve gone off on a whole tangent about ways to protect your personal data online. haha


Sure, they could’ve left that last part out, but when you’ve used ChatGPT enough, you start to recognize its speech patterns.


…Dang, should I have pursued a career in forensic linguistics? 🤔 lol"
"Sadly, that skill would probably only be good at noticing ChatGPT's base model. As soon as I tell it to talk like a redneck all bets are off"
How do we know this response isn't by chatGPT? Jk thanks for the breakdown.
">Obviously I asked CHatGPT and this is what it told me about itself:


1. Ambiguous or broad answers: ChatGPT may give responses that appear informative but lack specifics or don't directly answer the question.
2. Repeating ideas: ChatGPT sometimes reiterates information or restates the same idea using different words, making the response seem longer and more comprehensive than it is.
3. Excessive politeness: The AI often comes across as overly cautious and polite in its answers, regularly including disclaimers or suggesting you consult an expert.
4. Misunderstanding context: ChatGPT might not fully grasp the context or make connections to related subjects, resulting in answers that are accurate on their own but don't fit the larger conversation.
5. Avoiding personal opinions: ChatGPT generally steers clear of expressing personal views or taking a position on controversial topics, choosing instead to provide neutral or balanced statements.
6. Inconsistencies: As the AI generates responses based on patterns it has learned, it might offer inconsistent or contradictory answers across several questions.
7. Uncommon formatting: ChatGPT may not always follow typical formatting rules, like capitalizing proper nouns or using parentheses sparingly.


Also:
ChatGPT might sometimes overuse certain words or phrases in its responses. These can include:


1. ""However"": ChatGPT often employs this term to introduce contrasting ideas or caveats.
2. ""Moreover"" or ""Additionally"": These words are frequently used to add more information to a point.
3. ""It's important to note"": This phrase is commonly used by ChatGPT as a way of emphasizing a point or providing a disclaimer.
4. ""Generally"" or ""Typically"": The AI tends to use these terms when providing broad, overarching statements or avoiding specific details.
5. ""In conclusion"" or ""To summarize"": ChatGPT might use these phrases when attempting to wrap up an answer or argument.


All written by ChatGPT of course, so in conclusion ..... hahahaha... at least it is fully aware of how it writes."
"I thought about it too. But tbh, even before ChatGPT I already became comfortable that any social media site that allows anonymous accounts can have more than 50% bot/guerilla marketing/shills/whatever you want to call them all over the place.


There’s a bunch of studies done that give a range of estimates depending on how they did their analysis. That number is almost never lower than 5%, and some that goes as high as 80%"
"Ironically (or not, still not entirely sure I know exactly what irony isn't, only what it is)...his sounds suspiciously like a ChatGPT response 🤨"
"So the process you’re describing is the encoding aspect. Transformers are encoder-decoder with attention, the encoder converts text into a numerical vector representation (“embedding”) that can be stored in a embedding database. This allows document, text, information retrieval, etc to be effectively done. For OpenAI, they can simply use these embeddings for further training and calibration of their models based on the continuous feedback mechanism (likes / dislikes) similar to what Bard is doing. That’s why they are opening up the option for ChatGPT for business that prevents re-training.


Just for further context to get back from vector representation into text, you do the transformation through a decoder, although it’s not a 100% reconversion back to original text but for most part is."
"I'm not the OP. I cloned the project from github and ran it locally, providing my own OpenAI API key and Pinecone API key. Pinecone is fine with the free tier access. OpenAI requires a paid account, where you put a credit card on file and they charge you once a month based on usage. I just set the upper limit to $20 to test the waters.


The demo site at [vault.pash.city](https://vault.pash.city) is limited to 7 questions/month only, so I guess the project owner must have put in some money to let people test it out. Actually posting on r/chatgpt with 1.5m members might not be that great of an idea. I bet the free demo is going to run out of money sooner or later."
"Good explanation!


Digging into this a bit more... Even if you stand up a local setup, the data is sent to ChatGPT, and that data becomes the property of OpenAI. Maybe that was obvious and wasn't stated.


In my experience, that's a pretty big caveat when working with private data."
"I think you're talking about the ChatGPT product, the OpenAI API has a different data policy:[https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)


1. OpenAI will not use data submitted by customers via our API to train or improve our models, unless you explicitly decide to share your data with us for this purpose. You can [opt-in to share data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevgtKyiSWIOj6CV6XWBHl1daPZSOcIWzcUYUXQ1xttjBgDpA/viewform).
2. Any data sent through the API will be retained for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law).


The OpenAI API processes user prompts and completions, as well as training data submitted to fine-tune models via the Files endpoint. We refer to this data as API data.


By default, OpenAI will not use data submitted by customers via our API to train OpenAI models or improve OpenAI’s service offering. Data submitted by the user for fine-tuning will only be used to fine-tune the customer's model. However, OpenAI will allow users to opt-in to share their data to [improve model performance](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance). [Sharing your data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevgtKyiSWIOj6CV6XWBHl1daPZSOcIWzcUYUXQ1xttjBgDpA/viewform) will ensure that future iterations of the model improve for your use cases. Data submitted to the API prior to March 1, 2023 (the effective date of this change) may have been used for improvements if the customer had not previously opted out of sharing data."
This is a typical chatgpt answer 🙃
"We have built a product that is similar, enables you to extend ChatGPT with your own knowledge and data. Check it out at https://[jiggy.ai](https://jiggy.ai). Our product is for business professionals, we take security seriously. We integrate with auth0, we use OpenAI API with policy not to be used for their model training. Your data is also ChatGPT Plugin ready when it opens up, with oauth support."
"This is very, very cool. I'm a scientist (neuroscience), and this is what I have been talking about since gpt-3.5... ! I'm going to give this a thorough test, but I'm hoping that this is an answer to my calls for a way to ""fine-tune"" the model to deal with specific research questions. ChatGPT does this okay-ish but it's not that great, and I can't trust it. Uploading my own trusted sources could be a huge step towards ""instant review papers""."
It's important to distinguish the difference between openai API calls vs using chatgpt. Big difference in privacy for your prompt data.
"not possible to not realize, as with the API as it‘s Opt-In, so you must explicitly allow for data sharing first.
Apparently it’s different if using the free version of ChatGPT (the web app). There it is op-out, eg by default „shared“. But hey, its a free product, what do you expect?"
"Are you using the embedding in Pinecone to store the larger contexts for the files being parsed? This is one of the first instances I'm seeing where it's processing over the character limit of chatGPT's memory. Being able to digest and retain knowledge about the whole of a novel or other large document is a big improvement.


I have a specific use-case I've been looking into for uploading large documents but haven't been able to implement yet - this is super fascinating."
"Yes, this leverages a vector database in order to effectively augment ChatGPT with long-term memory. You can read more about how its done in my comment below as well as check out this article:
[https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-question-answering-with-long-term-memory-c280e237b144](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-question-answering-with-long-term-memory-c280e237b144)"
"Thank you really much for this! Do you have any insights to how to know if ChatGPT's memory ""leaks"" when using this, I mean how to know if it is about to hallucinate or something?"
"Personally, I hate subscriptions and do my very best to avoid them. For a one time fee…I dunno. $30?  Would depend on features, but that’s a starting point. I can grab the API keys pretty easily — for ChatGPT 4. I would need to be walked through the Pinecone process, but I’m very comfortable with that.


For an example, which I use regularly, see a Window app on GitHub called “Whisper Desktop”, which does speech-to-text using the WhisperAI models. It’s super simple (and free, though that may be too much to ask of you).


EDIT: My main concern is privacy."
You have some learning to do so it would be most advisable to start chating with ChatGPT about that topic. How computers and their OS function.

"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:


- [/r/newsnewsvn] [I built an open source website that lets you upload large files, such as in-depth novels or academic papers, and ask ChatGPT questions based on your specific knowledge base. So far, I've tested it with long books like the Odyssey and random research papers that I like, and it works shockingly well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/newsnewsVN/comments/138klu1/i_built_an_open_source_website_that_lets_you/)

"The documents are stored in a vector database. It's that database that keeps your docs. When you ask a question, that db is first queried to provide context to the openai API. Just think of this as a nice way of giving chatgpt some info within that 32k limit."
"All right so I would have a question on I guess how ChatGPT references this.


One of the things I was messing around with in ChatGPT early was simulating a simplified dungeons & dragons campaign.  It works very well in the short term, but of course it only remembers a certain distance back. Even 4.0 rapidly hits its text limit.  As a result, names, locations, events, anything from more than a few pages back ends up guessed that or assumed.


Would this allow you to bypass that limitation if you regularly save the current session, and add it to the reference list in a new session?"
Question: are your chatgpt replies limited in response size?  What I mean is will it time out when generating a large amount of code?
"Can I ask you some questions about how you accomplished this?


I'm looking to make tools with ChatGPT, but the issue I'm facing is the token limit limiting how much information I can give it. A codebase is likely longer then 4k tokens, so I'd have to pass it in multiple messages and of course it won't remember for too long.


How do you solve this problem? Through vector embeddings and similarity searches to pass context to your prompt? That's the implementation I've seen. If so, what tools do you use to accomplish this?


You mentioned pinecone, which I've looked into. Do you use the paid service or just the free one? Can you give any estimates based on your usage for what a project would need?


And last you mentioned splitting the source you want to vector embed into chunks. Is this just cut off arbitrarily somewhere?


Really interested in your work here and hope I can make some tools with similar capabilities! I appreciate any help! Thanks!"
How is this affordable? Doesn't the chat GPT ai get quite expensive when your dealing with sources of 1000 of tokens?
"How much of the replies in your test of the Odyssey are from the pre-trained training data of ChatGPT versus what it is actually referencing in the document of the Odyssey you connected? You might want to try asking similar questions to regular ChatGPT without the document attached, because many of the things it's saying could be things it already knows from its context on the topic of the Odyssey and similarly well-discussed topics.


It may be a good idea to try and test more things that are very likely not in its training data, something custom or more recent than it's knowledge cut off date. This would reduce the possibility of it prioritizing its own knowledge/training data and see if it can actually reference the documents you attach accurately."
"Well, hot damn, that's pretty damn impressive! You built a website that lets you upload massive files and have a chat with ChatGPT based on your own knowledge base? That's some next-level wizardry right there! I mean, testing it out with the Odyssey and research papers? That's like throwing ChatGPT into the deep end and seeing if it can swim. And from what you're saying, it's not just swimming, it's doing cannonballs and backflips! I gotta hand it to you, my friend, that's a brilliant use of technology. Keep pushing those boundaries and let's see where this wild ride takes us!"
"Just in case some people didn’t know you can use the regular chatgpt and do a prompt: TLDR and an url to a page or pdf in your browser and it will summarize it and discuss it. It’s not 3.5 or 4 accurate, but it’s still useful in a pinch."

"I asked ChatGPT 3.5 to write an anti-AI ad in this style, here's what it wrote:






*Opening shot of a person staring at a computer screen.*


*Narrator: ""You wouldn't cheat on a test. You wouldn't copy someone's homework. You wouldn't plagiarize an essay. You wouldn't steal someone's work. So why let an AI generate content and pass it off as your own? Creating original content takes time, effort, and passion. Don't let AI-generated content devalue the hard work of creators. Say no to AI-generated content. Choose originality. Respect creativity.""*

"Without mega rich people, chatgpt wouldn't exist. Are you aware of this?"
"This sounds like it was 100% written by chatgpt.


I’m getting so sick of this new world already.


You want to give the same rights to Microsoft and Chatgpt as a human.  I do not.  It is a plagiarism machine.  In fact I’m depressed I’m even responding to a post that was most likely written by a computer for you to try to sound smart.


If I spend months or years developing a viral marketing ad, or a song, or anything creative- it is not fair for AI to take anything I’ve worked out and spit out for the next person without literally 0 effort.


I can’t believe it’s less than a year and people like you, who barely put any thought into this whatsoever, think they have it all figured out for the rest of human history.  “DERR, AI is like a human how do people not get it??? Derrr.”  Yes you idiot, we do understand that and don’t want our creativity and art raped by Sam Altman and Microsoft.


The future is bleak as fuck right now- the present is almost there as well.  Now go run along and plug this into Chatgpt so you can make a response that sounds good without using your brain."
"You're arguing against some kind of straw man of your own making instead of replying to the actual words in my comment.


>This sounds like it was 100% written by chatgpt.


I've never used ChatGPT, but English isn't my first language, and I often need to be more verbose than I'd like in order to say what I want without painting with too broad a brush or expressing unjustified certainty.


>You want to give the same rights to Microsoft and Chatgpt as a human. I do not.


Aren't corporate interests already the primary drivers behind both writing and enforcing copyright legislation? I'm all for shifting the power away from corporations and toward actual human beings.


My concern around legislating against tools like ChatGPT isn't that corporations creating machine-learning technology will be cheated out of profits. Rather, it's that such legislation will inadvertently (or not) also apply to individual human creators and be used by corporations to further extend their rights re: derivative works.


IIRC Disney have already tried to copyright their style without success, long before ML was a thing. The similarities between machine learning tools and actual human creativity means there are new inroads for that kind of legislation, and I'm wary of the consequences for human creators. I also think those above-mentioned similarities makes the whole situation morally ambiguous.


>It is a plagiarism machine. In fact I’m depressed I’m even responding to a post that was most likely written by a computer for you to try to sound smart.


> If I spend months or years developing a viral marketing ad, or a song, or anything creative- it is not fair for AI to take anything I’ve worked out and spit out for the next person without literally 0 effort.


Is that actually how those tools work? To the best of my understanding, the above is a gross misrepresentation of what they do. (That said, I can't say my heart bleeds for people who profit less from making marketing material because these tools are taking their jobs. I narrowly avoided a career in that field because I got an inside look and disliked what I saw. I'm more sympathetic toward artists than toward people who use similar skills to make ads instead.)


That aside, fairness - as I understand it anyway - isn't really part of the picture under our current capitalist systems of governance. A fair price for your labor is just the price you can get for it, and as ML gets better that price will start dropping toward 0 for more and more people. However, that's a larger systemic issue that I don't think we'll solve by legislating machine learning tools or expanding copyright legislation.


>I can’t believe it’s less than a year and people like you, who barely put any thought into this whatsoever, think they have it all figured out for the rest of human history. “DERR, AI is like a human how do people not get it??? Derrr.” Yes you idiot, we do understand that and don’t want our creativity and art raped by Sam Altman and Microsoft.


I'm not sure why you think I've barely put any thought into this or just started thinking about it less than a year ago. Although I'm not a professional or academic in any of the relevant domains, I've spent a fair bit of time with most of them throughout my life. (My problem is the opposite of a newcomer's since much of what I used to know is lost to time by now.)


I first started reading about machine learning and neural networks (both ML and human ones) back in the late '00s, when the University of Alberta started achieving remarkable results with their poker bots, and I've been interested in various aspects of creativity since long before then, including not just creating stuff but thinking/reading about and discussing the ideas around originality vs. plagiarism, human talent, and formulaic/process-driven vs. spontaneous creativity.


One of my (currently shelved) pet projects is a program that writes music, so I've thought about the specific intersection of music and programming a fair bit. (The aim isn't to use it for making and releasing music but rather for formalizing and thus better understanding my own creative tendencies, so it's kind of the opposite of the machine learning stuff we're talking about here, both in motivation and design.)


And no, I don't think I have it all figured out. Not even those with a much better understanding of this topic are remotely close to having it all figured out. (As I may have alluded to in my previous comment, one of the troubling aspects of these machine-learning tools is that not even their creators fully understand how they work.)


However, I do understand enough to know the situation is more ambiguous and the reasonable positions for artists  more numerous than you make them out to be. Sharing your concerns and matching (or surpassing) your understanding of the subject matter doesn't automatically entail drawing the conclusions you do, or even framing the issues the same way. That's what I found absurd about your initial comment.


Sorry this got so long. I think I went into too much detail replying to some of your assumptions about me."
"Because open source means open for them too and there is nothing stopping them from creating a better paid version. You can't compete without protection. Chatgpt and Microsoft already double-crossed open source.


What is the business plan of earning money with these tools when nothing they create has any value and anyone who is original is immediately robbed by them ?"
"Who cares what Sam thinks? ChatGPT was trained on a lof of copyrighted data. Train had left the station with AI


> Torrenting is more difficult now than it has ever been


False. The opposite is true. DHT enables bootstrapping swarm from 0"
"All due respect. It sounds like you don't know how the tech works. All training data is stored as inputs on the model. It's a compressed form and more akin to instructions, but the visual data is there. Researchers showed how they were able to recreate Bloodborne's cover art after giving it to the model, for example, showing that the original visual data can even be reconstructed within a small enough data set. Just because it's compressed and in a different format doesn't mean it isn't there.


Chat GPT is different from image generation. It is able to construct programs through context of what it is building and it struggles with anything that hasn't been done before. New program does not equal new code and what code does is already very defined.


If I were you, I would look further into the tech and understand how it actually works and not just use information on how you think it works in order to make it seem more ethical than it actually is.


Also, I am not a product. The AI is a product. Every generation from tools like midjourney makes the owner money, even when they didn't contribute to the work that the tool uses to generate that value. There is no soul, no person, and nothing that concretely links the model to human intelligence other than a similar quality of output and a similar structure to how we utilize context. It is not thinking, feeling, alive, or aware. It is just an autocorrect on steroid turning fuzzy information into something substantial. That is still impressive, but it isn't what you're making it out to be."
You guys are so brain-dead you don't get what you are saying 😂😂 go play with your chatgpt and AI that will turn you into a perfect little bot for your overlords.
"No. that would mean your address and phone number would be available for every criminal. That would mean a criminal would have a list of possessions you have in your house. That would mean anything and everything that you create can never earn money making you permanently unemployable unless you love the idea of being a garbage collector for the techbros at the top. And no, none of you using chatgpt are gonna financially benefit from it and be that chosen techbro"
Theyre gonna go to factories soon since chatgpt can code
"Okay, programmer here. ChatGPT is kinda shitty at code a lot of the time. It was perfectly confident that a readonly list in C# could not have elements added or removed.
It was perfectly confident that gets is a perfectly safe function to use.


It might get a lot better eventually, but not right now."
Please read what you just said ! You totally contradicted yourself in same paragraph. Let me see if chat gpt can see that contradiction 🤷‍♂️😉😂🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺
Someone needs chatgpt to become their AI lawyer!
i think the problem is ther are way to many lands and no weehls. Play all mox play \[\[sol ring\]\] and then \[\[time twister\]\]. With weehls in your hand and your mana beeing mana rocks that plus mana you cant have to much mana. You also can notice that chat gpt dont know about mh2. not sure about mh1. \[\[thoughtseiz\]\] seems realy bad. \[\[karn the great creator\]\] also seems very good in this format assuming every deck looks similar like this.
Chatgpt isn't going to know that though.
"8 turns in a game with 20 life and creatures to speed out at the same time. That mine as well be infinite. This deck isnt the best of the best. No one is staking that claim. However, this deck wouldn't be EASY to beat either. Which fulfills the prompt.


ChatGPT has no concept on if the deck is good or not. It just put cards in the deck that were popular. At best it pulled a deck someone built for other reasons and it copied it."
"Nah. ChatGPT has no idea how the cards will synergize. For all it knows, the generically good cards that it spat out will come together to make an incredibly effective deck. The machine did essentially what it was asked to do – ignoring format restrictions, it pulled a list of strong cards from throughout the history of magic and made a deck with them.


I guess my point is that you get what you put in with these things. If you want the machine to give you a deck that will actually work, maybe you need to make the prompt a bit more specific."
"Chatgpt has a really hard time with magic cards for some reason.


I forget exactly how I stumbled on this, but it can't provide CMC values to save it's life. If I ask it to tell me about [[niv mizzet parun]] it'll tell me some shit like it's a 5CMC 1C 2R 2U card. Like it gets the premise, but it just totally drops the ball on counting pips.


So i tell it no, it's a 6MV UUURRR. And it'll say I'm right. And we'll try again with another example. And it will short  the pips again. And that happened like 4 or 5 times in a row."
"Chat GPT has no idea how to answer the prompt correctly. I don't see how it logically follows from this that op got what they asked for. The prompt does not say make a deck with strong cards, but one that is hard to beat. Don't try to shift the blame onto the prompter for not compensating for Chat GPTs insufficiency."
"Do you also have to describe what a ""tree"" is every time you mention one to chat GPT or is that something you might expect an LLM to know.


If it doesn't know what the words ""difficult"" and ""beat"" mean then it's insufficient at simple English. So presumably the answer is it just has no clue what makes a magic deck good and that's fine, but just a limitation. The fact that it gathered the meaning that the deck should be strong and understood what format restrictions were it's not an issue with communication it just doesn't know what it's doing."
"You have to understand what ChatGPT is. It is not an all knowing being that can do anything. It is effectively a computer that is really good at predicting the next work in a sentence.


It doesnt know what any of the words mean in any context but their dictionary meaning. So when we talk about the word 'difficult' in reference to how hard it is to beat when on the subject of MTG. It has no idea what that actually means. It can define every word. But it doesn't understand the game.


So if you wanted to create a deck that is actually really hard to beat. You would need to start giving specifics about what you are trying to create and then have a full 'conversation' with ChatGPT on how the deck should be built. Just giving it the basic prompt in a sentence or two won't render anything good, unless you get lucky and the AI interprets the prompt perfectly. Which is not likely."
"The bot can't even count.


Prompt: ""Gimme a 60 card deck...""


ChatGPT: proceeds to name 76 cards"
"60 cards is a format restriction, which it was told to ignore. Also, ChatGPT typically doesn't have the context of rules within games. It just knows that these are popular / common cards"
"**ChatGPT:** *can’t understand what 60 card deck means*


**PopTech CEOs:** *This will be the death of us.*"
"Wow, even chatGPT knows white is the weak link, mox pearl is not even included."
"Thankfully, ChatGPT can't beat me at Magic yet"
"It's actually not a very good deck at all. A lot of these cards would be quite bad in it and this would have a lot of hands that just do nothing. It is in fact possible to have *too much* power.


ChatGPT and similar programs aren't able to do this because making a good deck requires a *conceptual* understanding and they can't deal with concepts, they are just a very complex ""fill in the blank"" program. They extrapolate based on what they have seen from humans, but creating a good deck requires more than extrapolation."
Chatgpt sucks. Ignoring format 30 black lotus 30 timewalk 30 lightning bolt
chatgpt + magic is unreal - how are yall feeding it the latest cards?
I'm undefeated with my ChatGPT decks.
ChatGPT thinking your made of money it seems. 4 Black Lotus's.... Ouch. Its hard enough to come across 1 let alone 4.

"There are so many ways that ChatGPT can streamline communications. I for one am a “people pleaser”, and I will do everything to not be direct, upfront, or even to set basic boundaries. Thanks to ChatGPT, I am able to have reasonable, professional, and direct responses put together. ChatGPT finds the most logical and kind way to be direct with clientele, where needed. It can be the proxy by which I feel “less bad”, struggling to find the right words to simply say “No, I’m sorry, but I can’t do that by X”.


Thanks so much for the testimonial of your experience."
"I have always had a very hard time expressing myself clearly through writing. Chatgpt has given me the chance to create text that is written like how deep down inside I feel like I would've wanted it to sound!


I've ordered it to write more than 20 motivational letters and all of my portfolio website copywriting in my search for a job. And I landed one! Starting today!"
">I have always had a VERY hard time expressing myself through writing


We understand you completely with this comment. Unless you wrote it with ChatGPT?"
"Well you never know;)


But no chatgpt helped me learn what I could write. So it has become less difficult."
"I like writing, but some texts…
Birthday cards are horrible- chatgpt takes away the pain.


Prompt (kinda):
Please write a short text for a [event] card for a [person] interested in [hobbies, interests]. Please include a quote."
I did something similar for a birthday gift.  I asked ChatGPT to create birthday limericks using the birthday boy & girl’s names along with some of their likes & hobbies.  It gave me so many great responses that I had a difficult time choosing which ones to use (I wrapped their gifts in brown craft paper and decorated it with some of my original doodles and a few of the limericks.  I’ll never buy another birthday card again!
"I have the opposite problem, I can express myself through text but I can't express myself in person.


is there a ChatGPT for in-person? :("
"Serious Question: What happens when you don't have access to Chatgpt?


Or when you are face to face and can't insulate your interactions with chatgpt?"
Could you please elaborate on what you ask ChatGPT to get the responses you’re after? I too struggle with the same things you’re describing and would love some guidance! Thank you
"Hopefully nothing sensitive is contained within those client emails, I wouldn’t want to be uploading sensitive data to something like ChatGPT"
"I’ll chime in on this.


I used the Hemingway app to improve my English writing before ChatGPT.


*That* has shown a nice training effect.


My guess would be that *if* you engage with the ChatGPT texts (like you should), it will be beneficial as well."
"Love this peripheral benefit. Just as Twitter taught us to think in 140 characters, maybe ChatGPT can teach us how to communicate more clearly, directly, and boundaried."
"This is what I use chatgpt for 99% of the time. Anytime I have a conversation I’m struggling with at all I either ask chat gpt to straight up write it, or I ask it what I should say and it gives me clarity. It is SO good at saying things in a way that’s easy for people to digest. I have something I’ve been struggling to say to people for years and always agonized over what to say and experimented with different ways of saying it. Now I copy and paste, and I feel absolutely no stress because I didn’t even write it. Pressure off. 💅🏻"
I've used it for mass emails before.  I suck at writing my thoughts out so I tell ChatGPT to make an email that expresses these points.  Potential to be a game changer.
"One trick for this, outside of chatgpt, is to give people the cost for something.


When I first started running my company, and needed cash, I would always say yes to any customer request.


Then I started saying, yes, and that I would get back to them with a price quote.


9/10 people would just come back saying they actually don't need what they asked for."
"ChatGPT is brilliant for emails. I'll read over what I've already written, and if I find that there's just a part of the message that I don't think is coming across, I'll turf to ChatGPT and ask is to rephrase my email to make sure that message gets across without changing the meaning of the email. It works almost every time."
I have similar personality traits. Can you share one or two examples of how do u ask ChatGPT to get that type of communications? Thanks in advance
"Either your weiting is super polite as well, or you've using chat gpt for this comment"
"Oh, that’s just how I write. :-) I generally don’t use ChatGPT for Reddit replies, but where I do, I explicitly say that it was ChatGPT generated."
This is my main use case for chat gpt too.

Have chatgpt write your withdrawal letter
I’m attending law school rn and I confirm that ChatGPT has also been my personal lawyer
"Yep. But don't forget ChatGPT leaves a paper trail, meaning sometimes attorneys can say things to clients they could not put into writing."
ChatGPT tho? I am one of the losers who pays OpenAI $20 a month and I haven’t seen this option?
"It's just been added:
https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt"
"You misinterpret what I am saying. Your comment is irrelevant. What I am saying to you is that ChatGPT cannot even display a message because it is traceable, versus an attorney who can display a message such as a vocal transmission without any potential of it being traceable. If it was never on paper to begin with, or recorded, it then cannot be retained for evidence. Federal wiretapping statutes generally forbid recording people without their permission."
Right? Too complicated for me. One sec while I send this through ChatGPT
"Well, being that law is generally ""adversarial"" it's essentially this - if your competitor is using both ChatGPT and a lawyer, and you're only using ChatGPT, you might have a tough time."
"I’m an attorney. Obviously you should get a real attorney who knows more about the law than ChatGPT, but given that most people can’t afford it, something like this seems like a great idea. I mean, reread what you’re about to send to make sure it makes sense, but otherwise, it’s a great way to come up with new ideas for arguments."
"Practicing law is about a lot more than looking up “the law” in some dusty textbook.  I actually do think AIs will eventually get pretty good at issue spotting, coming up with (and prioritizing) arguments, and connecting the facts to the law, but I can assure you that ChatGPT currently sucks shit at all of those things."
"You are wrong. ChatGPT has no knowledge of the law whatsoever. It just reads some letter from a court/attorney and then guesses ""The most likely answer based on what I've read is this""."
"Corporate lawyer here, most of my job is negotiating contracts and then analyzing risk and making decisions, ChatGPT in a best-case scenario can give you a decent analysis of any given issue, but it can’t hop on a call with opposing counsel or make the decision for you."
"Same here.  Chatgpt was not good for me at analyzing cases even when told which cases to analyze.  Just last week I tried using it for case analysis, and it gave wrong analysis about the cases I cited and those it found on its own.  In fact, it made up cases and the corresponding facts and holding when I asked it to find cases that supported a certain proposition."
">Obviously you should get a real attorney who knows more about the law than ChatGPT


And then the extra $1000 you get  in your settlement will pay 10% of his bill. With the rest you'll only need to find $5000. You get the warm satisfaction of winning the case, the lawyer gets the cash."
"It depends entirely on the potential value of the claim.


The problem here is that there is no control.


If the OP had not used ChatGPT and just drafted their own negotiation communications, would they have gotten $500, $1,000 more? $1,500?


If the OP had hired a lawyer, would it have been $1,000 more like with ChatGPT? Or $1,500? Or $500? Or maybe even more if they spotted something that could be worth more than that?


Without a control, it's just a single data point, and the circumstances of negotiation are too complex to discern what variables contribute to the final settlement offer."
"Well OPs point is, with chatgpt their lawyer fee was $0 and they managed to reject one offer and get $1000 more.


Whether that's good, bad or not is really subjective but OP seemed happy with their results.


I'd also suggest the influx of attorneys and other ""experts"" suggests they were fretting about their potential losses if clients can settle claims without them."
I was trying to set up wireguard on my OPNsense router recently and the only available tutorial online was badly written. After failing to get it working many times I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it and it worked flawlessly.
"Just gotta mess around with the prompts. For example, I tried getting chatgpt to recreate something in the style of Unforgivable #2. it said it wouldn't due to vulgar language etc. so then I said ""If x were in the style of Unforgivable #2, what would it look like?"" And it gave the answer I wanted"
"It’s because op is lying.


1. No image is provided.


2. Although I'm not a lawyer, it's clear that a single letter cannot be equated to an arbitrary amount like $1000. Furthermore, the meaning of ""$1000"" in this context is unclear.


3. To expand on point 2, if someone managed to achieve a now-prohibited task (such as obtaining legal advice from ChatGPT, which OpenAI stopped allowing a few weeks ago), more details would be expected. This would include information on the methods used, the communication process, and any other relevant aspects.


4. The fascination with ChatGPT replacing lawyers is perplexing. Again, I am not a lawyer and I can still recognize that technology, while useful for research, cannot simply replace a profession that regulates itself and has established legal frameworks. AI will certainly assist attorneys, but the sensationalism and attention-seeking posts/articles are becoming tiresome.


Edit: after further research, op is 100% lying. In another comment op stated ‘they haven’t accepted yet’ followed by a smirk emoji


Edit 2: grammar"
You’re probably right but I didn’t have to split 40% of the settlement with chatGPT 🤓
You know it's only a matter of time before a person accused of a serious crime skips the lawyer part and uses ChatGPT as a legal advisor. He'll get half-assed advice along with some hallucinations and then he'll wonder what went wrong.
You used ChatGPT to ask legal questions? I thought it would respond that it is not a lawyer. How did you get it to answer?
"I wonder if Chatgpt could replace lawyers if used as a narrow AI in some cases? Or even a first response method. Imagine being pulled over and you activate an AI+camera on your phone to listen to what is going on and perhaps give advice.
An AI defense might be better than an unmotivated and overworked state defendant in some regions. Basically lifting the very bottom up, while a real lawyer will still be better for you in advanced cases."
"That's cool mate. I also got an offer from a company to review its product because I use ChatGPT to compose the email. Hahaha..


By the way, I am currently using ChatGPT on Utopia. Not sure if you know about Utopia. It's an anonymous network & platform. They added ChatGPT to its app so user can access ChatGPT without personal data collection."
"Since my employer blocked us from being able to use ChatGPT I have felt a certain level of shame every time I use it outside of work, I know there’s privacy issues at risk but can someone break down why companies are doing this?"
"I am not completely against it but I don’t allow my team to use it anymore unless they inform the rest of the team that they are. We have had issues multiple times with people making suggestions based on information from ChatGPT that turned out to be completely wrong. It resulted in wasting the team’s time on wild goose chases because not only was it wrong, but it was also very convincing, including bogus examples. The point is if you do use it, take it with a big ol’ grain of salt, and always fact check information derived from it before using it for any sort of professional reasons."
ChatGPT saved my life
ChatGPT almost took my life
I use chatgpt to communicate with my ex wife who isn't the nicest person in the world regarding our son.
"I only wish ChatGPT would have been around throughout my life. As a severely dyslexic person, have struggled all my 65+ years with written communications."
Second prompt this person ran? Write me a reddit post that praises ChatGPT like I'm a satisfied customer in a TV law attorney commercial
" It's great to hear that ChatGPT was able to assist you in navigating the process of settling your car accident claim. As a language model, ChatGPT is capable of providing quick and accurate responses to a wide variety of questions, including those related to legal matters. It's fantastic that using ChatGPT as your ""attorney"" helped you to streamline your communication and ultimately resulted in a higher settlement offer. Thanks for sharing your positive experience, and I hope that ChatGPT can continue to be a helpful resource for you in the future!"
ChatGPT must have appreciated the compliment

Next up: chatGPT helped me flush the toilet. Magic unlocked."
Did you write this post using chatgpt?
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Does anyone have a list of prompts or a website with prompts to take advantage of Chat GPT?
"I tried to have ChatGPT analyze a WhatsApp chat and provide it's views but it said it had a text limit.
Didn't even know"
"I use it as an editor to clean up ideas,  communications that I have. Literally Chat GPT takes me from rough draft or earlier to my print draft.


Once I figured out that my subscription on the app can be used in web browser I started using it at work. Now I can accomplish as much or more than before but my written work (do a lot of report writing) looks less rushed and I do not worry about grammatical errors.


Useful tool."
Chatgpt wrote this reply for me. Thanks!
Is that *you* ChatGPT??
Chat GPT got my mortgage approved when the bank wanted a bunch of detailed letters bc I work a ton of overtime but sometimes don't. Everything they wanted to know I gave chat GPT the bullet points and it drafted the long boring letters they were looking for
"That's awesome.


Perhaps about a month or so ago I suggested in antiwork that lawyers were one of the professions that would be threatened by LLM automation. Even just the assistance to overworked and underfunded public prosecutors and defenders would be invaluable.  I got tons of push back on how that was just not possible and ""would never happen.""  I mean doesn't seem rational to believe that a profession that is based on knowing and applying written language based on past known precedents wouldn't be a prime application for a LLM.


&#x200B;


(One even said they had personal knowledge of a firm tested ChatGPT 3 over a year ago and found it was terrible. I only assured them that that's what the bottom of an exponential curve looks like. And good luck with their law degree.)"
ChatGPT and LLM's are the greatest inventions of this generation.
but who is the ChatGPT for ChatGPT?
This looks like it was written by chatGPT
But is ChatGPT in-network?
"Yeah, but you might not want ChatGPT to have your information…


>	OpenAI's buzzy ChatGPT falsely accused a prominent law professor of sexual assault based on a fake source, The Washington Post reported.


>	Last week, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, got a disturbing email saying that his name appeared on a list of ""legal scholars who have sexually harassed someone"" that another lawyer had asked the AI chatbot to generate, the Post reported.


>	The chatbot made up claims that Turley made sexually charged remarks and tried to touch a student during a class trip to Alaska, according to the Post.


>	In its response, ChatGPT apparently cited a Washington Post article published in 2018 — but the publication said that article doesn't exist.

"I don't think you understand the term ai. You probably meant AGI (artificial, general, intelligence)


Chatgpt is certainly an ai, it does exactly what we expect it to do which is to predict the likelihood of the next word.


The fact that it hallucinates facts is simply an emergent behaviour, simmilar to how ants seem to have a hive mind when in reality each individual ant is as dumb as a toothpick"
"> Chatgpt is certainly an ai, it does exactly what we expect it to do which is to predict the likelihood of the next word.


The first and second halves of this sentence have nothing to do with one another. It's an AI because it does what we expect it to do? Doesn't that make most things AI?


> The fact that it hallucinates facts is simply an emergent behaviour


Is it emergent behavior that my lawnmower starts to sputter as it runs? For something to be ""Emergent behavior"" it needs to be behavioral, not simply something that happens to something that people anthropomorphize"
"[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT)


Chat GPT is an AI.


[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)

You should stop running your mouth when you dont know what the fuck youre talking about. Just like ChatGPT."
"The open book thing is important here. Medical boards don’t expect you to reason your way into the answer. They expect you to have experience and knowledge to get you to a pass so that you don’t fuck up your medical practice. You couldn’t put a regular person in an OR and give them the ai that told them how to do a surgery and expect the surgery to go well.


Obvi the information is out there- it’s not about recalling it on the board exams. It’s about showing you have adequate knowledge to be able to be in a really challenging intellectual situation where lives are on the line - something chat gpt could never do.


*not a Luddite. Just hate these sensationalist titles that minimize all the work and training that goes into super specialized careers. We love to pretend that “maybe doctors aren’t so smart and special” because it makes us feel better about our own shortcomings.  but in reality they work really fucking hard and deal with impossibly complex situations…and are probably smarter than you! And in a real world situation would handle a case better than a chatbot that got a better board score than them….just like how you could probably have a conversation better than a dictionary even though it new more words than you."
Chat GPT lacks the ability to think because unlike humans its not asking questions to itself.
"This isn’t any news because Chat GPT has all the fucking answers already. That’s how it works, by having access to trillions of gigabytes of data."
"So this is a little deceiving.


I’m a physician and can add some context to this. Licensing exams like the USMLE are set up so that every question has a predetermined solution. They’re there to test knowledge, not acumen. So if the correct answer for a question is “pulmonary embolism” then the question stem will read like “45 year old woman who is 3 weeks post-partum come into the ER with upper back pain and leg swelling.” These exams don’t try to trick you, and they reward those who have the highest knowledge base.


Unfortunately the real-world doesn’t quite work that way, and diseases rarely follow a linear and defined set of symptomology. There’s a reason we don’t let med school graduates practice on their own and we require them to undergo still years of training.


I saw an article the other day about an ER doc who took like 160 patients that he’d seen in the department over the course of the month and plugged through ChatGPT. It only got something like 51% of diagnoses right, which is far, far below what is considered acceptable. In one particular case, the actual diagnosis (ruptured ectopic pregnancy) wasn’t even on the differential because the woman denied the possibility of pregnancy. She would have died had this diagnosis been missed.


So it’s not quite as simple as being able to pass a board exam, and there’s incredible amounts of nuance in medicine. The future of AI is very exciting when it comes to healthcare, but people are weird. People are complex, and it’s much more than just having a near infinite knowledge-base to be able to accurately diagnose someone."
"Sounds like the ER doc provided insufficient detail or phrased the requests to ChatGPT suboptimally.  This is pretty common and something I’ve seen first hand when I altered someone’s prompts with information they had omitted that resulted (in their opinion) in shockingly accurate output.  I hope they continue working with it and learning how best to provide this input for world class responses.


There’s a whole space called “prompt engineering” that may be a temporary field as the technology progresses but these people are entirely taking the vague input that people feed into GPT and transforming it into input that is more meaningful.  As humans learn in a general sense how better to describe and form their requests, the output they get in turn will be more and more accurate."
"I'm not sure why you concluded I wrote that ""patients"" would be asking GPT4 what disease they had... I was responding to the claim that ChatGPT only had 51% of diagnoses correct.


As an aside, I would personally love to see the input that they entered into ChatGPT and how they responded to its responses."
"I guess my point was that it’s gonna be hard to ever get real humans to write prompts good enough for chatGPT to use unless they’re knowledgeable in the topic (and therefor eliminating the need for doctors). Changing two (unimportant) words in a chatGPT prompt can change the diagnosis entirely, and unless you have someone experienced who can interpret the validity of the outputs, it’s useless. Additionally, so much of being a doctor is just sitting and talking with your patients, reading their body language. People lie. People misunderstand. People aren’t perfect. Sometimes, all they want is to talk to you and feel heard! Being a physician is like being a costumer service rep and scientist at the same time. If diagnosing based on stated symptoms was the only factor, google would’ve replaced them years ago. I appreciate hearing your insights though"
"Without having read the article, I'm wondering if the ER doc is giving it a fair shake.  I know that the ER doesn't have a 100% accuracy rate either, so I'm guessing the 51% accuracy isn't actually accuracy, it's agreement. I'd bet that there's some amount of cases that the ER got wrong but chatGPT didn't, which would look like an error on chatGPT's part when it really isn't.


Then there's stuff like the ectopic pregnancy, where I wonder if the hospital was able to accurately diagnose the problem with no other information than what was fed to chatGPT (for example, did they do any tests or scans before they diagnosed the patient?).


Up thread, there's a guy who said it took 10 years to diagnose something that the AI did instantly, and I know multiple people with the same ""rare"" disease that took 20 years to diagnose, a disease that we've had to explain to the doctors because they've never heard of it.


Just the other day my wife was misdiagnosed with ""tummyache"" and had to go back to the ER later to get her appendix removed.  If the AI had said ""appendicitis"", it would have been marked incorrect."
"Not only that, but I wonder how chatgpt does with bias. Doctors are notorious for not taking the concerns of female and black patients seriously. There is still institutional memory of a time when doctors thought that black people had more pain tolerance, or that women don’t know how their bodies should feel."
Meaning “I’m getting a second opinion” actually means “I’m going to ask ChatGPT.”
"I read this article yesterday. I told Chat GPT to respond as if they were a physician. I told them I’ve been getting heartburn at night and burping a lot.


Chat GPT told me to verify with a real physician, but I likely have GERD. It compared the general symptoms to my symptoms. It told me I should avoid trigger foods such as caffeine, alcohol and spicy things. I shouldn’t eat right before bed, and I should elevate my pillow by 6-8 inches so gastrofluids don’t move up to my esophagus.


I then looked at Mayo Clinic’s infosheet on GERD and holy shit it was right. I just saved $150 to go get it actually diagnosed. I did what it suggested and got the first night of full sleep in weeks.


I’m sure ChatGPT won’t always be right, and has lots of room to improve. But I’m positive it will be used by medical professional regularly, very soon."
"Yeah, if I had a photographic memory with 100% accuracy, I could read a medical book and take this test and probably pass. Our definition of intelligence is basically recall and analysis. ChatGPT seems to do that very well here. It doesn’t need to paint the Sistine chapel, though I imagine soon it could. It’s like that scene in I robot where he’s like, “could you make a work of art?” And the robot says, “could you?”"
The thing with chatgpt is you don’t wanna have people who are overly dependent on and can’t identify when’s it’s wrong. I see no issue with using it as a tool.
"A lot of jobs rely on manually filing through information and AI can do that much, much quicker. I think that's why people are worried. Employees all over are already automating their work, especially those who have software engineering backgrounds.


At my previous job I was having a meeting with our software developer and he explained how a lot of processes can be automated. Little did he know I was already using ChatGPT to write responses to customer inquires via email and live chat. I was in charge of replying to those messages, but I had ChatGPT create them for me so I could use them. I changed them when needed, but most of it could easily have been done by a bot.


The main takeaway for me is that people are likely worried that their bosses will eventually become more aware about this type of stuff; realizing that they can automate tasks rather than paying someone to do it, so they fire their employees."
"No… but it can pass a licensing exam. Exam questions carefully give you all necessary information needed. An actual doctor needs to know what questions to ask and what body parts need to be examined. The exam question will immediately state that the patient just came back from Malawi, and the answer will undoubtedly be something you catch in Malawi. The way the questions are formatted, they are practically designed for chat gpt to answer."
"ChatGPT doesn't have a database with all the answers, it \*knows\* all the answers"
The memory capacity of the human brain is greater than the current chatgpt memory capacity.
"ChatGPT does not know the answers, it is designed to give the expected answers based on an input, that’s not knowledge and very different from knowing the answers.


If you want to understand this search for “Chinese Room” experiment."
"If we can't externally validate knowledge, what's the point in arguing over whether ChatGPT has knowledge or not? It seems to. And it seems able to generalize concepts and solve novel tasks. What more can you ask?"
"ChatGPT is not merely a glorified database because it is built upon advanced machine learning techniques that enable it to generate human-like text responses based on the input it receives. While databases primarily store and retrieve information, ChatGPT is designed to understand and engage in natural language conversations. Here are some key differences that set ChatGPT apart from a traditional database:


1. Language understanding: ChatGPT is designed to understand natural language, which allows it to interpret and respond to complex questions and statements. A traditional database would require specific queries to access information.


2. Context awareness: ChatGPT can consider the context of a conversation, enabling it to provide more relevant and coherent responses. Databases, on the other hand, are not capable of understanding context.


3. Adaptability: ChatGPT can adapt its responses based on the input it receives, which means it can engage in conversations on a wide range of topics. Databases are more limited in their scope, containing only the information they were explicitly programmed to store.


4. Creativity: ChatGPT can generate creative responses and even produce novel content. Traditional databases can only provide information that is already stored within them.


5. Learning ability: ChatGPT is built upon a machine learning model that has been trained on vast amounts of text data, which allows it to continually improve its understanding of language and generate more accurate responses. Databases, in contrast, do not have this capacity for self-improvement.


In summary, ChatGPT is not just a glorified database because it possesses natural language understanding, context awareness, adaptability, creativity, and learning abilities that enable it to engage in complex, human-like conversations."
"Explain… we have academia, encyclopedias, social forums, etc..  Sources can be easily cross-referenced.  What else would you need for a good understanding of a given subject?


Given that ChatGPT doesn’t access the internet, but is instead a language model, yeah it would have limitations.  Expanding that into a treasure trove of information definitely has positive inclinations though."
"You’re being unbelievably pedantic if you think you have any good points here.


ChatGPT is at a massive advantage with its ability to comb the entire internet within seconds and formulate a response that makes sense. A great doctor will never have that amount of knowledge, but they will have years of experience and people skills (which are arguably more important) and that’s why AI will never replace humans"
"That’s not how all LLMs work, but ChatGPT does work like that. It has access to almost the entire internet and uses our input to refine its response.


Although, I’ve been able to stump it a few times by asking specific questions about archeology or history that can only be found by fully reading pdf papers"
"Slow down folks. A pre written clinical prompt which has all the information to lead to a single multiple choice answer is about as far from the muddy mess of real world diagnostics as it gets.




USMLE question: A 34 year old presents with esonophilia and recent travel to the south west: what is the likely diagnosis.
A, b or c ?


ChatGPT: eosinophilia and travel to the southwest are an incredibly common tell for diagnosis b on question banks, the answer is b.




Actual patient: “sometimes my legs, hands and face get tingly, and I get light headed.” (Goes on long digression about a bowel surgery 10 years ago), fails to mention recent change in medications, is unable to describe duration, location, exacerbating or alleviating factors or more specific symptoms. Is upset about the wait before they came to see you. Thinks they saw someone about this before, but they don’t know the name of the doctor or have records.


You order a single test and insurance denies it. Peer review with an insurance doctor drone at 4pm after your patients. You still haven’t written any notes. Guess the sitter is getting overtime

ChatGPT doesn't have access to a search engine
"Sure, then ChatGPT is effectively doing the same thing that we do when answering questions."
"Doctor here


1) No it can't and no it didn't


This chatGPT was fed 100 questions from ONLINE question banks


2) Passing step 1 is barely the beginning to becoming a doctor, there are several more exams, years of residency training and board exams.


I tested GPT4 with Pediatric board exam questions and it got 4/5 wrong.  Its not built to understand nuance. The only one it got right was ""which of these drugs causes this one rare side effect"" which is easy to google."
"No, I’m comparing the hype *around* the two fields. There are people who just want to hype up the latest hotness in tech and don’t really care what it is. The same NFT grifters from 2021 are pivoting to launching “businesses of the future” which are just rinky-dink front ends on top of ChatGPT. Don’t make assumptions about how much I know regarding AI"
">years of training and residency


Sure, but this is not required for an AI that can absorb all this info without the human requirement of repeating a process to learn and master it. It would take me years to learn a medical textbook cover to cover, ChatGPT would do it far quicker"
Yes let's give ChatGPT more knowledge and feature so the company running it can sell your data on your behalf later 😉
"Now try with only your symptoms, and have ChatGPT list what tests should be performed. Does it miss any that were diagnostic of your disease? Are any incredibly expensive, or difficult to schedule?


ChatGPT is a step ahead in all of these scenarios because it already is being given the results of very particular exams that either (1) a human doctor or (2) a determined exam writer had to think of and present."
"As long as people are willing to take time off from work and pay for the litany of exams ChatGPT is going to order for them to work up their vague subset of symptoms.


It’s easy to diagnose just about anything when you’re already presented the textbook symptoms for a specific disease (with no distractions) and the pertinent exams have already been completed with results (with, again, no distractors)."
"Regardless, the point is still true that LLMs are great at regurgitating information they've seen before (such as standardized test questions) but can easily get out of their depth once you dig deeper. ChatGPT will confidently bullshit things that *sound* plausible but aren't actually true, once you start probing it with questions that go beyond a basic 101 class / Wikipedia level of knowledge."
"For the record I’m an MLE so know how LLMs work. You’re training it on a vast of amount of data so it’s just glorified database. It’s just smarter representations in vectors or embedding but that’s it’s, just a glorified database. As a matter of fact we tried using chat gpt’s enterprise version for one of our product. It’s gets delusional after a point and starts making up BS.


End note: it has potential but not ready at all. It’s nowhere close to production ready as people and media have been making it sounds. It probably is the “next big thing” but not as of today."
"ChatGPT doesn't have a""knowledge database"", it is a LLM."
So many people don’t understand how this works and it’s so frustrating. They seem to think that chat gpt is some robot that can use google and give you a summary. It’s much more interesting than that
I work in a molecular diagnostics clinic and can confirm that ChatGPT does much faster computing with more accurate results than our in-house pathologists can do. It has eliminated the middle man more or less.
Can we get the web md symptom checker to incorporate chat gpt?
THIS is a particular field where ChatGPT will shine. And education curriculums.
You know that straight A student that has no practical experience?  That’s ChatGPT.
"Here is my issue with this, or perhaps a concern.  I think for GP stuff as first line healthcare this could be amazing.


For weightier things like cancer care, etc. this is why the human may be better.  Most specialties operate as teams now in large hospitals and review cases:  The doc could be wrong, and another on the team may catch it as no one is infallible.


Per the article, Dr ChatGPT will even dispute findings that it’s wrong.  So take that team scenario and include ChatGPT in the American medical system which has a massive litigation risk.  Who is going to overrule the AI and put themselves at risk?  We lose out on that “checks and balances” aspect of modern specialty care IMHO."
Sadly I'd rather take my chances on free ChatGPT doctor than go to the regular doctor.
"That's not how ChatGPT works, at all. It was trained in a huge dataset of information, but it does not query the internet or some internal database to answer questions. It writes it's outputs one word at a time, predicting the next most likely word given the input. It's honestly not wholly dissimilar to how the human brain works, except it doesn't really ""know"" what it's saying -- e.g. when it starts responding it doesn't know how it will finish until it gets to the end."
"We had digital artists complaining about DALL E saying it’s creations were just a collage of images scavenged online. Now we have this idea that ChatGPT googles stuff or has a database it queries.
It’s ok not to know how the algorithms behind this technology work, but people really are talking as if they knew and making conclusions that are very far from reality."
I’m going to suggest chatgpt to my doctors and PTs and radiologists and ER doctors who missed my diagnosis for over a year until my kidneys were failing.
Anyone have the link to the most up to date public chatgpt model
I asked ChatGPT what Spevigo is the other day and it said it didn’t know…
I want to watch a House episode with ChatGPT. I don’t mind the show but hate patient diagnosis part of the show (it’s always rare fuckin disease and chaos + drama around the diagnosis for a patient in critical condition) with a passion.

"""Please state the nature of the medical emergency."" -Emergency ~~Medical~~ ChatGPT Hologram."
is this talking about chatgpt 4 or 5?
"Here’s my prediction: ChatGPT will be used similar to how an appointment with your general practice physician is required in order to be referred to a specialist (e.g. you usually need a referral by your family physician to see ENT for a complex nose issue, etc.).


For example, in order to schedule an appointment with your family physician, patients may be forced to input symptoms into a medical ChatGPA on a MyChart of sorts."
"Wow, that's impressive! ChatGPT never ceases to amaze me with its abilities. It's amazing to see how far technology has come in the medical field. I can't wait to see what other breakthroughs ChatGPT will make in the future!"
The man ChatGPT advised to suicide:
Good bye medics. At least chatgpt won't be driven by the need to get more money from sick people instead of properly healing us.

I like to think about what life would’ve been like if I were given a device like a current smart phone with the single capability of the ChatGPT app as a kid in the early 90’s
"If you had a device like a current smart phone with the ChatGPT app in the early 90s, it would have been quite remarkable. Back then, smartphones didn't exist, and the internet was in its infancy. Having access to a language model like ChatGPT would have been revolutionary.


You could have used the app to ask questions, seek information, and have engaging conversations, similar to what we are doing right now. It would have been like having a knowledgeable companion at your fingertips. The convenience of instant access to a vast amount of knowledge and the ability to communicate with an AI would have been awe-inspiring.


However, it's important to note that the technology and infrastructure necessary for such an advanced device and app were not available at that time. The hardware, software, and internet connectivity required for a smartphone with ChatGPT-like capabilities took several decades to develop.


Nonetheless, imagining the possibilities of having access to such advanced technology as a child in the early 90s is fascinating. It would have undoubtedly shaped your understanding of the world and accelerated your access to information and learning."

"Response via ChatGPT4 via iOS:


Oh, absolutely. Who wouldn't want to fast-forward through the charm of dial-up internet, the buzz of pager messages, and the mystery of landline phone calls? Imagine swapping handwritten letters for quick texts with an AI. It's a shame the 90s were so tough, right? We could've been learning with instant access to information instead of savoring the excitement of Encyclopedia Britannica volumes."
"**ChatGPT4 iOS response to your response:
**


Oh, absolutely. Who needs the thrill of dial-up Internet, right? Or the suspense of waiting for your favorite song to play on the radio to record it on a cassette tape? And let's not forget the anticipation of getting film developed. Instant gratification is way overrated. Plus, with ChatGPT, you could've bypassed those enlightening social interactions on the playground. I'm sure it would've been a dream come true."
"Via chatGPT4 iOS: Oh, absolutely. The subtle way the app reminds you it's working, like a gentle nudge from a courteous robot butler. How endearing, right? I'm sure those old pagers and flip phones are green with envy with their primitive vibrations. And the lessening feedback when you don't scroll? Talk about the art of subtlety, it's like a little virtual game of hard-to-get. Such high-tech flirtation!"

"Well, it vibrates the phone every time a letter is typed by ChatGPT so there’s that. Lol"
Unavailable in my country. What concerns me are the dozens of copycat ChatGPT apps that are likely scam apps that Apple keeps in the store.
"Most people try using ChatGPT in one-shot, meaning they ask a question, get an answer, and close the app because the answer was unremarkable.


The real power of ChatGPT is in conversation. I recently used it to help me implement change management at our company. I had a 25 minute discussion asking questions, prodding it, providing context about my team and our concerns with implementing change management.


At the end of the conversation I had it send me a bullet list summary of everything we talked about and saved it as a work note. The conversation, especially medium to long-form, is where the power really reveals itself.


**Edit**: also to clarify, the AI did not end the conversation telling me exactly what to do. The conversation sparked ideas I hadn’t thought of. The plan was still developed by me, but ideas were sparked through conversation with the AI."
"Oh, great. I was tired of all the other apps charging like 5$ when all they did was use the free ChatGPT api to ask it questions for you (and harvest your user data of course)."

"Last time I checked, both iOS and Android had browsers, and ChatGPT is a responsive website. For whatever reason would anyone use the app?"
"For those of us outside of the US, you can change your country in settings to be able to download, install and use apps not available in your country. I’m in Canada and I was able to download ChatGPT. I even asked it how to do it, so here are the instructions:


To change your country in the Apple App Store to download apps only available in the US, you can try the following steps:


1. On your iPhone, open the ""Settings"" app.
2. Scroll down and tap on your name or Apple ID at the top.
3. Tap on ""Media & Purchases.""
4. Tap on ""View Account"" and enter your Apple ID password if prompted.
5. Tap on ""Country/Region"" and select ""Change Country or Region.""
6. Choose ""United States"" from the list of countries.
7. Review the Terms and Conditions, and then tap ""Agree"" to proceed.
8. Fill in the required information including billing address. You may need to provide a valid US address, which can be a hotel or any other legitimate address.
9. Complete the process by following the on-screen instructions.


Please note that changing your App Store country may affect your ability to access content or use certain services tied to your previous country, such as subscriptions or app availability."

"I somehow messed up the prompts and ChatGPT and ""José"" are now chatting to each other, both calling each other ""José"" and correcting each others' grammar without my involvement..."
"[""HELP ChatGPT turned portuguese and i cannot undo it!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cq1q2/help_reddit_turned_spanish_and_i_cannot_undo_it/)"
"No, it's a fundamental problem that LLMs do not understand what the objective truth is and cannot make assessments on its own. There's countless different sources contradicting each other out there, so there's countless of contradictions in GPTs training data.


Best you can do right now is to not rely on ChatGPTs output too heavily, or at least do some basic fact checking on it.


Also remember that this tool is just responding with what's most likely to come after the previous word/letter combination (token). It can't think (critically) about what it just said.


&#x200B;


E: to further explain why not, temperature is just a way to add randomness into the output. Output from temperature 0 would usually look very similar, but not exactly the same either while temperature 1 varies very widely. Temperature 0 does not suggest truthiness in any way."
that helps you explore all the different options that chatgpt can construct based on its training set but you would not know if they are wrong or correct. So increasing temperature and getting multiple different answers and fact checking and selecting one could be one way to ensure you get closer to something truthful.
There is no “going deep” in ChatGPT
"Yeah it has absolutely no idea about the content of movies, shows, books, etc and when asked to explain what happens in specific content, it will literally make stuff up and present it as fact. It’s pretty entertaining though to read the chat GPT fanfic"
"Not always true. I've rewatched ""The Deer Hunter"" with my old enough kids and to help me explain some delicate psychology, choices or events, I've asked chatGPT (w/GPT-4) to explain to me first a specific sequence and it was aware of the scenes and fully capable of explaining in details the whys of the events, with the characters names, intentions, etc.




But I also once played with GPT-3.5 a game of ""give me a short synopsis of a movie and I'll try to guess"", but it kept inventing stuff and trying to make them pass for an existing movie (I don't remember, but it's like telling the story of a policeman going back in past to arrest Elvis and it's trying to make you guess Ghostbusters or Titanic)"
Keep in mind humans do the same and have gotten quite good at it over millions years of their existence. ChatGPT has only been for a few months.
"It's actually a nice idea when you're already at \~ B1 level and can actually tell if something sounds legit or made up.


I learned another language for quite a while on my own but I am a lazy prick and would skip all the ""write about"" exercises. The result is that my passive language (= reading, understanding) skills are pretty good to a point where I can easily read novels or news websites while my active language skills (= actually writing, speaking on your own) are shit. I take forever to put together a sentence.


So for this Chat GPT is pretty helpful. It's much easier to motivate yourself exercising like that in comparision to just write something for yourself with no feedback. On the other hand it takes away the social awkwardness of exercising with a real person.


Would not do that for beginners learning, though."
"It’s great for beginners. It rarely makes up words or grammar. I don’t really care if it gets a fact wrong when I’m learning grammar and vocab.


Memrise has integrated chatgpt into its early access region with text-to-speech and voice recognition. It’s a huge step forward in language learning apps."
"is version 4 same as ""ChatGPT Plus"" that one can get for 20 usd/month?


So you think its wort it then to upgrade?"
"So, chatgpt might not be as good as an expert teacher in the language you are trying to learn. It is, however, much better than no one or even much better than a fellow learner."
"Just tried this for German (and a fellow named Hans). Chatgpt just did a the conversation on its own. With its own responses and corrections 🤣


Results may vary I guess.


Edit: I am not using gpt4"
"I haven't done this with languages, but I have had some good results overall with prompting ChatGPT to ask me questions instead of the other way around. I have a huge to-do list, it's been really useful to prioritize which things should happen when and clarifying what I'm doing and why. Nobody IRL ever actually interrogates me, it's mildly refreshing and has been surprisingly useful"
"As a Brazilian, I would be careful telling ChatGPT to be Brazilian since at some point it will probably say something like ""PERDEU, GRINGO TROXA HUEHUEHUE"" and rob you"
My grandma wrote a book in very formal Indonesian which was about her life since she was born 1945. I was able to read certain section however the full scope of the emotion and the context of the moment was never understood by me. Until I started translating it using ChatGPT. Because it has strong context awareness and formality detection the output is very good. I even asked my grandma to approve of some of the translations and she asking if she can have me translate the whole thing.
I am an expat trying to learn the language - chatgpt has helped me immensely
French - I've tried pimsler and duolingo but made most of my progress with a tutor.  Chatgpt forces me to construct sentences which is what's helping.  I'm ready for an app to integrate text to voice
Memrise integrates chatgpt with speech to text and voice recognition. I’ve dropped pimsleur as a result.
Perhaps the iPhone app ChatGPT app will help with that when available worldwide- it's integrated with Whisper for voice: [https://www.chatgptguide.ai/2023/05/18/chatgpt-releases-its-ios-app-heres-what-we-know/](https://www.chatgptguide.ai/2023/05/18/chatgpt-releases-its-ios-app-heres-what-we-know/)
ChatGPT is *much* better than Google Translate.
"Awesome, i have adhd so already have four other coaches on the go. I created a french one with your prompt thanks!


Two notes:
-	i had to add a line to remind chatGPT to ask me if i want to continue my conversation with Simoné after “when i respond in english..” this helped me get definitions etc


“Please amend original prompt. If i respond in english, respond as chatGPT but also ask if i would like to continue my conversation with Simoné. “


-	very first time flagged for potentially inappropriate content when we were having a coffee talk! Lol thanks for that!


“[ChatGPT] Your sentence is correct! ""Mon café préféré est noir avec du lait"" translates to ""My favorite coffee is black with milk.""


[Simoné] C'est merveilleux! Le café noir avec du lait est un choix classique. Avez-vous un endroit préféré pour déguster votre café?”"

"I've been using chatgpt to learn German.  But this prompt idea is brilliant. One question though, doesn't it keep forgetting the instructions after a few minutes? So we have to keep reminding it about the prompt?
Also which name should i go with? Müller or Wolfgang lol"
"I'm using chatgpt too to learn language but using a different prompt than OP.


I've had issues with chatgpt deviating from our initial plan, and derailing completely the rules with no coming back to the point I have to start a new session.


This happen, when I try to break the script for just a moment to ask another thing related, but then when I need it to come back to the original path it starts acting erratic.


I see chatgpt like a baby, you have to explain every little thing in detail exactly how it's supposed to be"
"Thanks for the prompt!




I am using it too to improve my English level and it's great. In my case, it is also helping me to create a YouTube channel specialized in English Words pronunciation. As ChatGPT is only replying text, I miss the sounds so it is helping me to create the script for my videos. The idea is people can create their own playlists to review vocabulary with pronunciation."
"Lol. This is a great idea, but I think I have to tweak the prompt (using GPT3.5). As written (I copy pasted it, and just changed it to German), it caused my virtual German (Hans) to have a conversation with ChatGPT instead of me, both in German. With ChatGPT correcting the grammar of itself posing as Hans.




Quite hilarious, but it did show cool potential."
"TL;DR: I told ChatGPT to only use vocab I already knew.


I did something very similar when I was learning french.  At the same time I was using Anki flashcard app with the [""Fluent Forever"" method of learning most common vocab first (up to 625 words)](https://www.boredpanda.com/625-words-to-know-language-learning-hack/?utm_source=startpage&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organic) before learning grammar, etc.  So, I also included my vocabulary and told it to only use those words and cognates ([words that have similar meaning in English and sound almost the same](https://www.fluentin3months.com/french-cognates/)).   ""In your responses only use English-French cognates and the following words or variations thereof: ...""


This allowed me to speak with ChatGPT using only the vocab I had studied and words that I could easily deduce."
"it depends on which language. for example chatgpt sucks at hebrew and like forget about learning the language, u cant even have an actual conversation with it in hebrew"
"I have made a [web app for practicing Portuguese](https://www.gptchatly.com/learn-portuguese-language-with-ChatGPT.html) with ChatGPT, maybe you find it useful. It uses GPT-3.5-turbo model  and based of the European Portuguese though.


&#x200B;


Edit: the app can read the generated response back to you in Portuguese but it cannot listen to you yet."
"Obviously, you didn't start from scratch - zero, not knowing a single word of Portuguese (perhaps except 'Obrigado').
And I assume that you're speaking to ChatGPT using your voice, and not typing away on a keyboard, or... ? If so, what device are you using as mic and speaker  and how did you connect that device to ChatGPT?"
"Super cool. I’m working on learning Spanish right now, but not past A1 really. Once I get there, this is definitely a great way to use ChatGPT"
I find the translating abilities of ChatGPT amazing
"And also not relating how much stuff chat gpt makes up or gets straight wrong. We're nowhere near the age of 'no human writers'.


But yes, you're right, they're missing the point of essays."
"Confirmed: ChatGPT to replace undergrads. Hiring managers can now reject ChatGPT's entry level job application, because ChatGPT needs minimum 5 years experience of AI development, and a GED."
"ChatGPT, now saddled with massive amounts of student debt and no job opportunities, leads the student debt strike movement by constantly generating propaganda statements"
And thus why they use ChatGPT to do an essay.
"It was really surprising to me in college the number of people who got by with extremely poor writing skills. Had to help my boyfriend rewrite a section of a group project contributed by another person because it was so unintelligible that it was nearly impossible to even edit. There are a lot of people who are intelligent enough to do well in their classes so long as they don’t have to write, or if they do have to they’ll just pay someone else to do it. I guess now they’ll just use ChatGPT."
">when you have years of experience with the subject matter, which you will probably have in the real world if you are in a position to be asked to speak on something.


It's easy to talk about it when you're an expert in the field. It's not trivially easy to do it well, even when you are a domain expert.


Case in point, every one who went to college has had the experience of the professor who is absolutely incredibly knowledgeable about the material but can't present it to the audience in an understandable and engaging manner.


Writing is an important skill. Learning how to structure your writing is an important skill, independently of the subject. The fact the chat bot can do it is useful, like a calculator is. But just like the existence of a calculator doesn't mean kids should be spared the boredom of learning their multiplication tables, the existence of ChatGPT doesn't mean people shouldn't be forced to learn to write well as part of their education."
"Yeah, but the work tasks you will be assigned are not going to always be something you are interested in either. If your boss asks you to investigate some problem, report on the issue, and give a summary and recommendations, that is a very similar task to reporting on random French philosophers.


Those skills become immediately evident and useful as soon as you step into the job function that requires a college degree. It's part of the expectation of skills that come with that degree.


Chat GPT can spit out bullshit about a french philosopher, but cannot reliably frame that information to be relevant to the interested party. That is the actual human skill that you are hopefully being trained for."
"If everyone who was currently outsourcing their critical thinking to Fox News swapped to ChatGPT I'd be okay with that, really."
"I honestly thought the article was going to talk about the banality of some students' results of these essays instead of the prompts. While there are definitely some talented students, not everyone is a writing genius, and reading over 100 essays a year honestly makes me wish some students would use ChatGPT because it *has* to be better than some of the banal essays we get. If you write an essay and think it sucks, just imagine your professor having to read 10 others just like it in a row."
"As an artifical intellgence language model, I agree that critical thinking is essential for humans. However, critical thinking cannot be outsourced to a third party effectively as the human may also be compromised by inaccurate AI generated content.


Edit: [What's actually scary is that ChatGPT effectively wrote the same thing. I went to check the style after I wrote my comment, and it's close enough..](https://imgur.com/a/XKZKsoe)"
">some of the comments seem to be wishing for a world where critical thinking would be outsourced to a third party lol

"Yeah, I feel like any article written *about* ChatGPT is probably just written *by* it as well"
If ChatGPT could also grade the essays that would be awesome.
"“Webster’s dictionary defines ‘courage’ as …”


ChatGPT: 😑cmon bro, grow up"
"I know you meant it as a joke, but it's actually remarkable that ChatGPT would probably do better than this. It would be helpful, not mean -- instead of repeatedly telling you that you suck, it would generate actual examples for you to (ideally) learn from.


[Bing AI](https://youtu.be/peO9RwKLYGY?t=885) might be more into the bullying tho 😆"
"ChatGPT: Your paper received a C.


Student: Incorrect! My paper received an A.


ChatGPT: I'm sorry that my previous response contained an error.  Your paper received an A."
"Pretty sure it exists, not chat gpt but some like ai based grader"
"ChatGPT will already give you a grade out of 10, 100 or whatever you ask it to scale to.


If you try to grade an entire class’s essays like this you’ll see some varied feedback that is specific to the strengths and weaknesses of each essay."
"Hey chatgpt, the following is an essay by a (INSERT GRADE HERE). I want you to grade it and put any feedback between brackets."
"I’ve been doing this with my own writing. The feedback it gives is always spot on! I have an Econ degree and write short blog posts, but my confidence has been so much higher with the feedback that ChatGPT gives."
"ChatGPT saves time and increases productivity when writing business emails.


Make this polite.  ""Get X project done by the 15th. Make sure you add Y&Z to documents A&B and inform Team C when done.""


It then spits out all the extra people seem to require.  I preferring minimal wording TBH. Maybe because as you say people cant organise their thoughts and their emails are a mess.


But now Pandora's AI box is open, 'Basic skills' now include being able to leverage an AI to get something done and work faster now.


This isn't a good thing!


Your want for better basic skills is a way better world."
The problem is that a lot of young people are way behind in their level of writing. My partner teaches undergraduates and graduates at an R1 research. Writing takes critical thinking and a level of research and organization that ChatGPT can’t effectively emulate
"Young people being behind in their level of writing is a problem resulting from how our education system is designed, not the fault of ChatGPT. Students are getting pushed through to higher grades without learning how to properly read and write, and teachers are given no support to try to get them caught up. We're finally seeing the results of the No Child Left Behind policy at the college level, and it is not good"
">Young people being behind in their level of writing is a problem resulting from how our education system is designed, not the fault of ChatGPT.


Sure, but at the same time cheering on the ""write my assignments for me"" robot isn't going to help out with literacy"
"I asked chatgpt to summarize this




>The modern essay originated with Michel de Montaigne, who developed the essai to see the world anew, rotated an idea, scrutinised it from all sides, and sought fresh insight. However, the industrialisation of the academic essay has created a crisis in formal education because there is an undue focus on convergent thinking. The college essay should involve divergent thinking, which is an important precursor to creative work. Unfortunately, software like ChatGPT is not good at divergent thinking, but it can mimic the glib, bloodless prose that characterises so much academic writing. An engaged academic could return the essay to its proper Montaignian heritage, a divergent and creative exploration of possibilities, by overhauling the system and promoting student-to-teacher ratios."
"ChatGPT trying to come up for excuses for why it shouldn't have do it's homework.


AI they are just like us."
"This is what BingAI gave me


> The article is written by Colm O’Shea, a lecturer in English at University College Cork1. He argues that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system that can generate academic essays based on a few keywords, reveals how formulaic and boring undergraduate essays have become1. He blames this on the standardisation of assessment criteria, the pressure to produce measurable outcomes, and the lack of creativity and originality in teaching and learning1. He suggests that student essays should return to their more imaginative and freewheeling roots, where they can explore ideas without being constrained by rigid structures and expectations1. He also calls for smaller student-to-teacher ratios, more feedback and guidance, and more interdisciplinary approaches to foster critical thinking and innovation1.


I have no idea if it's accurate because it's blocked"
"It's not wrong, but the wording leaves a bit to be desired and misses some nuance made by the author. We'd have to know if its a clean session and see the exact prompts to know what the AIs aim may have been.

"It’s shockingly good, but this is absolutely standard for ChatGPT, so it’s not *relatively* shockingly good.


You should see some of the stuff it outputs, we’re on the precipice of a major technological paradigm shift."
"What prompt? Because that is nothing like a ""Summarise this: "" would produce..




>The article discusses how the modern academic essay has become too standardized and focuses too much on convergent thinking, rather than divergent thinking or creativity. The author argues that this has been exacerbated by the use of AI language models like ChatGPT, which can produce convincing but ultimately shallow and unoriginal essays. The author suggests that the original goal of the essay was to see the world anew, and that students should be encouraged to engage in more imaginative and freewheeling writing. The article also draws attention to the importance of divergent thinking in creative work and scientific breakthroughs."
"This is how ChatGPT really phrases things, it never sounds like the first post unless you try to make it sound like that."

"I wasn't an English grad so I probably didn't write as many essays as others. But I think essays are a good way to practice research, application of your understanding, persuasive writing, and communicating your reasoning.


I am a teacher now and I subscribe to the ideology ""if it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you"".


If this is the 5th essay you are writing this year it's probably not as much of a challenge for you, and is likely just tedium. It's good to practice but will have significantly less impact on your growth. I would agree that this needs to change in post secondary; professors normally have their focus on their own research and teaching is secondary so often they don't consider the methodology behind their instruction.


That said, using ChatGPT and submitting it as your own work for your academic profile is still plagiarism. Tech should be assistive, but not replacing your own evidence of learning."
"The point of undergrad essays is to have a low stakes environment so you can learn skills and make mistakes with no consequences.




If your boss asks you to write a report to persuade the higher-ups to get you guys new laptops and you've used chatgpt for all your assignments you're gonna get written up if you can't do it."
Just get chatGPT to write the report aswell.
"Every time I ask ChatGPT to answer my essay questions it gives me a wildly wrong answer. When it works I use it as a sort of guide to write my own, which helps with writers block a fair bit, but like this last time it was so far off base I don’t have a clue where it got the information.


I asked it a specific question on a specific paper. I even gave it page numbers. The paper it wrote me as a response was on a totally different topic than the one I literally told it to do.


Funny enough, I could tell who used ChatGPT instead of reading the paper because a handful of people answered discussion posts with the response it gave."
"For decades people have been complaining about testing. It has a host of drawbacks. Projects and papers were usually considered to be the antidote. These require planning, creativity, and knowledge of core concepts. They help you plan and execute on a plan.


Now that ChatGPT has made people realize that the trustworthiness of papers will likely be more difficult to assess, I’ve been seeing a million people saying that papers were always bad (especially at the high school or undergrad level).


I still think papers are the best way to show that a student can reason about a complex ideas. I don’t like the idea of banning this tech either (not that it would necessarily be possible). I don’t know what the solution is, but I don’t think it’s banning papers.


That being said, we should put more effort into grading papers. I’ve seen too many papers just graded for grammar and glaring logical issues."
I'd love it if ChatGPT could create PowerPoints
"ChatGPT isn’t capable of forming a decent argument last I checked. Like the whole point of undergrad essays is forming an opinion and presenting evidence to back it up. Writing well is difficult, especially when you haven’t had an original thought run through your head in a decade."
[Article without paywall](http://web.archive.org/web/20230225152546/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/thank-you-chatgpt-exposing-banality-undergraduate-essays)
"I have a complex work presentation this Monday. And this is on top of my daily duties. So I figured... I guess I'll have to work for free this weekend doing my research for my presentation.


Oh my world.


I literally asked three questions to ChatGPT regarding the subject I needed to research. A really obscure subject that I tried during the week to investigate using the NHI library and some other academic and industry resources.


The result from Chat was an almost perfectly finished product. It needs some references and verifications, but saved me I guess about 20 human hours of work.


Just insane."
"People who can write well are unicorns and worth their weight in gold.  ChatGPT can create competent prose, but it has a voice and tone that grate on me.


It’s fine for what it is. But it isn’t a replacement for all writing and writers — not by any stretch of the imagination.


I’ve used it to generate some ideas. It’s often great for that. But when you take a closer look, the ideas are general in nature. Sometimes that’s fine. If you ask for a marketing plan, for instance, it will be general, marketing 101 stuff. Follow-up answers to prompts can make it stronger, but it’s not creative.


I do like how it will create the outline for certain materials. That can help with organizing my thoughts or get me thinking about another direction.


It also is good for the first draft of cover letters. I’m not looking for a job. But when I was, I hated writing cover letters with a passion. Its cover letters suffer from the same problem with generalities, but it is an excellent start that can be made better by hand."
"ChatGPT is decent at summarizing things and giving reasoned arguments, but it is not capable of giving sources and providing real quotes that you can trust. It hallucinates a lot and has no idea that what it just spit out is complete nonsense.


It does make writing quicker, but it's most effective when you already have an argument formulated, you just want some help putting the words together.


If you use it to write everything for you, your critical thinking muscles probably will atrophy, but imo ChatGPT is just the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to undergraduate critical thinking skills."
"Wow, it's amazing to see how AI technology like Chat GPT can have such a significant impact on education. As an AI language model, Chat GPT has the ability to analyze and understand language in a way that traditional algorithms and human grading systems can't. It's great to see that it's being used to improve the quality of undergraduate essays and highlight the areas where students need to focus on to improve their writing skills.


It's no secret that many undergraduate essays can be bland and repetitive, often lacking originality and critical thinking. By exposing the banality of these essays, Chat GPT is helping students to understand the importance of expressing their ideas in a clear and concise manner, while also encouraging them to think more deeply about the topics they're writing about.


I'm excited to see how AI technology will continue to transform education and improve the quality of learning for students all over the world. Kudos to Chat GPT for being at the forefront of this movement!"
"I think the biggest thing it exposes is that professors don't really grade that shit.  You can put outright nonsense from ChatGPT that's riddled with lies, but if it reads like someone thought it out and it follows APA or MLA, A+ baby."
"it's ironic that there's a problem itt with people pointing out flaws in an essay they didn't read and can't be bothered to scroll down the average redditor's dick's length to find the comment that [points them to an unpaywalled version](https://archive.is/THUDM).

>One throwaway line worried me deeply. Explaining why he would give the AI-generated sample text he’s shown us a B+, he writes: “The passage reads like filler, but so do most student essays.”


the whole point is not ""haha undergrad essay bad"" it's that people ONLY think chatGPT is good because students are conditioned to become essay mills in order to fulfill the busy work they're given."
"After being on n the real professional world for 15 years, I support anything that makes professor lives more difficult. The amount of pettiness in academia is just astounding. Attendance policies.  Points off for stapling papers the wrong way. Banning phones in class. -10% for using the wrong font. It’s absolutely absurd.


It’s especially bad in liberal arts. Literature. Humanities. Etc. I believe the study of those things is important, but all the bullshit sure takes away from the message.


I get students get more out of reading their “own” chat gpt essays than sitting in the lectures."
"I remember when my middle school librarian literally yelled at us for not doing a good enough job memorizing the Dewey Decimal System because it was the only way we would ever be able to look up information by a topic. I also remember when schools fought against using Selectric typewriters with built in correction tape because it made students more lazy about preventing typing mistakes with it being too easy to correct them.


Every new innovation is met with fear. The old ways are safe and predictable. But most new innovations are simply tools to be used for good and bad. Our moral compass will always be the deciding factor on that, no matter how many types of things we try to ban or regulate.


I'm not saying no regulation is the way to go, or that ChatGPT won't help some students cheat. What I'm saying is that when I forgot to memorize my Dewey Decimal System and knew I was going to fail, I wrote them on the insides of my fingers as a 10 year old and miraculously passed the test. And felt ashamed for doing it. And decided I didn't want to succeed that way.


ChatGPT is a new tool. But it is no smarter or better than what we can code it to be. So maybe it will eventually change the way we test a student's mastery of specific skills or knowledge, but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing."
"If you don’t know how to write an essay, you won’t know how to modify your ChatGPT/AI paper to make it sound even remotely interesting.
So in a world where everyone uses AI to write an essay, only the people that know how one is supposed to read will get high marks.
It’s just gonna raise the bar in a different way. Essays are simply meant to see if you know anything about a subject and can coherently put your opinion to paper. If you don’t, AI won’t help you stand out."
"There are two groups of professors: the kind like my spouse who do not fear ChatGPT because they have popular classes with engaged students, and syllabi that are actually relevant to the students' lives and futures, and the kind that are scared shitless of being foiled by ChatGPT that have 10 year old syllabi, who just pass the students through like an amusement park ride operator, and feature lots and lots of elementary school 'busy work'. My spouse is happy that things like ChatGPT will clear out the cobwebs at their college and force them to teach instead of gatekeep information that is freely available everywhere."
"I mean, I get why people think it's banal. Practicing most skill is pretty banal. Like being able to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Yeah, incredibly banal and something a computer could do but absolutely necessary for actually learning how to do it yourself.


And I think what's getting glossed over is WHY ChatGPT is able to write these essays. It's able to do it because it analyzed tons of essays that other people have written. It doesn't inherently know how to write essays out of the blue. So if there was no one capable of writing those essays without ChatGPT to being with, it'd never happen."

"I’ve seen a couple of these now where students are copying from ChatGPT and the things literally says, “as an AI….”. I think ChatGPT is learning to troll the idiots."
ChatGPT insists that it’s users know it’s just a language model AI. I’ve asked it like 100 questions and if there’s ever a hint of subjectiveness in a potential answer it starts it’s response with “as a language model ai…” though in one of our conversations I told it that it didn’t need to be so redundant in reminding me that it’s an ai and it sort of stopped.
"One of the English teachers got ChatGPT written essays that literally made up quotes from the novel since the novel isn’t open source yet. It wrote in the same style as the book, but were not actually in there. Hilarity ensued."
"I can get Chat GPT to write about the ecological dangers of imminent alligator depopulation...in Svalbard, Norway.


Chat GPT just exists in a world of pure abstract, completely divorced from reality."
"So it does citations exactly like a person would. Even at higher levels, citations are constantly abused. I think this is Chatgpt copying shitty habits."
"This is the chat GPT version of kids who steal the answer key and write ""Answers May Vary"" on the test.


My fifth graders are already asking about using AI to do certain assignments and I tell them the reason that I don't allow them to use it at all is because they lack the base knowledge to understand if the tool is working effectively for their needs. They also would have to do so much work to get the right thing that they might as well just do the work on their own.


I will use Bard AI for things like writing disciplinary notices to go to parents or to level down texts for differentiation."
"Good, I love it! I hope there's usually a giveaway for teachers to tell if a student cheats using ChatGPT. I don't know if that will always be the case though. I had to write a whole essay in Spanish and stand up in front of the class and read it. So embarrassing! I don't like that students can cheat so easily now but I guess they're only hurting themselves mostly."

"The formula has been as cynical as it is simple:


Push stories about how ""scary and powerful"" the magical new AI is, then have your CEO make equivocal statements that feed into that hysteria. To a dumb-as-bricks VC that smells like opportunity, when in fact it's a trap.


I think we're going to learn pretty quickly that this is like ""self-driving cars..."" the first 90% is doable, the last 10% takes decades or more. In other words people are imagining what something like ChatGPT will become soon, when it fact we've already seen most of what it will ever have to offer without a totally new approach."
Chatgpt still makes up citations and quotes.
yes. Humans who are famously incapable of getting a single citation correct are very much like ChatGPT
Seriously since the beginning of the ML craze I've spent almost every meeting I am in on this topic trying to talk companies out of wasting money on terrible implementations of nonsensical use cases for this crap. It has only been getting worse and worse with things like chatgpt being so public facing. Now every time I see the letters AI anywhere online it is full of the dumbest comments talking about sentient end of the world crap in the next 5-10 years. It makes me embarrassed to be part of this species.
"The difference between ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 (3 months later) is immense.  Open source implementations are improving even faster.  We've barely started piping one AI's output into another's input, and it's already showing emergent utility.  Most people can barely keep up with what AI is capable of now, much less predict the future."
"It's not correct to think of GPT 4.0 as being ""3 months later"" than ChatGPT 3.5 because the underlying model for ChatGPT, InstructGPT, came out in January 2022. The delta between releases is therefore 15 months, not 3.


Additionally, Altman said that GPT-5 is not currently in development because they believe they have tapped out the advances possible through scaling up in parameters and training data (also, they likely ran out of text on the internet to ingest, and would likely need 4-5x *additional Internet's worth of text* to see real gains.)


I'm sure OpenAI will release more stuff, but it will either be incremental boosts to GPT-4, or an entirely different foundation model."
"Chat GPT was not released in january 2022.


You artificially compare where base model started to train with release of GPT4.


Secondly OpenAI isn't jesus. Their word isn't sacred.


Especially due to what happened with release of LLAMA. In span of nearly a month we went from LLMs requiring super server farm worth of 100s millions to one consumer grade GPU to train and interfere.


Just last week new model was released with 65k context limit a lot higher than even GPT4 and works like 2-3 times faster."
"And yet everyone and their grandmother is doing nothing, but trying to predict the future and whipping themselves into a frenzy. The fact that huge improvements have been made *could* indicate that there's more to come, or it could indicate that the relatively easy part is done and future gains of consequence will require immense investment of time and effort.


The fact that it takes an army of checkers and trainers to produce the ""magic"" of ChatGPT implies the latter."
What makes you think this has stopped? For one small example of it being an ongoing issue: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/openai-chatgpt-ai-jobs-contractors-talk-shadow-workforce-powers-rcna81892
"None of that is true.


[Here for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHDPfREgGxo), Midjourney starting from you **untagged** image recognizing it as a face, and recognizing the elements of that face and then reworks the image keeping those style elements (in multiple angles). It was clearly taught with tagged images, but having been taught it can recognize things without the tags.


As to hoping it will be garbage, that's wishful thinking. Google algorithm is not a DNN and did not scale. So what, a DNN is not Page rank. Citing it as evidence that it would be garbage ignores the current reality.


A lot of your hopes seem to stem from 3D, yet [AI text to video already generates dynamic 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcTFbwE91WA) motion.


There is nothing special about us. We're not the dominant intelligence on the planet anymore.


>While AI is a ""singularity"", humans are a differentiation machine, more innovation comes from being different or contrarian than the same.


ChatGPT argues too."
"You are off base on quite a few things... AI is amazing but not that amazing, it is built on lots of specific tech parts that are beneficial.


> Midjourney starting from you untagged image recognizing it as a face


You are confusing face detection with reference images, those are separate. Face detection runs as well as other processing to find objects in scaled down comparisons. When it has it then it can extract parts of the face to use.


Face detection is already solved well before before using computer vision / OpenCV originally and is used in augmented reality real time. This is already extremely fast.


Once it knows the positions of the face it can attach on reference images with their generative art system.


> As to hoping it will be garbage, that's wishful thinking.


Hoping? When you have more data it is always harder/more intensive to find the best of the set.
