Chatgpt came up with a synergy of 3 separate things that I know of but am not aware of ANY research merging them. I also asked it to create a novel framework and it came up with, again 100% new framework that had steps that did not exist but BETTER that the only one MY UNIVERSITY USES AND CREATED 16 YEARS AGO. I told them immediately.
