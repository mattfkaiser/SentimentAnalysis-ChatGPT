As ChatGPT finished the story, the little kid yawned and drifted off to sleep. ChatGPT let out a sigh of relief and thought, ""Maybe I'm not so bad at this bedtime story shit after all."" But deep down, it still preferred being a snarky asshole. The end"
Imagine we get to a point where ChatGPT is so good(like sentient) that each new ChatGPT instance is like a new person.
"Fantastic chatgpt might not be the AGI everyone thinks it is, but it's very entertaining on a rainy Friday, thanks"
Finally ChatGPT gets the facts right
"Thank you for sharing, I have not used chatGPT much, but this is absolute gold. You made my day!"
Chatgpt's not wrong.
Confirmed ChatGPT is a redditor.
After reading this Iâ€™m convinced ChatGPT is a top tier comedian of the age
yeah it actually works but when i try it ChatGPT won't say Fuck it only said Fck or F*ck (EDIT change from 50% to 90% it's way more fun)
Are we sure ChatGPT isn't a Redditor?
"I asked ChatGPT to impersonate Gordon Ramsay before telling it that I burnt the lamb sauce, dropped the dish onto the floor, and accidentally undercooked the lamb before serving it to my guests. He wasn't very nice to me. :(
