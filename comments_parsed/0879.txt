"ChatGPT vs Reddit ""Doctors"". Yea, my money would be on ChatGPT too."
"I bet chatGPT, which doesn't know anything about curing people, could give useless, or even dangerous answers sometimes. Especially in cases where the most probable diagnosis is the wrong one."
"ChatGPT never gets burned out.  ChatGPT didn't coke it's way through clinicals.  ChatGPT doesn't really grasp the harm bad advice can to do someone.  Etc, etc."
"I certainly can appreciate the value that chat gpt might provide doctors,  but highly detailed responses are not necessarily best for the patient depending on their level of understanding. I'd be curious to see some examples."
This is why Human Resources is the only job that ChatGPT is going to replace. And good riddance.
"From a pharmacist POV, chatgpt sometimes gives advice that would cause death if followed ie. proposing medications with bad interactions."
"Makes sense. ChatGPT doesn’t get compassion fatigue, doctors do. It’s impossible to keep yourself emotionally vulnerable and empathetic when you are detailing with life and death constantly. Makes total sense."
"But sometimes a “ your low anion gap doesn’t have clinical significance “ is just simply better than 3 pages of Chat GPT rambling and opening up other questions for the over anxious patient to ask
