This is a professor? I would go to the meeting, and completely ignore any conversation about whether your essay was written by ChatGPT until your professor can justify holding a position in higher education while making basic grammatical mistakes.

"ChatGPT is eerily good (flawless?) in terms of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. OP makes a bunch of errors in those areas in their post and subsequent comments. And any person who writes with perfect grammar etc. will have some writing **style** that I've never seen in AI-written text: humor, rhetorical questions, parentheticals, some sense of originality.
