now that chatgpt came out. i can really see how that guy was an expert because the masses of the internet are even dumber with chatgpt with all these wild theories and beliefs that it'll solve everything. it really made me lose faith in alot of retards. yes chatgpt is 'advanced' as in AI but it needs a shit ton of work that'll take years maybe another decade to do.
