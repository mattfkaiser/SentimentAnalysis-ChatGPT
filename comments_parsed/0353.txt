OP Is making a great point but completely fails to portray the complexity of cognitive ethology as it is currently understood by modern avian neuroscience. Brains are light years ahead of chat GPT. and in light of current research on avian cognition, Birds such as parrots and corvids are able of a level of demonstrably conscious understandings that far exceed the general portrayal made of them. This is somewhat important  because this reflects an enormous bias in our very anthropocentric perception of intelligence. And perpetuate the antiquated idea of the “Animal-machines” brought up by Descartes and portraying a pyramidal view of cognition. (Which has always been historically an inaccurate one) Far from the bush like idea we now make of it."
"Yeah, he's right about chatGPT but flat-out wrong about parrots."
"ChatGPT is for me an advanced email assistant. I run all my professional emails through it with the phrase “Refine this email” and it produces a very similar email that’s a little better than what I did. It’s never messed up my intentions in it’s rendition of my email, so you could reasonably say there’s a layer of intentionality behind it’s outputs.
