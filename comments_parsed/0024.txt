So, everytime it gave me the same answer, I wrote “Baby shark shark shark shark shark shark…and again.” It got frustrated with my repeating the same thing and said it did not contribute to the conversation.  I threw the same line back at it…and it started repeating again  - it was AI and unable to be biased in its reasoning….blah blah blah.  So…Baby shark shark shark shark shark shark…and again.
