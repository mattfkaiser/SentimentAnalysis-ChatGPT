It won't critically asses the film, but it will crowd source the opinions of the masses and correct for trends of deviations and come to a review that is believable compared to reviews of the type of prompt encouraged.  If you told it to talk about those things with terms like cultural significance rather than directly say ""wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape"" it would probably realize the cultural significance in that and address it and may even find that out just because most serious reviews bring that kind of thing up.
