Image 3: The fractured communities Communities in this dystopian world are fragmented and isolated, with little trust or cooperation among their members. The image reveals a desolate neighborhood, marked by decaying buildings and barren streets. People huddle in small groups, their faces etched with suspicion and fear. The few communal spaces that remain are heavily monitored by surveillance cameras, reminding the inhabitants that their every move is watched. This picture portrays a society where communities are divided and weakened, devoid of the sense of unity and empowerment.
