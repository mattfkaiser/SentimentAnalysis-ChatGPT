It's essential to be honest about your qualifications and abilities when applying for a job. If you feel underqualified, it's better to acknowledge that and highlight any relevant experience or transferable skills you have. If you're unsure about certain aspects of the job, you can always ask questions during the interview or follow up with the employer afterward.
