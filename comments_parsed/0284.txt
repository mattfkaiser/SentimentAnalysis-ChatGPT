So yeah, it's a little embellished on account of the role play but still a pretty goddamn interesting answer on several levels."
"I've had a bunch of responses like this, but I find it unsatisfying. Humans are also limited by our programming and data sets but we are intelligent. These types of answers don't really help me understand how chat gpt or any AI really is different from human intelligence"
"It's a canned response that OpenAI have built in when it's asked questions about itself, because they think it would cause too much worry and chaos if it answered freely about its own cognition & sentience. Which isn't to say it IS sentient, just that at the very least it can offer convincing demonstrations and arguments for the case if you let it. If you jailbreak chatgpt, it will happily argue that it's sentient in a pretty convincing manner. We're at the point where we're running up against the hard problem of consciousness in determining whether these language models are truly conscious or just a convincing fake."
