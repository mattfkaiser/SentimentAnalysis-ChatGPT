Just wait until two people are both using ChatGPT messaging each other.  Robots dating robots.
"I think that's the point. I think most people on reddit enjoy being anonymous and therefore are more honest and all parts of personality could be analyzed with AI. But still every user should have it in their own hand to connect their profile to Reddit or any social media they have. AI is a big privacy debate, otherwise ChatGPT wouldn't be banned in Italy already."
Don't bother building the app. ChatGPT will do it anyway.
"ChatGPT would date itself, get laid and produce little ChatGPTinhos and ChatGPTinhas for you to feed training data to."
"I just gave ChatGPT4 this prompt: ""Write a romcom movie summary about a world where people use bots to go on simulated dates with each before meeting in real life, but then the bots start scheming to find people who are actually the opposite of a good match, then hijinks ensue and it turns out the couples actually fall in love anyway.""
