Every time there’s a new revision, the first thing I do is ask it “Do you know what Talislanta is?” It always replies with the Wikipedia information… it’s a RPG that first came out in the late 80s, by Bard Games, written by Stephen Sechi, yada yada. Then I ask it “Do you know the races of Talislanta?” (This information is NOT in Wikipedia.) It says yes, and gives me a made-up list of races, with one or two that are actually in the game.
