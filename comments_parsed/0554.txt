Tell-tale signs of cheating for me are when a student gets super defensive/argumentative, changes their story a lot, gets red or shows other signs of nervousness, or eagerly accepts the opportunity to redo the assignment (if it was the student's original work in the first place, why would they be so eager to rewrite it?).
