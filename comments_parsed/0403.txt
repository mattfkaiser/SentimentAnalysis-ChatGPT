It's been said that we stand on the shoulder of giants and it comes to a question of how much of our opinions aren't just the same mechanism with meat running the electrical systems.  I mean, to a degree, that is literally what education is for people.  We expose them to information and teach them how to find what information is relevant and then we produce good answers given the data set we've been given.  If we're really well educated, we'll be taught how to expand our data set.
