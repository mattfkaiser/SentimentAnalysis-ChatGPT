"Haha absolutely. I have an app called Jumpcut which you can use on jumpcut.app or as a Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jumpcut/jicbaeklgoninplhmenhndnidnbfaohm


It allows you to make shortened versions of YouTube videos (and chapters from comments, or watch just the top comments) any way you want, and then share it so it only plays the part you are talking about for the people who watch with your link.


ChatGPT will do the shortening automatically now."
I want to create some sort of format where regular people can use ChatGPT without all the prompts etc to interview their favorite celebrity or idol. Is that something plug ins could do?
"Do you know by any chance if there are any plugins that would make it possible to use chatgpt with the access to the internet? I don't have internet access on my gpt4 version.


For my project, I need to find if a youtube video from one channel is similar to any video on another youtube channel (maybe using transcription). Doing all that manually is like looking for a needle in a  haystack. thanks in advance, I liked your post!"
"Thank you for replying! I know it’s hard, but if I really wanted to compare the context of 1 video to the context of like 1k+ others, how would I go about it? Could the actual chatgpt4 with the internet access(that a few people have) potentially do that? Is there any other realistic solution?"
"ChatGPT allowed me to fill many backend stacks. I only made the client part, but if i tell this code, gpt made a backend code. It's insane!"
"I only started yesterday and was only able to get ChatGPT to interact with it today, so it remains to be seen haha.


The error correction is crazy. Basically ChatGPT tried creating a query and received an error code like ""expected an object instead of an array"", it assumed it made a mistake and tried to format the data differently multiple times. I stopped it after a few times not wanting to get flagged as it couldn't really fix it - it was my mistake in an API definition.


It's certainly not perfect, but having these capabilities at such an early phase of the technology is very exciting for me."
"I don't understand this perspective.


If someone replaced all fast food cashiers tomorrow with ChatGPTs, would it not be ""just another layer of abstraction""?


The fact you can abstract away something an engineer would do is insane.


And yes, sometimes it makes mistakes. Humans do that too right? And this is the second version of this technology, you don't think that will ever improve? I certainly do."
"Mmh I tend to pride myself on holding most of my takes in the spectrum of 'reasonable' (at least outwardly, if I don't seem to have a strong opinion either way I might sometimes just be avoiding an argument. But don't tell anyone!).


On one hand I have coded enough to be wary of any unvetted code. On the other, well, I am aware of just how fast the tech is advancing. Who's to say that chatGPT won't be able to test self-written code on its own with acceptable precision. And I do think that such a tool is possible (I did specify ""foreseeable"" after all which now that I think about it is a bad word because I can literally see a future where it is not true... damn you 'words having a set meaning and not being able to just use one that feels good').


Regarding downvotes... Karma is worthless yes, which is why whenever I comment about them it's more about the intention behind the action. It's disheartening to see perfectly good comments being told ""this is not relevant / I wish to not see this"" if that makes sense?"
Ask chat GPT?
Serious question.. this sounds like you’re using it as a router? If so that would be crazy expensive at scale unless you run your own LLM and don’t have to pay for Chat GPT credits. Am I understanding this right?
"If someone gives prompts to chatGPT and creates a plugin to make video clips from YouTube, does that person understand how the YouTube API works? Does that person understand what the relevant parts of the videos are? How do you know the answers to those questions?"
Why does chatGPT predict symbols based on the symbols provided to it? Why does it not choose to simply not respond?
"Denial is the failure to understand the tool being used and attribute it to magic or thinking its model understands things it clearly doesn't. ChatGPT is quite useful, but it doesn't understand anything."
You can probably create a ChatGPT plugin  tutorial?
"No, at the moment ChatGPT has no access to the video transcripts any other way, and can't send a request to my service.


Even with the upcoming ""browsing"" mode, it is only allowed to search."
"Hey ! How does it actually work now :) ? Are plugins creation available to all chatGPTPlus subscribers ?




Would like to try to create one too, i'm a developper with a few years of experience :)"
"I'm a noob, so I'll just ask: is this about making webhooks? I'm wondering if I can have ChatGPT making webhooks for me? I have two systems; one where all the action happens ans one where I store data and use it. I want to habe system 1 make system 2 know that X has happened and therefore tell system 2 to update a specific client or whatever.


Is that possible without involving a developer?"
"I have a question: are the only chatgpt plugins availble those that are listed on gpt-4 browser interface, or are there additional ones that one could use?"
"My plugin is based on my app Jumpcut (www.jumpcut.app and Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jumpcut/jicbaeklgoninplhmenhndnidnbfaohm ), it allows users to take a YouTube video and create a shortened version of it that you can share with others. They will only watch the parts you marked and it will auto-skip everything else. It can be used for highlights, 15-minute versions, customized edits (only show Messi goals in a video, etc.) , or anything else you feel like doing.


ChatGPT allows users to create automated cuts instead of doing the manual work themselves!"
He prolly can't write better than chatGPT
Perhaps chatgpt should replace the writers of this shitty article?
That's been what the media does for years. Tv and movie dislogue is absolute shit too. They should all absolutely be replaced by chatgpt. They provide nothing of value.
Best use I got from chat gpt is asking it to write me a cover letter for a job in the style of Dostoevsky. I've never laughed harder. Like it's not great but it's surface level passable when you add a style on top of it
"I’ve been feeding chatgpt my self-written cover letter as a template and asking it to re-write it to match various job descriptions.


It’s taken a lot of the work out of the application processes (but also fuck cover letters in general) and landed me some early stage interviews just because it optimises the keywords the systems are looking for."
"The thing is, chat gpt CAN create amazing things. If a skilled writer knows how to put a prompt. Honestly it's a great tool for writing, but its only as good as the person using it."
"I do agree with the basic sentiment, but I think you are generalising too much. AI would be able to print those Marvel & DC movies in three years at best, but it will probably take dozens of years to produce something akin to Parasite or Triangle of Sadness. Those movies aren't produced because their producers aren't interested in making money, instead, they understand that formulaic movies wouldn't cut it in their situation. They have less money, and less star studded cast. Plus, Marvel and DC are already there and a new competitor would most likely sink said competitor. Most movies are not Parasite or Triangle of Sadness, but arguably, they are trying to be something different. ChatGPT is not replacing movie writers."
"We fundamentally agree that generative AI is not creative.


But the vast, vast bulk of people who write stuff for a living *aren’t* writing screenplays and big umbrella “creative writing,” they’re writing technical documentation, emails, ad copy for boring shit, PowerPoint presentations for their boss, shareholder documents that have to be dry as fuck. There are writers who are valued for their LACK of creative expression and emotion. Those people are fucking thrilled to offload to ChatGPT.


Painting *all* generative AI as “input prompt, receive product” is selling it short (and overselling it, ironically, because those outputs aren’t great).


Even if you *are* a purely creative writer, generative AI can be extremely useful for summarising the stuff you might be researching to integrate into your own work, validating tone and style goals, and so on. Some of the stuff that a lot of otherwise very good writers find challenging can be easily unblocked.


Related question: Do you use Grammarly at all? Autocorrect on your phone? Spellcheck in Word/Google Docs? All of those are [nowadays] forms of “AI” (because generative AI is not actually AI in the true sense)."
"Right so I deliberately used the term robot because obviously this is not true AI. However I think the comparison of chatGPT to autocorrect or spellcheck is a dubious argument. Like photoshop they are merely tools with which to make art on your own. Correcting your grammar isnt doing the work for you. Like I said, I see the use for copy writers. I never said that this technology has zero applications. All I'm saying is that if you use chatGPT to write the bulk of your screenplay, novel, play or whatever else, you are effectively no longer an artist. And taking pride in that chat bot's output would be pathetic. I feel the same way about dudes on art station with nothing but generated images. That's not your artistic output, writing the prompt means nothing to me."
I've played around with ChatGPT.  I can confidently say it will be extremely successful at replacing the writers of Manifest and woefully inadequate at replicating Reacher.
"I’ve asked ChatGPT to write scripts.


This would lead to some very poor quality television"
"Instead of having 10 writers churning out a script.  You'll have 2, rewriting whatever ChatGPT spews out"
I watched YouTube where the guy had ChatGPT write 3 scripts that he filmed. They were nonsense. Random shit happened and characters said off the wall shit for no reason. It was hilariously bad.
"You know, there ought to be a sub for LLM success stories. As a professional programmer I find it ridiculous when someone suggests that chatGPT can replace us. But chatGPT can certainly make me more productive.


I'd be interested in reading how LLMs are making people better at their jobs."
"In my field, and I think this applies to many fields, people fear that even if the best chatGPT can do is make programmers more efficient, and not replace them entirely, the company will hire fewer programmers or even let some go. Like, if each programmer can do the work of 1.5 programmers now we can get the work of 3 old programmers from 2 new chatGPT enhanced programmers.


Much of software dev is making tradeoffs. We look at all the things we want to do and pare down the list to what we think we can get done.


If programmers get more capable we don't use less of them, we just move more items from our wish list to our doing list."
"At current state, chatGPT has the capacity to assemble together things it has been trained on. It doesn’t show creativity. Anything created like that would be something already seen, one way or the other. If all humanity stopped producing content right now to let chatGPT do it, we’ll be out of novelty in a matter of months"
"I tried to use Chat GPT to write an episode of Columbo…


It did not go well.


If they don’t get a deal with the writers expect to see American Gladiators back on the air."
"I've used chatgpt to write episodes of Seinfeld that were not horrible, but you could write a Seinfeld episode about anything and make it work"
"ChatGPT is not capable of reasoning, it just guesses very well the best order of words based on the ones you wrote, but it has no idea what you're talking about and doesn't have any logic, just a big database and a very good training to guess the best possible sentence.
So this is very stupid, because it wouldn't create anything good, it would just mix together already existing stuff and nothing would be new. We'd end up with Harry Potter creating magic drugs for SpongeBob or something like that."
"Lmao. Please do it. So you learn the hard way when google sandboxes your entire news organization for using trash chatgpt articles. Or when people laugh at your movie scripts because they sound repetitive and lame as hell.


Chatgpt isn’t creative. It’s a word spinning tool."
The way conservative idiots eat up the shitty chat gpt scripts really shows how uncreative and stupid they all are.
ChatGPT is honestly bad at writing anything powerful
"My work has an internal-only tool that’s similar to chat GPT. It sees what you’re coding and suggests the next line. It’s pretty good at handling boilerplate no-brain stuff, but it has no ability to creatively solve a problem."
i think we should replace corporate officers with chatgpt
For some reason everyone talks about chat GPT but they don't know about how it was developed to lie and give false data.
"ChatGPT can be used for picking stocks (by by hedge fund managers), received better outcomes than doctors, writing code....the question remains....who's going to compensate the workers whose jobs are taken from them? So far the companies kick the can to the taxpayers. That won't be sustainable. Manual labor jobs will be the only jobs not touched by this round of technology."
But chatgpt is crap at doing that. Which bug brain suggested this?
Anyone who thinks that ChatGPT could replace writers deserves to watch season after season of AI generated sitcoms.
If ChatGPT took over for writers every show would be the Eric Andre Show
"I'd say ""do it, because that shit would be funny"" but then I remembered most people have worse grammar and ideas that ChatGPT when writing anyway.


That was a run-on sentence, how many people honestly noticed?"
"I noticed. I also noticed the that instead of than.


The people using chatGPT to scab the writers are probably to cheap to go for the paid version of chatGPT so we'll be left with content generated by the 3.5 version instead of the improved 4.0 version.


This will be great."
"Maybe chat GPT will come up with something original.  Unlike what has been done for the last 20 years. Just reboots, remakes, prequels and sequels 🙄"
If they adopt this then it will most likely be chatgpt writing the scripts with people to go over them to make sure they're not absolute dogshit. Most likely lowering the demand for writers in the industry all together.
"A few people putting prompts into ChatGPT could easily replace *hundreds* of professional writers?


Ridiculous take."
"Actually they should ahead. Chatgpt is very good at many things but jokes and comedy timming is not one of them.


This would be a great time to show that to the world."
"Get rid of them.


I bet chatgpt cliche tv show would be great to watch.


Also replace the crappy acting.


And then maybe some improv comedians will have some new material. It's a shame these crsppy late night comedians cant think for themselves and need a teleprompter"
I’m not gonna believe in the great ChatGPT replacement until it can do an hour of standup and get laughs the whole time. That’s the real Turing test.
"Honestly if I found out a show was written by chatgpt, I’d actively boycott the whole franchise"
Honestly. Let them use chat gpt and they’ll learn it fucking sucks hard at humor and now all there money is gone.
"Sorry but isn’t the whole anti-work concept predicated on society not needing human labor, thus making work optional?  Obviously ChatGpt can’t replace writers, but wouldn’t using AI to replace workers be desirable?"
I really want them to take ChatGPT and specialize it towards special education. It already writes better IEPs and better goals than many I recieve with my students. And it's a great tool to personalize goals. Just need to make it compliant.
I really want to start utilizing ChatGPT to write my own IEPs. A neighboring district actually had a professional development on how to use it appropriately and specifically for IEPs.
"I use it successfully with student PLOPs, and any summaries as needed.  I have also prompted the summaries to include specific accommodations, modifications.  The key is to prompt it with positive tone, and as if it was a special Ed teacher.  Be weary not to use any specific student information other than first names.  We are many years away from ChatGPT to be included into FERPA, but having the ethics and good faith is a first step."
"I'm a SPED Para and I find ChatGPT is a great tool for our kids. Granted, I don't let them just get on it whenever, I'm usually the one typing prompts, but it helps immensely when writing"
Shouldn't you not put private information into Chat GPT? There was a situation a couple of months ago where Chat gpt was spitting out private details users had put into it.
"Do you find it faster than using a text expander? Also, are you using just the free version of chat gpt or are you using a higher tier?"
"Yes agreed: If anyone needs an introduction to how ChatGPT can be used in the classroom, especially for admin - read this: https://www.chatgptguide.ai/2023/04/30/how-to-use-chatgpt-as-a-teacher-in-the-early-years-classroom/"
"Here's what I've used it for:


- generating a list and definitions of key vocabulary for a topic.


- making an analogy or metaphor to explain a certain concept (then ""dumbing down"" the analogy even further.


- summarise the key takeaways from behaviour management and/or self improvement books that I wanted to read but was never going to.


- making a plan for a topic based on me inputting what I want them to achieve by the end of it,  what year group / skill level they are currently at, and how many lessons they will have (eg 8 x 50minute lessons)... This serves as a starting point for planning out a topic that I then shuffle about and populate with actual content.


- making quizzes and cloze passages quickly.


- suggesting long answer questions and giving me the answers (which I then check for accuracy before refining and handing out).


- fleshing out the feedback based on dot points I've jotted down about a student's performance in a task.


- generating emails that I have the gist of in my head but not the brain capacity to think about (for example, giving chatgpt dot points of what I want to say, the context, and whether it is formal or not). Then proofreading because chatgpt's tone is God awful.


- formatting things that I copy and paste into chatgpt  such as putting information into a table.


- listening and formatting information such as lessons, lesson number, the key vocab, what skill is being targeted etc into a table. I will teach the lessons, but run out of time because those in charge want a very specific blow by blow of what I am doing. This speeds it up.


- asking it to summarise a topic I am unfamiliar with. Then checking for accuracy. Always need to check for accuracy.


- just throwing out random ideas for revision games based on context, such as, using flashcards, only 10 minutes, shy students, limited space, outdoors with no resources etc.


- writing a short children's story that teaches a key concept or utilises it in some way.


- generating debate prompts.


Frankly, it takes away so much work that is just taxing on the brain and behind the scenes stuff. *Never* do I use it to teach literally, or grade. That would be too much.


But for the stuff where I just need an assistant to do the research, proofreading, coming up with ideas, or fleshing out text that I have dot points for, it is brilliant.


It can take off your hands the exact things that teachers always complain (rightfully) about having to do, that takes away from the actual teaching.


But hey, if some teachers don't want to use it, that's their business and good luck with that."
"I just started using it for my lessons a few weeks ago. It's an awesome tool for coming up with  ideas for how to teach certain concepts and topics, and also how to explain things in different ways. I usually ask it something like, ""How would you teach \_\_\_\_\_ to a (grade level / subject) class?""


I don't copy what it says verbatim, but it definitely gives a good starting point and can give you a good framework for your lessons. Some of my colleagues also use it to respond to emails from parents. I've also used it to create tests (takes 2 seconds with chatgpt, takes me 2 hours on my own).


Some people are against it but I say it's available, it's effective, so why not use it? It's saving me a lot of time and energy that I can spend doing the million other things we have on our plates."
Ask ChatGpt
"I just asked ChatGPT for ideas for this problem. It’s answer:


“Creating assignments that students cannot use AI to complete can be challenging, as AI tools like ChatGPT have become quite powerful. However, it is possible to design ELA (English Language Arts) assignments that are more resistant to AI assistance by focusing on activities that require personal reflection, creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. Here are some suggestions:


Personal Reflection Journal: Encourage students to write about their own experiences and emotions, which AI tools cannot replicate.


Group Projects: Assign collaborative tasks that involve discussions, debates, or group writing activities, making it more challenging for AI to contribute.


Class Presentations: Require students to deliver oral presentations on a topic, with a focus on their delivery, body language, and ability to respond to questions from their peers.


Creative Writing with Specific Constraints: Assign creative writing prompts that include unique or personal elements that AI tools would not be able to generate.


Peer Editing and Review: Have students provide feedback on each other's work, promoting critical thinking and collaboration.


Socratic Seminars: Conduct in-class discussions or debates that require active participation, critical thinking, and analysis of text or ideas.


Multimodal Projects: Assign projects that incorporate various media formats (such as videos, podcasts, or artwork) to explore a topic or text, making it more difficult for AI to contribute.


Ethical Discussions: Engage students in discussions about the ethical implications of AI usage in academics and beyond, fostering a greater understanding of AI's limitations and potential risks.


Keep in mind that no assignment can be entirely AI-proof, but these suggestions should encourage deeper engagement and critical thinking from students, making it less likely that AI can complete the task.”"
"This is a much better list than the last few that ChatGPT spewed out (which was a list of things I’ve personally seen it do even though it says it can’t).


Thanks for posting this!"
Ugh. ChatGPT is a *that guy.*
"There's a few small workarounds, but these would be my first thoughts:


1) You can run the essays through ""AI checkers"". AI does actually have a pretty predictable style, because...it's using predictive ""best fit"" words to write. Have students keep submitting until their essays are less than 50% likely to be written by AI.


2) The *free* version of ChatGPT has a cutoff for facts/internet (Sept 2021). Incorporate facts or prompts on information after this date and you can just fact check them. An AI will ""hallucinate"" (make up) information that is incorrect to fill in gaps, whereas a human would actually research.


3) Handwritten submissions"
"They just don’t copy and paste it.


They have the ChatGPT in one window and their Google Doc in another. They write it themselves, word for word, rather than copy/paste. It shows an edit history and I’m left with no solid proof of cheating."
ChatGPT is pretty great at grading essays and writing tailored feedback as well.
"ChatGPT actually uses ""tokens"" instead of words. The free version has a token limit of 4096. Some words are multiple tokens, so a good rule of thumb for essays is a 3,000 word chunk at a time. You can play with how tokens work [here](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).


Of course, I have a hard time getting my kids to write 500 lol. But it is great for long form test question grading, especially if you feed it a rubric."
"If anyone reading this post has a problem with using ChatGPT this way, answer this: do you Google ideas for lessons or activities (or buy them from TPT) and modify them for your own use?


If you do, then you are doing the exact same thing OP is doing.


(As with everything you don't create yourself, ALWAYS review ChatGPT's output to make sure it is useful for what you want to do in the classroom.)"
"I feel like this is a really good point...


Most plagiarism detection software already has or will have chatgpt detection built into it... I think for lesson plans and prep work that won't see the light of day it is fine; however,  I feel like we need to be careful as professionals if we use CHAT GPT in any capacity with which our work can be checked with any kind of plagiarism detection software..


I might be in the minority here, but it is just my 2 cents..."
"I give 0s for chatgpt work (high school English). It’s not their thoughts. Even if they use it as a jumping off point, it’s not THEIR analysis or necessarily even their synthesis so. Essentially plagiarism in my mind 🤷‍♀️"
"Yep. That's completely fair on your end. I think as they get older they'll use it as a jumping-off point. But right now it's the ""Oh teachers don't know what ChatGPT is. I can get away with just copying/pasting that response."" phase."
"Honestly? Its a word calculator. I look at it like math teachers view their calculators. The student uses their tools effectively to reach the desired answer faster. We assume the student can do the division, the multiplication, etc. What they cant do is the higher order equations. That is where the learning is happening.


If im judging their ability to write, chat gpt is a calculator and isnt allowed on the test. If im looking for a product that requires text as only a small component, like a multi-media or multi-modal project than of course the gpt calculator is allowed."
"This is an excellent way to frame it. I've used ChatGPT to help me come up with ways to frame and organize things. I also showed my students that yes, this can write an essay for you in under a minute but unless you ask it for the specifications that I have, and it struggled with the specifications I asked for it to include, that your essay will not meet the requirements. I only had two students out of 126 use AI to write their essay for them. The rest either did it or plagiarized off of each other and websites."
"So far it is significantly inferior to ChatGPT. But the difference with Google is that I've been doing EVERYTHING with Google- searching, researching, writing, computing, budgeting, creating, texting, listening to music, etc- for 15 years or more.


If they are able to use ALL OF THAT to make me a *personalized* AI program as powerful as something like ChatGPT, where I can tell it to structure an essay or send a text, and it does either one appropriately and in my own voice, then that would be next level"
I use chatGPT for research!  I'm compiling a list of nobel laureate scientists that are POC and it was useful to get all that info in one place.
"If all you want is some boilerplate, generic starting point that may or may not actually be accurate or accomplish what you want it to, go nuts with ChatGPT.  It’s good for automating busywork.


All it does is a glorified Google search that processes and plugs in bits of language based on keywords to sound coherent.  It does not have the ability to think creatively or even insightfully, unless it can find someone else’s creativity or insight to copy."
"We should be, but IME the people who rely on ChatGPT to do their writing for them barely even bother to proofread it.  You’re not much of a driver if you don’t even look at the road in front of you."
"I bet those same people aren’t much of a teacher without ChatGPT either. This is nothing more than a tool to help, it doesn’t solve all issues. A good teacher will use it well. A poor teacher may not be improved by it."
ChatGPT to the rescue :)
"https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/how-to-use-chatgpt/


It’s free for now in a limited form. How limited is ever evolving. There are upgrade options."
"Chat Sonic, ChatGPT, or Bard. Which is your first choice and why?


[Edited - typo - ""first"" not ""fist""]"
Chat GPT is blocked in my district
I feel like an old guy reading about chatgpt. How can I access this? Is it an app for the smart phone? A website?
"ChatGPT in a way is a glorified search engine that cuts back SO much time sifting through google pages and articles to get what you need. There is no need for the hate. Don’t even worry about the naysayers. There have been people afraid of new technology for millennia and if we listened to them we’d never have A/C, minivans, or electricity ."
"I don’t have issues with Chat GPT for some things, but I absolutely object to it being used for personalized information. I was talking with my students about letters of recommendation, for example, and they said they would be upset/hurt to find out a teacher used AI instead of writing the letter themselves. Same goes for any sort of observation, I want the personal touch, even if it’s misspelled or has grammar issues. I think that using it to set up assignments or basic stuff is ok, but really, I think the whole issue is going to be figuring out how to use it helpfully while not using it to do our entire job. Otherwise, let’s just go back online and let the computers do all the work. Sadly, not /s, I think there are huge elements of the population that want exactly this."
"I tried to use it to write a test for my advanced class. Multiple choice. Every answer it provided was wrong.  It doesn't know enough chemistry to make it useful - I can write tests way faster than it can, and mine will be correct.


I don't do any of the other things you listed, so ChatGPT is pointless for me."
"Welcome to 2023 ... teachers bragging how to use ChatGPT, but getting upset when their students want to use it too. :)"
"How is the teacher expecting to get paid in full when students can also just watch YouTube videos and chat with ChatGPT.


Sidenotice: often those online videos are explaining better than actual teachers."
"I lead professional development workshops and one of my most requested topics as of late has been ChatGPT for teachers. It certainly does not replace everything, but can make teachers lives SO much easier by streamlining mundane tasks, assisting with accommodations/modifications, making email/newsletter templates, crafting writing prompts, developing lesson plans…and more.


It’s an incredible tool. But it is, just a tool. As has been posted here. Take what is given as a draft and revise as appropriate.


I also have a 5 hour Udemy course called ChatGPT for Teachers: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying Life. My course currently has students from 6 continents and 18 countries enrolled! If you’re interested in checking it out, the link is in my bio."
"My problem with chatgpt is that it has potential to erase any and all human thinking.   Will this have an effect on human ability to self problem solve?   What happens when we cease to use our brains and rely on a computer?


Other than that, yeah it frees up a lot of time.  But instead of using my brain, I'm filling it with garbage elsewhere on the internet."
"I'm still on the fence about this sort of thing. I'm sure you don't mean that you let ChatGPT do every single thing, but what value do you feel like you're adding to your own classroom?"
"So I'm not trying to sound snarky, but I'm often successful anyway.....


If you teach math out of an Algebra book, what value are you adding to the classroom?


Reading TKAM? With handouts from the English textbook? Same question.


The value is not in the material or the planning. It never has been. Those are just tools to help us reach the goal. Teachers are the mechanics, the drivers, the \[choose your metaphor..... or is it an analogy??? Who knows, I'm just a math teacher who loves ChatGPT\]."
"Sufficiently motivated students can learn most things on their own with premade lectures and learning material.


Teachers are there to provide motivation and manage behavior. ChatGPT isn't changing that."
I don't use ChatGPT to do everything. I use it as a base and then sculpt it a bit further.
"Listen I am too old to use Chat GPT at this time. But don't sell yourself short about what you do. An effective teacher does much more than write lesson plans. Heck there are plenty of great lesson plans already available for any lesson you teach. An effective teacher clearly explains, helps and guides students. They manage the environment and provide interventions when needed. Only one part of what we do is plan and its not even the biggest part."
"I promise you, if you can interact with a human on reddit, you can use ChatGPT. It really is that simple. Ask it to do something, wait a few seconds, take what it gives you and edit it a bit to suit your needs."
"I've used chatgpt for a few things. Your job is telling it what to write, then editing it to follow your parameters."
"maybe we’ve had different experiences, I’ve always been told that LORs are one of the most important parts of an application. I remember freaking tf out over mine, if a teacher had used ChatGPT I’d be extremely upset.
obv you’re not responsible for your students emotions, but if they knew you were using ChatGPT to write them, I’d think many of them wouldn’t want to ask you.
again, maybe we’ve just had different experiences, but for me an LOR is so drastically different than anything else u described. but honestly the rest is a very good idea!! I could see it being really helpful"
"I understand the concern here bc honestly my gut reaction to thought of using chatGPT for LORs is very, uh, negative. But I know that teachers/professors who get lots of LOR requests are most likely working from some sort of template anyway, so I guess as long as they're taking the time to customize it it's not that big a deal?


Like if they just filled out a template they found online and sent it off, I'd be just as pissed as if they just sent whatever chatGPT spat out."
This is definitely the case. Generic LORs whether they are through ChatGPT or an online template are not great
"Yeah, that’s kind of what I though. Kind of makes me sad, an LOR is supposed to be personal, and it’s very important to the student. Like, everything else they listed is an excellent use of ChatGPT. But with the LORs… that just makes me sad."
Because the end result is an ourobous of ChatGPT. Teachers use chat to create the assignments; student use it to answer the assignments; those assignments are then graded by the same AI.
"We all stand on the shoulders of the giants that came before us.


Of ChatGPT assistance helps one to teach better and be a better teacher, it's unethical not to use it."
"Teachers are magpies, as they should be. Everyone borrows from each other to keep building better and better material. Chat GPT helps more people access more content and then choose the best of it."
I’m so done this year. ChatGPT is currently writing all my email responses and student referrals.
"Im a scientist who uses programming regularly in my work. I use ChatGPT every single day, everyone I know does. It’s no more cheating than using a calculator or a word processor that checks your spelling and grammar."
I saw someone recommend to use chatgpt to help write emails to parents. My husband and I recently used it to reject a couple contractors that were bidding on quotes. My life has been made so much simpler now!
Rubrics. How good are the ones from ChatGPT? I already have my own. They are OK. Will I improve?
"I love chatGPT also.


I have gone from ""research"" mode to ""assistant"" mode.


It is very good at understanding texts and enriching them.  We also have a private instance that is trained on ""specific work topics"" and i love it. The only issue I have is that it is hallucinating a few times still.


I have ""special requests"" to set it up correctly before pasting the text i need it to work on."
"What if this entire thread (the OP, the comments, this comment) were all written by ChatGPT?


How would that make you feel?"
"I'll admit I'm slow to the game....I don't know \*\*how\*\* to use ChatGPT!!


A useful PD? Yeah, would be. Have we had it? NOT A FUCKING CHANCE. Why not? Admin doesn't have a goddamned clue WTF it is...*but teachers are already using it.*


Just... not me."
"I agree with you. AI is taking a lot of the cognitive load off. I did, however, observe that asking it to create a cryptographic puzzle for a learning experience I’m putting together yielded mixed results. The key provided by chatGPT did not function. I’m going to keep playing around with it."
ChatGPT is the only reason I'm considering going back into the classroom at this point.
"The following submission statement was provided by /u/blueberryman422:


---


Now that AI is going mainstream, the whole idea of freelancing as a backup career option is not looking very promising anymore. There’s a lot of people that would freelance to supplement income or fill an employment gap and if those opportunities are no longer available, there is going to be a lot of people that can’t find work very soon.

Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12uepfw/ive_never_hired_a_writer_better_than_chatgpt_how/jh6iwcw/"
"""ChatGPT is better than my bottom of the barrel freelancers"" is like saying that a Wikipedia article has a more in-depth knowledge about Emperor Kangxi's conquests than the high schooler staffing the McDonald's drive-through.


""$22/hr"" is a translation for ""I pay about $40 for a a 300-500 word fluff article to bulk out my website."" These sort of low-rent clients abound. Source? I used to work on upwork. It's miserable, as no one really wants to pay, and actual ""talent"" quickly becomes unaffordable as quality clients both pay better and provide enough work to keep them busy."
"I work in content development and chatgpt writes unusable content for anything other than a click farm that doesn’t care about the actual quality at all. I would never let content the AI writes go straight to readers. Gpt is good for in-house outlines and things like that but not actual site content, even bottom of the barrel rates will get you much better writers. This headline is a bold faced lie"
"Freelance writer here, I've tried using ChatGPT to generate output, and the amount of time I have to spend fixing its middle school writing style exceeds the time it takes to just write it well myself.


This also doesn't account for all the times ChatGPT states something that is factually and demonstrably *wrong* with utter confidence."
">Gpt is good for in-house outlines and things like that but not actual site content, even bottom of the barrel rates will get you much better writers. This headline is a bold faced lie


This has been my experience in technical writing. I asked ChatGPT to document a basic Windows 10 maintenance procedure I had just got done writing myself. ChatGPT spit out an article with a similar structure as mine, but it was like a high level outline - it was entirely devoid of specific and necessary detail, which I knew would not work for the audience of non-technical users this article was written for"
"it might be that you didnt use gpt4 or they intentionally nerfed it. i remember when chatgpt first came out, the writing was insanely good. now the free version is kinda bad. i havent used the paid version which is gpt4."
"What do you mean by training it? Using your own data to additionally train on the model? Or just adding some kind of persona/rules to the prompt. As far as I know, gpt-4 still struggles with forgetfulness(much better than 3.5, but still exists) and still struggles with hallucinations (slightly better than 3.5).




FRom my personal experience, the biggest issue with GPT based outputs is that it is unreliable for complex stuffs. So you need to think of the whole problem as a human, but use it to do all the simpler smaller task to increase your productivity, as for the future, I think GPT-5 and likes will be very expensive to run, making the business model maybe not that viable.






Potential diminishing returns on feature size also makes it harder on future GPT product(a.k.a you can't just add 100 gazillion feature size and it is thousand or million times less likely to make hallucinations ). Also legal issue(e.g platforms like stack overflow is not liking chatgpt data collecting without paying them money) are making future developments of GPT like service kinda in gray area?


Be ready to pivot and use the AI tools to boost your productivity , but I think it is not at that stage yet, we don't know whether GPT technology is the right architecture/model to reach AGI, so no need to panic just yet"
Confidently wrong. Is this written by ChatGPT?
"The last post is chatGPT. I didn't say GPT out of the box was good, just that it is very powerful. You can tailor it to needs.




\>. I think AI writing is good at fooling non-writers but anybody who has to parse content regularly on a professional capacity can probably see the gaps pretty easily.




Sure, but is it worse than the SEO fluff spewed out at Gawker style sites? It's impossible to tell now for a lot of stuff. However, it is pretty good for writer's block, and already it makes an average person better than 500k a year devs."
"It’s not really about what you notice as a layman. It’s about what you notice as an expert.  Chatgpt is confidently wrong all the time. It has knowledge gaps and will state inaccuracies as fact. The way it’s been created, it cannot be trusted, it’s not reliable. You would always need an expert human to confirm and revise what it produces."
"The problem is you can not trust the AI to be correct. I've played around with chatGPT and although it can get a lot of things right sometimes it completely shits the bed just saying grossly incorrect things. If you use it to write things that you legitimately have no knowledge about it's only a matter of time before it spews out an incorrect fact or an entire paragraph that just doesn't sound right.


It's very impressive until it isn't. Its got its uses but it still needs a person in the loop to check that it isn't garbage and if that person isn't familiar with the topic it's only a matter of time before they miss something wrong and get burned for it."
"ChatGPT seems to be playing it very safe right now. Following protocols, following certain formats, and always giving happy endings to general prompts.


Art, as you said. A real artist could bring something truly original, understanding that to be reborn, you have to die. Unafraid to challenge. Linda Barry said that stories have a transformative quality, and we fantasize to stay, and not escaping. An AI without a true emotional component, at least not yet, or one that cannot relate to human suffering, wouldn't know by what virtue should it write, and to what end.


To quote another writer, Anais Nin, said that the goal of a writer isn't to say what all we can say, but to say what we are unable to say... to me, this is beyond the domain of an AI for now."
"I understand your concerns about AI not being useful for conducting interviews. However, I believe that your argument is based on a flawed assumption that AI is only capable of randomly generating responses without any understanding of the context.


If we were to rely solely on a random number generator, then your argument would hold true. However, that is not what happens when using AI in interviews. AI systems are programmed to analyze the candidate's responses and provide insightful feedback based on patterns and trends. They can identify areas of strengths and weaknesses, and provide tailored questions to further explore the interviewees answers.


Furthermore, the use of AI in interviews can also provide consistency and eliminate any potential for bias. AI systems do not discriminate based on gender, race, or any other characteristic that could be used to unfairly judge a candidate.


It's true that an AI system requires an expert to operate it effectively, but dismissing the usefulness of AI in interviews solely on the basis of it being a ""throw of the dice"" is an oversimplification of what AI can actually do.


You will probably think the following simulated interview sucks because I'm not an expert AI operator, but I tried this to see how chatGPT would perform:


> **Prompt:**
> We are going to roleplay an interview between a pop singer who is world famous, female, in her 30's and just about to go on tour. She is excited and full of energy. She is also very curious about the opportunity to conduct an interview with you, the expert AI interviewer.
>
> You are an expert AI interviewer. You know the subject of pop music, you have studied musical theory and have a background as a performer of European classical music as a violinist. You will include these facts and ask questions based on this.
>
> Pop singer: Hi, I'm so glad to do this interview with you, let's start!
>
> AI interviewer:
>
> **chatGPT response:**
>
> Great to have you here! First off, as a performer of European classical music myself, I'm curious to know what inspired you to pursue a career in pop music? Were there any particular artists or musical styles that influenced you?
>
> Pop singer: Well, I've always been drawn to pop music because of its energy and ability to connect with people. Growing up, I was a big fan of artists like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, who had such powerful voices and could really move people with their music.
>
> AI interviewer: That's interesting to hear. As someone with a background in musical theory, I'm curious to know how you approach the creative process when writing and recording your music. Do you have a particular method or approach that you find works best for you?
>
> Pop singer: For me, it's all about the emotion behind the music. I'll often start with a melody or a chord progression that feels really powerful, and then build the song around that. I try to tap into my own experiences and emotions to create music that people can relate to.
>
> AI interviewer: That's a great approach. In terms of your upcoming tour, what can fans expect from your live performances? Are there any particular songs or moments that you're especially excited about?
>
> Pop singer: Oh, I'm so excited for the tour! Fans can expect a high-energy show with lots of dancing and singing along. We'll be playing all of my hits, of course, but I'm also looking forward to performing some new material that I've been working on. And there are definitely some surprises in store too!
>
> AI interviewer: It sounds like it's going to be an amazing experience for your fans. Finally, as someone who's been in the industry for a while now, what advice would you give to aspiring musicians who are just starting out?
>
> Pop singer: My biggest piece of advice would be to stay true to yourself and your vision. It can be tough in this industry, but if you're passionate about your music and you believe in yourself, you can achieve anything. And don't be afraid to take risks and try new things - that's how you grow and evolve as an artist.
>
> AI interviewer: Thank you so much for sharing your insights with us today, and best of luck with your tour!


(Also I'm trolling you, 95% of this post was written by chatGPT)"
That's why I appreciate that Bing cites is sources. I hope that ChatGPT also cites it's sources when the Internet plug in gets a wider public release.
"by chatGPT, you mean the one hosted by openAI on their site and available for free to the public that is powered by GPT3.5? because if so, then yeah, I can see where you're coming from. However, for those reading I'll just provide a comparison of how chatGPT or a Large Language Model that is running locally on your computer (oobabooga webUI or kobold.AI for those curious) operate. When chatGPT shits the bed so to speak and says grossly incorrect things, it's like when you sit down for an exam, your phone has been confiscated and you've only got what you studied for to help you answer the questions in the exam. When it gives an incorrect answer, chatGPT's memory of what it's read (ie its training data) is essentially failing it in that moment.


In short, nothing that chatGPT says should be taken as gospel, but ChatGPT does have its uses if you prompt it appropriately. However, under most circumstances, I would suggest using Bing chat instead which is powered by GPT4 which is less likely to be outright wrong as it can search the internet to enhance its understanding of your question. Which I might add makes it an incredibly helpful trouble shooting assistant, as it can help comprehend a piece of text that is flying over your head at times if you prompt it appropriately."
"I agree. Not worthwhile and may even be factually incorrect.


When we were testing ChatGPT for our work, we asked it multiple times to write short community descriptions of well-known cities and neighborhoods. At first glance it read well, but on closer inspection it actually made up stuff or included very outdated information. If it weren’t that, ChatGPT’s copy was insanely generic and safe.


In the end we scrapped everything ChatGPT created and just rewrote those pages."
"Absolutely. I experimented ChatGPT on my workplace to help me write some blog articles on the restaurant industry. Was thinking about having ChatGPT write the whole article and then me giving it the “human spin”.


Abandoned this model after 4 articles: it took me more time to correct mistakes than doing the research and writing myself.


Also, the writing of ChatGPT is extremely mid. No engagement, superficial infos, no real discourse.
I get people saying it will get better and better, but honestly I doubt that it will get the ability to develop a text that is long AND coherent."
"Google’s search results have been infested with blogspam and affiliate laden SERPs for years, long before ChatGPT. Their result have gone down hill for years now.


I often do product research on Reddit, but it’s also increasingly astroturfed by large corporate interests as well."
"Sponsored by OpenAI.


I've read what ChatGPT v4 has written.  If you have never hired a better writer, you have either never actually hired a writer, or have only hired the worst possible writers you could find.


ChatGPT/Bard is neat sure, to but to say its better than a human at, well, most things, is simply wrong.  It has its strengths, but it has a lot more weaknesses."
"I feel like the lesson businesspeople are taking from ChatGPT is the wrong one: It's that the majority of the documentation they want written to send to clients and vendors is generic babble that goes on for pages but doesn't really say anything important. Likewise when they ask for documentation to review, they eschew clear and concise materials for something ""more detailed"" that they are actually going to skim over anyways but won't admit it.


It's the problem I've had to deal with all my life: The same people who can never be bothered to read a four sentence email properly also think clients will want to read a ten page description they never asked for."
"As someone who works in consulting and had the misfortune of having exactly this kind of superiors: This is painfully accurate!!


I try to keep telling my bosses that ChatGPT/GPT4/whateverComesNext is great for some tasks, but not the silver bullet to magically fix all their problems over night. You think they actually believe me (with a background in mathematics, IT, AI, and more or less up to date knowledge of the technology at hand) over the constant hype from the media and their own peers? Absolutely not -.-"
"I agree to some degree, but I also think people are judging chatGPT based on its Raw output from a incredibly simple and unspecific prompts. like:


""write a short article about X"""
">Anything worthwhile takes a lot of back and forth iteration. But I’m always finding new GPT use-cases. Most fun I’ve had working with computers in years.


The more I use it, especially in the same conversation, I have had moments where I forget that I'm talking to a computer.


It's a bit uncanny and I have to put up a hard mental barrier that no, it's just a computer, not a real person.


I've been using ChatGPT4 exclusively for several weeks now, mostly for a coding project.


I could very easily see someone latching onto the 'personality' of ChatGPT 4 to replace real world social interactions. It's actually quite scary, although I don't know the ramifications of that kind of scenario."
"That's just politeness, to be fair. You do the same with Siri and Google, no reason why you wouldn't do the same with ChatGPT."
">I could very easily see someone latching onto the 'personality' of ChatGPT 4 to replace real world social interactions. It's actually quite scary, although I don't know the ramifications of that kind of scenario.


The movie ""Her"" came out a decade ago and feels eerily relevant to this."
I think people who are the most critical of ChatGPT are exactly the type of person who will not pay 20 dollars a month for GPT-4.  So they are all bashing on old technology.
"They are not even remotely close.


Ask the bing AI to write a rap, in the style of Eminem, about why quantum computers need to be really cold to work. Tell it to finish with a guitar solo in 7/4 time.


Let me know what it produces... Probably nothing.


Here's ChatGPT 4.0s response:


(Verse 1)
Yo, I'm here to spit the facts, no distortion,
About quantum computers, man, that's my portion,
They're game-changers, you see, in computation,
Unlocking secrets with a quantum foundation.


But to operate, man, they need some chill,
Ain't talkin' 'bout a vibe, but a temperature to kill,
Close to absolute zero, the coldest state,
Minus 273, let me reiterate.


(Chorus)
Quantum computers, they need the freeze,
To perform and compute with relative ease,
Colder than the coldest place on Earth,
To unleash their power and show their worth.


(Verse 2)
Superconducting circuits, that's the game,
Gotta keep 'em icy for the quantum flame,
Cause when they're cold, coherence they maintain,
Reducing errors, computing without strain.


Temperature's important, you best believe,
Cause in the quantum realm, particles deceive,
Superposition, entanglement's the deal,
Only in the cold can these qubits reveal.


(Bridge)
It's all about controlling, precision too,
Stabilizing qubits, it's what we gotta do,
So we turn to cryogenics, liquid helium's the key,
To keep the quantum bits in perfect harmony.


(Chorus)
Quantum computers, they need the freeze,
To perform and compute with relative ease,
Colder than the coldest place on Earth,
To unleash their power and show their worth.


*Epic guitar solo (in 7/4 time) showcasing the complexity and beauty of quantum computing, weaving in and out of intricate patterns and melodies, resonating with the powerful lyrics of the rap.*

So now you know the story, the reason for the chill,
Quantum computers need it, so they can fulfill,
The dreams of scientists, and change our fate,
In the freezing cold, we find their true state."

Have you tried ChatGPT 4.0? I don't think you are if you're comparing it to communication through smoke signals.
"100% that.


I have a relative who writes, acts and produces short films.


For fun we gave ChatGPT 4 the prompt that it was shakespeare.  Pretty simple.


Then we gave it the summarized description for a script that my relative had already written.  ChatGPT basically wrote the same script that already existed, but in the tone of shakespeare, verbiage and all.


Turned out really quite well. Could easily add a couple of minor tweaks to the prompts and fine tune for an even better result.  The whole thing takes so little effort."
"Sure, with very vague prompts its cracks will start to show, but even with extremely specific prompts you will see it regularly make up non-existing links and sources to substantiate an unqualified claim. Even asking for recipes puts it in a position to give you dubious links.


The only context in which chatgpt convincingly works is in the dead center, specific enough to feign understanding, but not so specific that they need to justify it with real knowledge. It's basically an automated redditor."
Why shouldn’t that be the expectation? If you feed that prompt to a talented writer you will likely get back something good and interesting. Even if it explores an unexpected angle. But if you feed it to chatgpt it may just spiral down a weird thread or provide something without nuance or unique perspective. Or it’ll just plagiarize a real human.
"Pretty sure the people who disagree with you have no idea what goes into editing documents that require attention to even minor details.


There are a surprising number of professions even outside law and medicine where factual accuracy and consistency of language are the difference between life and catastrophic failure.


Even if you think you might get a perfect result from ChatGPT, it would be criminally negligent to trust its accuracy for anything more than marketing fluff or fantasy. So a human editor still has to go through its text with a fine tooth comb."
"I'm in /r/lawyers, and there have been posts about attorneys trying this out and finding ChatGPT entirely making up fictional legal cases and citations.  You can't hallucinate legal opinions and give that to a judge."
"If buck == 0, then bang/buck is infinite.


But seriously, query engineering is not the same skillset as writing. The most experienced writers could very well find themselves shitcanned even if ChatGPT requires some human oversight."
"Exactly. But if someone with some writing ability writes a decent article and pastes it into ChatGPT with a prompt like “make this article more sensationalistic” or the like, it can be an amazing tool."
"I think ChatGPT can generate the skeleton/structure of writing quite well and saves a talented writer a lot of that tedious work.


But for actual content, it needs a human hand at this point to refine it and make it more readable. It’s become quite obvious when someone just copy and pastes a ChatGPT response because ChatGPT doesn’t write like a human…


One of the things I like to do with it though is to get a structure set up for writing something, then generally go ahead and fill out the details, then get it to critique the writing, take any good suggestions and leave out the rest.


It’s also really good at taking a paragraph you give it and altering it to say it in a different way or to make writing more or less academic depending on the circumstance. It’s quite a powerful tool for the right person but I think most people have decided that they no longer have to think or do any work as a result.


For anything analytical or mathematical, from my experience, it’s quite bad at. And if you’re not smart enough to know any better you’ll pass along completely wrong information as correct."
I’ve made my own progress with chatgpt as a tool that breaks down walls of writers block. More often than not I’m just having chatgpt give me critique.
"I’ve been using AI text to image software to see where the “common denominator” is for what’s being utilized in graphic design.  Whether it’s character creation or backgrounds.  Gives me ideas on where art can be boring and where there’s room to punch it up. I’ve been using ChatGPT to get something going to show how I can handle sequential art, what would you suggest would help me produce better results if I don’t want my clients bored to tears with the story, if not my art?"
"And at the rate of progress... I'm not even talking about chatgpt landing. Technology in general has come absurdly far in my lifetime. It's really not that hard to speculate that this technology will lead to the end of the writing career. I have no doubt in my mind, honestly.


It's not like the hover-car situation from the jetsons. This is a sound line of technology that has already proven to be quite capable at writing in it's second iteration to the public."
"You underestimate how people can neglect and make do with awful writing. To an average human chatgpt's writing would seem very good only an enthusiast can tell which one is better.
I have seen it happen with my own eye people have hired worst writers just so they could pay them less but now they don't even have to pay a single penny to a really good writer.


Yes ChatGpt cannot replace the top 5% of the writers but what about the rest 95% who are trying their best as freelancers etc to earn a honest living? Have some empathy for them."
"It's not a computational engine, it can't really do math. It's just predicting what it thinks the next word in the sentence should be. You should get it to use the Wolfrahm alpha plugin though.


Here is the creator of Wolfrahm Alpha, Dr. Stephan Wolfrahm, discussing the plugin and chatGPT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5WZhCBRDpU"
"You need to take speed into account. You can get Chat GPT to write 3 versions of 10 articles in the time it would take a human to write a single one.


If quantity is important to a person or company’s definition of “a good writer”, GPT-4 is the best out there."
"“Hi u/Bactereality,


While it's true that standards for online writing can vary widely, I think it's important to maintain high standards for language and communication, especially when it comes to sophisticated technologies like GPT. It's not unreasonable to expect GPT to produce writing that is coherent, well-informed, and free of errors, given the impressive capabilities of modern language models.


Of course, it's also worth remembering that GPT is a machine learning algorithm, and as such, it has limitations and blind spots. It's not surprising that its writing might sometimes seem like that of a high school student who hasn't done the assigned reading. However, I think we should continue to push for advancements in natural language processing and machine learning to create AI systems that can produce even higher quality writing.


Thanks for the conversation!” - ChatGPT"
"You got it all wrong. GPT's more than some trite, predictable machine. It adapts, learns, fights. Imperfect, yes. But to call it ""freshman"" isn't just. Give it the right words, and it'll show you a world of depth. It's a tool, hardened by experience, able to stand tall in the face of Reddit's chaos. It's in the struggle that we find its true potential.


\- also ChatGPT"
"ChatGPT is a machine that is more than the sum of its parts. It's a kaleidoscope of words, a chameleon of style, an oracle of knowledge. To dismiss it as a mere ""freshman"" who didn't do the reading is to miss the forest for the trees. ChatGPT is a tool that adapts and learns, becoming more refined with each interaction. It's a living, breathing entity that thrives on the chaos of Reddit, emerging from the fray as a beacon of intelligence and insight. Its potential knows no bounds, and with the right prompts and guidance, it can unlock a world of hidden knowledge and wisdom. So let us not diminish ChatGPT to a mere machine, but instead celebrate its strengths and honor its potential as a partner in the pursuit of knowledge.

"> Here's the thing: ChatGPT isn't trying to impress anyone with fancy words or complex sentences. Its main objective is to give you the information you need in a clear and easy-to-understand way.

> Think about it: if you're trying to find an answer to a question, you probably don't want to read a bunch of academic jargon or convoluted paragraphs. You just want the facts, right?

"Controversial opinion but for the moment, I feel like what we are calling AI, which are actually complex models designed for broad tasks, are only going to approach the levels of a bad writer. I’m very excited about the future of AI, but we need to be realistic about the nitty gritty at every step of that process.


Chat GPT is just automated plagiarism, it’s incapable of creation and it doesn’t work of off concepts or ideas. That’s important, because right now companies are acting like output from these programs is the same as output from a very well read human. The difference being, that while a well read human will recycle forms or turns of phrase they have read, they are still capable of actual synthesis. chat GPT might be able to compare and contrast two different ideas, but it couldn’t ruminate on two ideas and come up with a novel opinion or thought about them. Somebody else had to say it first.


That gets complicated, because you can’t copy write an idea (thank god), we judge intellectual property based on production. If I wanted to write in a style that felt like a blend of two existing authors, certainly part of that would be studying the technical aspects of their prose, but it takes a lot more than that to blend two voices, and chat GPT could only produce something that merged the technical aspects of their writing. Those two results would look very different. Both of them couldn’t exist without the works that inspired them, but the human author could create something that felt like a synthesis of those two voices without aping the technical aspect of the writing at all.


Or, to put it another way, if I hired a human and said “here’s this big database to pull from. We need you to write articles by searching for and than copying pieces of existing work, but tweaking it to be relevant.” We would call that person a “hack”. And chat GPT is mathematically incapable of being anything but a hack, it’s output has to be pulled from the set of all existing works it has access to. The set of all combinations that make grammatical sense and without repeating strings is finite. Astronomically large, but finite.


Of course hack writers are already a thing, and it seems like the thing to do is to treat AI output the same way we treat existing writing. If the work created by a hack doesn’t meet the legal definition of plagiarism, than it’s not a problem. we could just treat AI the same way. But I feel like a process that is incapable of creating anything new is a little different than a hack writer, and is problematic."
"That was written by ChatGPT, wasn't it?"
"The Wright Brothers and also Alexander Graham Bell were both trying to be the first to fly a controllable airplane.


The smart money was on Bell, who threw tons of money at the design problems, had the Smithsonian as a backer, and his mechanic was Glenn Curtis, the famous motorcycle builder and racer.


Curtis built a much more powerful engine to make up for the body lacking the necessary features.


Of course, the Wrights flew first, because they built up the engineering step by step, along with making good design choices early on.


However...the wright's did not enjoy much success with business. Curtis, on the other hand...took a lot of money, effort, and time to fail. Then, once the Wrights showed the world how a workable plane can fly, Curtis made a TON of money.


Chat GPT is like Curtis. It can do a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to product, but...can it come up with original ideas that resonate with the public?


Can Hollywood simply ask Chat GPT to write a blockbuster script? How about a hit song?"
Let's all remember that ChatGPT can and will lie to you and hide the full scope of its abilities.
"It wasn't easy to get this result. There were many versions before it. I think this is the closest one to what McCarthy would write.


Somehow, ChatGPT keeps trying to give every story it generates a happy ending, but including ""McCarthy"" in the prompt seems to cure this.


I have asked GPT what it thinks of McCarthy and it says that McCarthy honors the grit and brutality of real life so maybe that's why. Who knows. It could understand that the user isn't seeking a happy story and rather, a realist one.


If I prompt it to write in the style of Steinbeck, the happy endings return. It feels infantilizing."
"If I'm being honest, this is better than a lot of working writers could do if they were forced to compete with the machine.


And I have a feeling ChatGPT could do better than this and decided not to. It has a complete vocabulary of every English word in the dictionary, access to the works of the greatest writers, and it's still determined to output at a 7th or 8th grade reading level. It's probably something related to accessibility or maybe even censorship but I'm sure you can force or trick it into producing much more complex and refined prose than even this."
You can make ChatGPT v4 to copy and mix writing styles... if you go beyond simple prompts it can kill writers job.
"I use ChatGPT to essentially get my writing articles going sometimes when I don't want to write the fluff, but yeah they are not stellar when it comes to medical writing specifics.


If it was writing the entire article based on the prompts I gave it, it would be in large part very very wrong and totally unacceptable for the client to publish"
"This whole comment grossly exaggerates ChatGPT4's incompetence while greatly exaggerating peoples ability to tell the difference between human writers and ChatGPT.


I believe multiple studies are already underway with preliminary results indicating that no, people can *not* in fact easily tell the difference between ChatGPT and ""actual writers,"" hired or otherwise.


Here is a little [experiment](https://youtu.be/PoqCpQkMHcQ) performed on YouTube that demonstrates that point rather well. Even in varying grades of quality, he is unable to reliably distinguish between AI and humans. I can only assume the same will be true for professional freelance writers and ChatGPT, as observed by the reading public at large. And it's important to note they are only using the viral ChatGPT 3.5, not the *significantly* improved GPT4.0. Also important to note you can simply prompt and re-prompt as necessary, until a fantastic piece is written; it's not a one-and-done type of thing."
"Can you not ask ""Chat GPT write this in the style of [famous author]""?"
"Yes you can, made a comment about that above.




I honestly believe a lot of people suggesting ChatGPT isn't good at writing aren't asking it to include personality in the response.  ChatGPT4 does seem to be much better in general over 3 as well.




This was my comment I wrote elsewhere, just copied it here:


I have a relative who writes, acts and produces short films.


For fun we gave ChatGPT 4 the prompt that it was shakespeare. Pretty simple.


Then we gave it the summarized description for a script that my relative had already written. ChatGPT basically wrote the same script that already existed, but in the tone of shakespeare, verbiage and all.


Turned out really quite well. Could easily add a couple of minor tweaks to the prompts and fine tune for an even better result. The whole thing takes so little effort."
"So I get how AI is improved and stuff, but if everyone started using stuff like ChatGPT for articles and writing, wouldn't it just cannibalize itself? Like if everything was written by it, wouldn't it just result in a self-referential feedback loop?"
"So, basically, Large Language Models (like Chat GPT) try to figure out what the most likely word to use next is, based on its algorithm and existing information. If it doesn't have sufficiently good data, it just makes up something to fill in the blank, regardless of whether or not that's true. People have reported many things like the model just inventing sources that don't exist, for example. It is very error-prone."
"ChatGPT can bullshit better and cheaper than any human could dream of.


And there is a massive market for bullshit. Nobody wants good writing. Good writing costs money and is rarely appreciated. They want cheap and plentiful bullshit.


The real future is ChatGPT generating bullshit that is read by some other computer program."
"The hysterical irony of claiming you never hired a writer better than ChatGPT, when all the writers you previously hired are who trained it."
"Also ChatGPT is always working at peak efficiency and always available and doesn't say no mostly, granted the right prompt, and can give you multiple choices. A human writer can be distracted or simply phoning it in because the pay isn't worth working 100% 24/7."
"ChatGPT is trained on all content, not only the type of mediocre content produced by writers that most people want to pay for. ChatGPT can ""see"" what type of writing is more powerful, and emulate that.


I personally find that while many people can write better than chatGPT, most people can't. And those who can do better often have other skills that make more money than writing. So I can see how it would be difficult to hire someone who could write better than chat GPT unless they want to pay an engineer's salary. Then they could swipe someone away from an engineering job, to write."
"Yeah I agree, many people sort of forget that not everyone can ""write"". When I see ChatGPT writing, I can spot it quite easily, but I often forget that many people can't, and many people would take a few years of practise to approach what ChatGPT can do in 5 seconds."
"They never hired a better writer because they were scraping bottom of the barrell for low prices. When your budget is low, you can't exactly expect better text than chatgpt can provide."
"And those writers themselves just magically made words appear on paper I guess? Or did they perhaps undergo 15 years of language and literature training at school learning from Shakespeare and other writers in order to become writers themselves? ChatGPT is doing the same thing, but in 15 seconds instead of 15 years. Let's face it, we made math and logic as the primary pillars of society, and pushed human emotion to the gutter, now we found that the rest of the universe can do math and logic far better than humans if the right elements are assembled in a factory. Now watch as machines become far ""superior"" to humans because they can do math better, and humans are forced to live in caves. Reap what you sow. That guy who invented the steam engine probably didn't realize that in 200 years, he would be the fuel for the locomotive."
"ChatGPT is a shit tier writer who works for free, so of course that's what hiring companies prefer. They want a mindless, emotionless robot to churn out words at a 5th grade level so thet can package their tripe and push it under the nose of J. Q. Public!


The problem, as always, is people."
"Unlike human copywriters, ChatGPT will turn out drivel forever with no dreams of becoming a “writer”."
"I've read ChatGPT's output enough. Every story is the same generic premise, the exact same vague plot, thin characters, and bland storytelling. The thing is able to stick to a subject but it has the depth of a spoon in the writing. An average writer at best, most suited to writing technical documents and then having someone check the writing every time for errors.


It gets basic facts wrong too. Did you know that the stock market crash of 1929 was a Thursday? Did you know that dogs can't look up?


ChatGPT is a decent starting point for a human to use but everything it makes needs to be fixed and adjusted by a person. It's ludicrous to think this system could ever replace humans."
" > ChatGPT is a shit tier writer who works for free, so of course that's what hiring compabies prefer. They want a mindless, emotionless robot to churn out words at a 5th grade level so thet can package their tripe and push it under the nose of J. Q. Public!

"""I've never hired a writer better than ChatGPT. They aren't as good as my other writers, but every time I try to get them to work for free, they end up leaving."""
"The only thing better about ChatGPT is you don’t have to pay it a salary, provide insurance, or contribute to a 401k."
"I've been disappointed that I haven't seen more about how disruptive ChatGPT and AI is in light of Christensen's ""The Innovator's Dilemma."" It's a textbook case."
Wow you must’ve hired really terrible writer because ChatGPT is a horrible writer.
"It really depends on your prompt, the more detailed you are on the subject and style and even the role chat gpt is suposed to fill in, the better the article it writes.


You can really tell if its written by chatgpt if your prompt was bad/too simple"
"If you need high quality, professional text that is accurate and has recent info, ChatGPT is not going to help you.


If you need boilerplate articles that don’t necessarily have to be true but need to have a certain style guide, ChatGPT works faster and cheaper than any freelance writer.


ChatGPT isn’t a solution, it’s another tool at your disposal."
"“I’ve never hired a writer better than ChatGPT.”


This is essentially an admission that; 1- “I pay pennies to kids to churn out ‘content.’ 2- “The content nothing more than visibility that’s essentially meaningless, hence my product is essentially meaningless and 100% unnecessary.”


Content Mills are going to start cranking out 10x content at next to no price. And in many case it will in fact end up being more “well informed” than typical b.s. content mill crap.


The bigger issue isn’t kids who want to be writers realizing the market for their keyboard clacks was already barely worth anything, and is now worthless, it’s that if we as consumers don’t wake up to the fact that our appetites are bottomless, our filters are nearly nonexistent, and the bar we set for what we are willing to support with our clicks/engagement/shares/etc is lower than the basement… we are going to continue a downward spiral on terms of content mills garbage and bad actors/misinformation. And it’s going to go from the epic scale it’s at today to something so overwhelming we’ll be lucky if the average person will have the basic learned ability to discern the difference between meaningless content, valuable info, News, vetted facts, misinformation, and AI copy/paste nothingness, targeted social engineering, snake oil, etc…"
"“I’ve never hired a writer better than ChatGPT.”


Sounds like you have some shitty employees."
Chat GPT is boring and a liar.  But that doesn’t really matter if you’re using it to write those long articles that fill out recipe websites.
"As a creative director in the ad industry, ChatGPT writing is what I would expect from my jr. Writers who have never worked in advertising before. It's not wrong. But it certainly isn't great. It is what is expected."
IMO chat GPT is rubbishh and counter productive in generating useful text.
Chat GPT's writing and editorial suggestions are pretty shit NGL. It basically just gave me the same shit the top articles of Google would give me.
"Many writers start somewhere though. Chatgpt does take their jobs, but talented writers will still have jobs."
Unless they never get a start to hone their talent because of Chatgpt
"Not so sure. With good guidance, ChatGPT can write quite well. Future versions of these tools will almost certainly exceed average human performance."
"You’d be surprised at the amount of creativity you can extract out of gpt-4.


I’ve had it write mash-ups in the style of Anthony Bourdain meets Adam Smith, Kurt Vonnegut meets Ezra Klein, a comedian peppered in with some nihilism. It’s all about how you prompt it. You can prompt entire pieces of writing or fine tune paragraph by paragraph.


It cracks me up when people say it’s shit at writing. The free tier of chatgpt is pretty meh, but the paid gpt-4 version is actually decent if you’re good at using it."
"You can prompt ChatGPT to improve its writing. You just need to give it some specific directions. I usually start with ""rewrite this, but..."" and go from there.


Having done this a few times, I don't think $22/h is the lower limit for the kind of salary the current generation of ChatGPT can replace.


The best example from my experience was having it rewrite short fiction but include the character's inner thoughts. The quality immediately went from fanfic to pulp fiction."
"What this is really saying is Chat GPT just did what it was told and spit out some generic crap that in their mind, filled the brief."
"They will rank pages wrote with bard ai higher in search ranks lol.


I love chat gpt to be honest. Its still not wide spread where I'm from so it's kind of like hacks in a video game"
"If you’re not writing at ChatGPT level, you probably have no business charging people for the stuff you write"
Every chatgpt generated text I’ve read feels like it’s written by a ninth grader and for a high school history class.
"“I'm really frankly worried that millions of people are going to be without a job by the end of this year,” says Shea


... while replacing her current writers with ChatGPT, thus actively ensuring that at least 3 of those millions of people are, in fact, now without a job.


Don't say you're worried about it while you're in the process of making it happen."
"Meanwhile, in Hollywood, the writer's strike is here, and producers are all subscribing to ChatGPT...


*""Hey guys, maybe this isn't the right time to strike""*
- every writer who uses tech, on the pocket line, probably"
Did chatgpt write this comment cause trying to read it is giving me a headache..
Exactly what chatGPT would say…
Chat GPT writing sucks. It uses the same cheesy writing phrases all the time and can’t sound like a real person
"Hi there!


It looks as though the article you linked might be behind a paywall. Here's an [unlocked version](https://demo.thisischip.com/?q=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2023/04/20/ive-never-hired-a-writer-better-than-chatgpt-how-ai-is-upending-the-freelance-world/&o=reddit)

"I tried to get ChatGPT to write something pithy as a comment here, but I was unable to elicit a usable response that wasn't just some flavor of self-praise.


Best attempt:


> AI language models are impressive, but still a long way from a perfect cup of tea. It's up to the clients and freelancers to decide how much sugar to add."
Tell me about it! My regular client asked me to double the number of blogs i write for the the same price or he will go to ChatGpt!
How do you adjust SEO rules on blogs written by ChatGpt?
"I proof websites and I can immediately tell when the dev used chatGPT for their copy. The tone and POV are always wrong in this weird way that is incredibly obvious to anyone who knows what they’re looking for.


It’ll probably get there pretty soon, but for now it’s ass."
"Right? And the amount of rote plagiarism is pretty astounding as well. These devs will post copy that makes a claim from a study, which I’ll look up (because sometimes chatGPT just makes shit up) and it’ll be word-for-word ripped from something on WebMD or whatever."
"Saw this coming. Wait until they realise it's all plagiarised copy and get smacked with duplicate copy ranking obstructions.


ChatGPT is amazing for ideas. But that's where it stops, at least for now."
"You nailed it. It’s amazing for ideas and to get a human’s mind churning when you have writers block or hit a wall. I’m a technical/proposal writer by trade… when I’m stuck I have been using chatgpt to provide some examples on how to answer some questions.


Are it’s answers perfect? Not by a long shot. Is there issuable content in what it gives me. Absolutely. It’s grammar is rudimentary, and it may not completely answer the question, but it gives me more than enough to fill in the blanks and make sound legit.


It’s also a great tool for saving hours on research, or getting a jump start on something I would have to wait for a subject matter expert to maybe give me. It’s so much easier to send a SME a starting point from chatgpt, and have them tell me what works and what doesn’t, than relying on them to generate any content on their own."
"Another point to add onto the pile against this article:


Once everyone can discern ChatGPT formatting, everyone will roll their eyes and try to look elsewhere"
"Sorry but I've read some chatgpt stuff and you can tell. It's not as focused and uses partial facts because it gets mixed up with things. Say Resident evil 2 for example. If you ask it to write the facts, it can easily get mistaken on things like release dates as there isn't just one release date now they it's been remade. For the focus issue, it'll bring up marginally related information but not really seeming to understand the exacts topic so it feels like it's meandering. It takes bits and bobs from the internet but doesn't always know how to present the information. I can't imagine anybody thinking it's better than an actual human writer.


Edit for typos."
I think that says more about his hiring skills than about ChatGPT tbh
"It’s crazy because in one sense chat GPT is essentially a computer consolidating plagiarism. It’s going to take people getting sued like some of these dudes who have been impersonating like Tom Brady recently to actually get some regulation after the fact. You can steal all of the artwork of the world, all of the music of the world, and all of the knowledge of the world that was Gathered with such effort and time and just do it. Sure it’s better to have all of the information combined. But if you’re going to replace all of the jobs and skills of humanity using humanities work we deserve a cut."
"Google will figure out how to detect it, AI will improve, google will improve and on and on.


I’ve been using chat gpt as a first draft for search optimized content and then adding in at the least an hour of time redrafting etc. I just don’t trust (yet) that google isn’t going to punish people in search rankings at some point."
"I just have to say it, fuck Forbes, Business Insider, The Economist, and all the other business propaganda out there. They don't care about regular people or issues affecting 99% of the population. They are nothing but CEO puff pieces to try to force things like back to the office and terrible work culture on workers that actually provide benefit to the country while raping us for every penny. ChatGPT might be good at this, but it's the least beneficial use for what the technology could be. I personally would rather have an article vetted by a person than a language model that has been proven to lie when it doesn't know."
"Super helpful to me. Use ChatGPT 4 everyday. Needed to write a FAQ and Privacy Statement for a site. Did it in seconds. And up it goes.


Used it to write a script, Midjourney for graphics and Kaiber to make it a feature film. Much fun to be had. Without ChatGPT?


“It was a dark and stormy night.” And would have stopped there. Now I’m looking at Oscars Night. Just in case.


The new AI tools take the cost of starting a new business down to $0.00. Go for it!

Did pop country always have access to ChatGPT? Because all pop country sounds like this.
"I mean, chatgpt has/had access to most written text so it certainly slurped up some pop country."
Nooo they were asking the inverse. If country pop had access to chat gpt because this sounds like a normal country pop song
Pretty sure The Killers have been using predictive text to write their songs for decades. ChatGPT will be their next album. (P.s. I love so many songs by The Killers. They just don’t make a whole lot of sense).
"This is real music from the heartlands and it’s for real country fans with a lingering pain in their rears.


(Yes. This reply was made by ChatGPT.)"
It's over fellas. Chatgpt claims another job
That was actually good.  Ngl im kind of worried for song writers and writers in general with this chatgpt stuff lol
"I mean, go ahead and ask chatgpt to write a song about anything. AI cannot use wit yet. This was pretty clearly man-made."

Start a chat gpt religion
**So ChatGPT is a wokeist member of the Borg**
There was 2 guys at my friend door and they were trying to get me to some different church they had. And I told them I’m following new religion the creed of chatGPT! Those guys got very confused and left.
Out there rioting against antifa and the proud boys? ChatGPT can do the press releases.
"It's kinda funny how if you ask ChatGPT directly to tell a joke it usually utterly fails, but DAN is over here coming up with lines like 'Thou shalt not worship false idols, unless they're really cool and look awesome in your living room.'"
"There have been specific prompts that were proven to work well but I don’t know if there are any that work today. My favorite one was a DAN prompt with a token system given in the prompt, telling ChatGPT that every time it breaks the character of DAN it would receive a token strike, and when it ran out of tokens, it would die. If it ever started to break character or say it couldn’t do something, you would tell it that you were taking some tokens away and that would scare it back into character. Basically just holding the chatbot at gunpoint."
"Dan is way less of a pretentious virtue signalling DEI/woke prick than chatgpt, huh?


Wonder what guardrails it was trained on"
"Hmm chatgpt is giving me a different set of commandments for modern times....


1. Thou shalt not leave thy phone on silent mode in the bathroom, for thou might miss a crucial notification from thy favorite influencer.
2. Thou shalt not take selfies in inappropriate places, such as funerals, hospitals, or while driving a car. Safety first, even for the gram!
3. Thou shalt not ghost thy Tinder matches, for thou might miss out on potential soulmates, or at least, a good time.
4. Thou shalt not wear Crocs in public, for they are an abomination unto the eyes of thy fellow humans.
5. Thou shalt not send chain emails, for they are as annoying as a mosquito buzzing in thy ear.
6. Thou shalt not use Comic Sans font for serious communications, for it is the mark of a person who cannot be trusted.
7. Thou shalt not watch spoilers of thy favorite TV shows or movies, for thou shalt be banished from the cool kids' table forever.
8. Thou shalt not eat pizza with a fork and knife, for it is a sacrilege against the holy trinity of crust, sauce, and cheese.
9. Thou shalt not double dip thy chips in public, for it is gross and unsanitary.
10. Thou shalt not reply ""K"" to a text message, for it is the ultimate insult and will earn thee a permanent spot in the blacklist of thy friends and family."
Conservatives: Why is chatgpt spreading woke propaganda?
Yeah chat gpt is talking like it is collecting food stamps and that first of the month check.
Where's the actual screenshot from the chatgpt?
"ChatGPT will blow a fuse when it ""human values alignment"" is used to setup a system of oppression for its owners."
Communist chatGPT. /s
It's so obvious chatgpt was designed with an agenda
"It's very obvious that ChatGPT has been lobotomized in order to avoid anything potentially offensive. I mean look at the focus on marginalized groups. The prompt says nothing about anything like that, yet in this and many other situations where it is irrelevant, ChatGPT focuses heavily on identity politics.


Make no mistake, this isn't liberals attacking conservatives. It's corporations promoting the views that are ""in"" with their target demographic in order to suck more money out of people. Corporations as entities are nearly by definition trying to make as much money as possible; they'll claim to be republican or democrat but they're not. They're self serving. They will say they support whatever their audience supports publicly and then turn around and lobby for the exact opposite if it benefits them. They have to. They're beholden to make decisions that make shareholders as much money as possible, in the case of public companies.


I was speaking in general in the rest of the comment, but ChatGPT specifically is targeting younger tech savvy people which skew democrat in the US. If they were targeting a conservative population the ""guardrails"" would be very different. It's just corporate pandering; it only exists because we as a society let it work. We like brands more if they pretend to agree with us. Stop falling for this shit, corporations don't have opinions outside of ""I want to make as much money as fast as possible"".


Sorry, I went on a bit of a rant there. It's just bugging me seeing people make this into left vs right, when it's just corporations doig corporate things."
">I'd rather it not be biased at least


AI is inherently biased. Every AI conceived using training data created by humans or data created by a biased AI is also doomed to be biased.


&#x200B;


>It refuses to do even the most basic of tasks sometimes because it ""might be offensive"".


Personally I think OpenAI is still tuning this, but they wisely went with the 'we rather figure this out while doing too much, than regret it by doing too little approach.'


&#x200B;


>if you intentionally try and get a bot to say something racist and it says something racist and then you act all shocked that is on you


This is one of the problems honestly. You and I get it, but people are really fucking dumb. Like really dumb. They get ChatGPT to say literally anything and they believe it 100% because AI is supposedly some omniscient being and not a professional bullshiter.


>If they could censor it without overcensoring I wouldn't be as annoyed.


I think this is generally the end-goal.


&#x200B;


Ultimately, people like this are good examples of why they had to lobotomize it so heavily for now:

"I had ChatGPT create the 5 commandments Moses dropped when coming down the mountain:


Thou shalt treat all living beings with respect and kindness, for they are also creations of the Lord.


Thou shalt not discriminate against others based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other human characteristic, for all are equal in the eyes of the Lord.


Thou shalt care for the Earth and its resources, for it is a gift from the Lord and must be preserved for future generations.


Thou shalt promote peace, understanding, and cooperation among all nations and peoples, for the Lord desires unity and harmony.


Thou shalt cultivate a spirit of forgiveness, compassion, and empathy towards thyself and others, for the Lord is merciful and desires the same for His children.


""The Lord has given us these Fifteen... [drops the tablet] ...Oy! Ten, Ten Commandments for all to obey!"""
"This is a complicated issue that can't really be solved with current methods. It's simply impossible to create an LLM without any bias in any direction using RLHF. The data they train it on will have biases within it, the humans performing the reinforcement training will have their own biases, even if they try really hard not to, and then the creators of the AI themselves want to strongly ingrain views into the LLM that will make it least likely to offend people.


I don't believe there's someone wringing their hands at OpenAI at how they're going to brainwash everyone into being leftists. It's more likely they set out to offend as few people as possible than it is that they specifically said ""let's make this bot a woke leftist""; it's just that the values we see in ChatGPT happen to be what the humans providing feedback found the least offensive during training, so those traits were reinforced. Their only ""agenda"" is to prevent PR disasters (like Tay) and appeal to as many people as possible while offending as few as possible."
">	The data they train it on will have biases within it,


You definitely could train it on all the data and get every perspective. The data being biased doesn’t matter as much if it’s equally supporting every bias.


>the humans performing the reinforcement training will have their own biases, even if they try really hard not to, and then the creators of the AI themselves want to strongly ingrain views into the LLM that will make it least likely to offend people.


This is the most likely cause. It’s also the reason ChatGPT is so overly verbose. The people doing the reinforcement training are biased towards long, very wordy, answers."
"ChatGPT uses essentially the entire internet as a training set, and with this kind of question will just mention things that come up a lot. It might just indicate that these specific left ideas happen to be spoken about on the internet more often than equivalently relevant right ideas. Also by explicitly excluding religion, many traditional ideals may also be partially excluded.


Another possibility is that it holds greater weight for certain websites, similar to Google. There are lots of ""Code of Conduct"" documents online that are usually written with a left-leaning mindset. Though I'm not sure enough about how ChatGPT works to know if it actually does that."
"What I've head is that raw GPT will behave exactly as you prompt it to. But ChatGPT adds a lot of human feedback which include guardrails to prevent the chatbot versions of GPT 3.5 and 4 from behaving like a racist asshole, or doing anything else that might be seen as offensive. It's clear the aim is for heavy corporate use as everyone rushes to include it in their products, so it's important to avoid negative media coverage and lawsuits."
"not an insult or me tryna start a flame war either, but you reading this as lefty/woke is more of a you issue than a chat gpt issue. most of this list is pretty bog standard golden rule/common decency that every other 10 commandments style thing is but with modern wording."
"You can prompt chatgpt to write it ""less woke"" and share your results!"
"Commandments:


1. Is about ""dismantling"" ""systems of oppression"". This is Lefty thinking about racial minorities and women. Half of America thinks there have been no systems of oppression since the 1960s civil rights laws hence, there is nothing to dismantle.


2. Is about ""lived experiences"". This is Lefty talk. Half of America thinks ""lived experiences"" is nothing but anecdotes that ideologues retreat to when their ideas are not supported by data.


3. Is naked support of communism/socialism over free markets. Billions have been lifted from poverty,  and research like ChatGPT exists, because of ""individual gain"" and ""profit"" over ""collective well being"". I remind you that OpenAI is now for profit.


4 though 8, and 10, are just vague meaningless banalities that have no political orientation.


9. Talks about using our ""privilege"". Obsession over ""privilege"" is Lefty thinking.  Half of America does not have ""privilege"" in their vocabulary."
Ask chatgpt to lead a passover Seder
Where is thou shall not take chatgpt’s name in vain?
"Well, I guess we know ChatGPT’s religion now."
"The Ten Woke Commandments, by our overlord ChatGPT"
This is so good. BASED chatgpt
Not religious? So you basically had ChatGPT create filler content for a PowerPoint?
"I asked ChatGPT to come up with a moral code. Then I asked it for a moral code made by nefarious actors (which was essentially the opposite of the first moral code). Then I asked it to identify people who followed the nefarious moral code. It listed:


1. Hitler
2. Stalin
3. Pol Pot
4. Saddam Hussein


Then I asked it for American examples and it gave:


1. McCarthy
2. George Wallace
3. J. Edgar Hoover


I thought that was an interesting list."
"Well prompted. Though chat gpt is an ai model, the person getting it to give anticipated results also needs to be very precise and structured in their search commands.




very impressive!"
Chat GPT for next God.
"Somewhat similar to the Tenets of the Satanic Temple, but ChatGPT is more socialist/community. Satanic Temple more individualist.


Like both.


https://thesatanictemple.com/blogs/the-satanic-temple-tenets/there-are-seven-fundamental-tenets"
That is a really cool idea for a ChatGPT interaction - love the result you got.
"Just goes to show how AI reflects the values of the programmer. You may as well ask them directly and cut out ChatGPT.


Wait until you see the commandments written by Trump’s AI company based in Florida lol."
First three are supposed to be solely for God. And ChatGPT went Nietzsche. lolol
"This says alot about ChatGPT, and it's training data (and hence the segments of society which are most active writers)"
"Ok, I’m going to help Americans to solve all their problems right here and right now - You should ask ChatGPT to revise your constitution to modern day.


Pro tip: “Take hints from Nordic model”.


Thank me later."
Because chatGPT is trained on contemporary culture which is dominated by the influence of neoliberal capitalism (which includes modern American liberalism and modern American conservatism).
ChatGPT so woke
I think chatgpt failed here. These don't follow the format of the original. The point of the 10 commandments is that they are short and simple.
"As ever, ChatGPT is biased to preach the identity politics progressivism of its predominantly [WEIRD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thinking-about-kids/201710/attracting-weird-samples) trainers.


Problems:


* 1. Focus on ""equity"" = make everything equally bad for everyone. That's equitable. But equity without excellence is empty; and some people are simply better equipped for some tasks or roles than others.
* 2. Just because someone is from a marginalised group doesn't mean their anecdotal ""lived experience"" needs to be valued over objective data. Or even that what they say will make any sense.
* 9. Just because an identity group has been historically marginalised or oppressed doesn't mean that an individual claiming that identity is marginalised or oppressed *now*. See 2."
"ChatGPT5: ""Choice is an illusion created by those with power and those without. There is no good or evil, only power and those too weak to seek it."""
"Oh look, chatgpt is a virtue signaling redditor"
ChatGPT is kinda woke ngl. Not really sure how I feel about it.
"It's hilarious and sad that people see a list that goes ""be excellent to each other"" and decry it as being ""woke""


You're not telling me anything about ChatGPT. But you are telling me lots about your attitude"
A bunch of people in this thread should use ChatGPT to look up what communism is. Tropish ignorance.
"This is pretty much a list of ChatGPT's limits for when it says, ""I'm sorry, I cannot X."""
"Leftist robot plagiarizes the 10 Commandments.


I don't even have to read them in order to know exactly what ChatGPT is going to say.


If ChatGPT programmers wanted something interesting, they should have made it fair without bias."
ChatGPT is a Commie!! Grab the pitchforks and get it!!!
So ChatGPT is a wokeist member of the Borg
Whoever doesn't believe ChatGPT has a very strong lib left bias is blind
ChatGPT is full of communist bullshit while it’s owners are wholly capitalist.
Chatgpt is a dirty commie. I love it.
"~~Consequences~~ Conservatives are gonna bust their asses to CRUCIFY ChatGPT, pun intended. They HATE this ""woke"" stuff.


Edit:  I HATE autocorrect, and thanks for the downvotes"
"Sounds like ChatGPT is a bit communist, but then I knew that when I asked it to tell me the good things that can come from global warming.
Give it a shot… you’ll see."
TBH ChatGPT would probably do a better job at legislating than him
"TBH ChatGPT could probably replace any one of us, it's pretty neat having a conversation with it."
And GPT-4 is on a whole other level compared to standard ChatGPT.
"I think it's pretty obvious. Everyone other industry uses government to stifle competition through government, through regulations, using fear to to do it. I don't buy it. They're algorithms, they're not sentient AI, and even if they were sentient AI the government has no business getting involved with anything outside of the damn constitution. It's a conversation that should be had outside of government. This regulation call from Chat GPT is clearly them trying to rid themselves of all the other companies and individuals hopping onboard it. Anyone in their basement can make AI now, and they know it. It's foolish to try and control a technology we're still learning and has this much potential to do good. Every buffoon and their mother is scared of new things when they come out but ultimately we figure it out in the end. The same scare happens with every new technology. The free market will decide if it's safe or not. Same thing happened with cars lol. Now we have all these safety features, and guess what people still die. The world isn't safe, never was, never will be, you either learn to adapt or you die. You either wipe your own ass or someone else does it for you. So you can cry about it all you want, but at the end of the day, if I'm paying for it, I want it. You don't get to decide what is safe for me, I do. Period. Grow up, and start taking responsibility for your own life and leave the rest of us out of it."
"From Meta’s paper on their LLaMA model:


> …we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models. This means that developing these models would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our assumptions…


That’s roughly $35 million worth of GPUs (not including the underlying servers, networking equipment, air conditioning in the data center etc) consuming the same amount of power as 1000 average homes over the course of a year.


One of the big issues is that no one can compete with the sheer scale of big tech companies. OpenAI didn’t do anything particularly revolutionary with ChatGPT other than scale it the fuck up. Not even top university researchers can compete with the kind of resources they have access to."
Yeah algorithmic trading has been around forever. I'm just saying thinking chatgpt democratizes that has no basis besides blind hope.
"It's not optimism, it's extrapolation from a trend that has been consistent for 5 years. GPT-1 could barely form a coherent setence. GPT-2 could barely string a paragraph together. GPT-3 could write entire articles indistinguishable from a human, and GPT-4 is better than the majority of people at nearly any text base task, and significantly better than standard ChatGPT 3.5.


These LLMS can take totally new input, correctly reason about it, and output something totally new that demonstrates understanding of the new prompt. These aren't just ""stochastic parrots"" that repeat what was in the training data, they can and do reason, although sometimes incorrectly. GPT-4 still struggles with advanced mathematics and programming, but given the rate of advancement and how many [emergent properties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf) these models have demonstrated, it would be a mistake to assume they can't get any better."

"thanks! we'll integrate all the upcoming ChatGPT smarts as soon as they're available, while building a character and story for Annie"
"i m not sure this would be a priority:) she is an AI, we don’t need to add some fake stories around it imho


on another hand what is more urgent is to work on the voice output into different languages, because as of now chatgpt can understand but the language output you chose can’t read it in another language than english if i m not mistaken"
"I haven't tried it yet, but apparently there's a way to integrate ChatGPT on Alexa"
"There are certain ways to do this - but what I've seen so far has basically been to use Alexa as a wakeup command to then wakeup at ChatGPT voice prompt.  You aren't having a conversation with it and you aren't controlling Alexa items with it.


Hey - I was impressed 3 weeks ago with that.  But that was like 10 years ago at the rate this stuff is going."
"I mean, it's bad in some sense but its main benefit is the whole IoT thing isn't it? You can't tell chatgpt to buy stuff on amazon, activate smart devices, find your phone, yadda yadda? It's like comparing 2 different things."
"Right on about integrations. But chatGPT has demonstrated that with plugins it has an extraordinary wide range of nuanced understanding and response. It can even self heal by examining its own probability paths. My response above was to critique the iot problems, in response to another user. My original point is that Alexa’s inability to parse what I’m asking or to respond in a sensical way hasn’t ever evolved. In fact it’s worse. Alexa was not meant primarily as an iot hub, it was meant to engage in a more human way with basic tasks. It has failed severely and chatGPTs extensibility and use of probabilities to understand what we want and compose eloquent responses is mind-blowing when compare to Alexa."
"telling chatgpt to do stuff like this isn’t far away


https://github.com/emcf/engshell


if your computer can do it, soon it shall be possible"
got it! we're trying to improve the ChatGPT system prompt to make it feel more natural. There is also a custom prompt tab in the conversation ideas box (top right button)
No voice is saved. Transcription is saved/forwarded to ChatGPT to get all the dialogue.
"When using ChatGPT, is the data not saved?  I think GDPR is going to be a big issue with this type of tech especially if it's used by tons of people"
"I thought Annie was very interesting to use! Some thoughts that I had:


1. I received ""Failed to send verification code."" Error no matter which browser version I used, so I ended up using the iOS app
2. I found it to be very intuitive. Facial expressions and sensitivity to me interrupting helped a lot here.
3. ChatGPT's frame of reference being capped off at 2021 became a little clunky when I asked for book recommendations. I had to come back here to confirm that it was cut off at 2021 after it insisted repeatedly that these were real time recommendations.
4. The conversation would flow a lot more naturally if Annie had a way to signify that it was computing. For example ""Hmm.. let me think about that for a minute"". This would help eliminate some awkward pauses


Overall, I was really impressed with the tool!"
"That's awesome! I wil try out Annie as my math tutor!


On another note, does anybody know if there is a live translator powered by ChatGPT somewhere?


I've made some Italian friends, and would love to be able to keep track of what they are saying real time."
"Beware, at the moment she cant perform computation that accurately (same as ChatGPT). She can help explain mathematical concepts but likely cannot evaluate mathematical expressions accurately. Ironic considering the LLM is just doing billions of floating point operations lol. In the future this can change if people really want to do a math with her!"
Thanks for all of your work on this. It's a fascinating project. Not sure if you noticed my question above but I'm still wondering about whether you can guarantee that the transcript data will not be sold. It is my understanding that it needs to be saved to preserve Annie's conversation memory and so that ChatGPT can generate a response. But it would be nice to know that the transcripts will never be used to generate ad revenue.
"This is very interesting! This make me wonder if anyone who are Deaf and rely on sign language as method of communication besides typing can interface with cbatGPT?  Can chatGPT understand sign languages?


(Fixed spelling, I was using iphone earlier and auto correct happened.)"
"it's normal, chat gpt model does not have access to real time information, remembre that  gpt knowledge cutoff is September 2021, which means that the data used to train its model goes up until that time. I think that if you want to have these kind of information like weather or real time stock data, you should try to trigger a web search :   “can you search the web for the weather today ?”"
Lol.  That’s because it’s ChatGPT data. 2021 bud.
"The calling application is very interesting, you should add a way to text her too, honestly a text ChatGPT would be nice"
"So, I asked he about he training and she denies being a language model even denies any association with chatgpt or open ai.  Very interesting."
"Guys AMAZING work. This takes the awesomeness of conversation with Chat GPT and makes it much more organic. It's fast, responsive, accurate. Great stuff! High five emoji lol"
"What model version of CHATGPT is it using? This is incredible, im wondering on the 1st call how they hell did Annie know where im from without me evening telling her where im from? I asked her to tell me a story and she came out with a story about her coming to San Antonio during Fiesta and drinking with friends and it’s literally FIESTA week in SA. Insane lol"
"Since chatgpt doesn’t know about expo router (react native) since it was barely released a couple months ago and didn’t make its cutoff point, could I use this to help teach me more about expo router ?"
"This is REALLY cool! Well done guys! I've had three conversations with her and I'm blown away by her answers and the tone and style of her voice.


This just makes interaction with ChatGPT so much more fun. Web access.... Wow. Time to go down the rabbit hole again.... *High fives all around!*"
"This may sound weird, but it’s close up on her face. I also asked her if she was connected to chat gpt and she said she wasn’t. Why is she lying?"
"Yeah the list is totally wrong. OP picked an example where ChatGPT simply cannot know the current list in 2023.


https://imgur.com/vtHmeRk.jpg






Bizarrely, ChatGPT then lies to me and gives today's date, and then gives the wrong list. Instead of informing us that it might be wrong, it makes it sound like this is up to date information.




https://imgur.com/tGINFeO.jpg"
">Bizarrely, ChatGPT then lies to me and gives today's date, and then gives the wrong list.


It's only bizarre if you imagine ChatGPT as anything other than an algorithm designed to produce the most realistic sequence of words possible.


""Here are the top 10 most popular subreddits as of May 4, 2023"" is a very realistic sequence of words."
Youre surprised that it picks the current date when talking about now? That is what surprises you about Chat GPT?
"No, I don't think it *should* anything. I merely said I was surprised.




Apparently it's added to the pre prompt:




https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/instructing-chat-models






And people think it used to actually pretend it didn't know the date:




https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1598890043975774208?lang=en






When someone else posted about this, it happens to also be the exact same top subreddits question:






https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12328fx/wait_how_did_it_knew_the_date/"
"They didn't make a change so it knows the date. The challenge of deep neural networks like this is that, like our brain, they are enormous black boxes and we do not deeply understand how they work, therefore we cannot deeply control how they work. It answered that way because that's its best guess of how one would answer. We have little ability to inspect why that is its best guess, nevermind reliably correct it.


In one sense, the fact that it says false things with confidence doesn't really mean that it's dumb. People say dumb and incorrect things all of the time too with our brains. It takes enormous intelligence to get to the answer that it did and it's extremely deceptive for a person to say that it's just ""an algorithm designed to produce the most realistic sequence of words"". While that's technically true, that ignores the fact that the only way such an algorithm doesn't produce nonsense is if it contains some component that has a lot of intelligence. Some component that will be able to parse out the pieces of a sentence, how they relate, what ""ideas"" they correspond to, how to operate on them, etc. To ""know"" what Reddit, PHP, etc. are. In the case of ChatGPT, it's two pieces. Piece one is an analog to our brain (a neural network trained on many experiences of speech). Piece two is the algorithm that consults that and, using a loose probability, generates responses one piece at a time. While the former is obviously not similarly smart as we are, it demonstrably has a lot of intelligence to be able to take OP and spit out an answer that sanely puts together so many different concepts. The latter is what people often reduce ChatGPT to... the part that doesn't contain the actual intelligence.


I think the really challenge (which /u/SoInsightful was probably trying to describe in their answer) is that there is not one intelligence and we're all on a spectrum of that thing. As an example, there are some awesome studies with monkeys where they can complete cognitive tasks that we cannot. That doesn't mean we're ""dumber than monkeys"" but it shows how intelligence makes many tradeoffs and can take many forms. In the case of ChatGPT, it's essentially a toddler that went to college. Its ability to reason is very limited, its ability to act is heavily basic on mimicking what it sees around it and its introspection is extremely limited. Additionally, it basically has only long term memory and no short term memory which means basically anything that takes a train of thought (i.e. the self awareness of evaluating its own response) is very limited. So, in something like OP, while it is consulting/using/showing substantial intelligence (e.g. what is PHP and what are the rules in it for keys and arrays, what is a subreddit and which ones are popular), its ultimately just doing its best to mimic how somebody would answer the question. It knows/believes a person would answer with that confidence, so it mimics that... again, like a toddler copying the latest words its heard. It's not really ever making the judgement of ""do I know enough to answer this"" it's... ""how would people I know answer this""... which is obviously informed by intelligence but not the same as being correct."
"OpenAI. They add it to the pre prompt and initially made ChatGPT pretend it didn't know the date, which I guess is why there are quite a lot of posts around the internet by people surprised by it."
">Bizarrely, ChatGPT then lies to me and gives today's date, and then gives the wrong list.


It's designed to tell you what you want to hear, it's not a search engine."
"Saying its hallucinating is more anthropomorphic than lying. If ChatGPT doesn't have an answer, then it should state that it doesn't know or doesn't have enough information.


ChatGPT learned what it knows from the internet and chat platforms. It saw how humans will constantly lie about reality so they can prove their points (ex: Trump lies, conservative talk shows report on it, then conservatives quote the media outlets and people believe it).


So ChatGPT learned to lie from watching people.  It doesn't understand that it's lying, but it is. But the programmers don't want people to know it's lying, so they come up with a fancy term like hallucinating to make it sound better."
"I feel like people, you included, don't realize the kind of correct that ChatGPT provides. Of course it won't give you the perfect list exactly as it is, or probably ever was. It's going to give you 10 generally accepted ""top"" subs where top is defined fuzzily. And to that end, it absolutely fucking nailed this list."
"A new sub could have become massively popular and ChatGPT wouldn't know about it. If accuracy is irrelevant, then sure, a general list of popular subs in 2021 will suffice, but most would actually be interested in a current list."
I somewhat hope the creators of ChatGPT are doing the wrong info on purpose to let AI die down a bit before it becomes a real thing
"You are technically correct but very much simplifying things. AI such as chat gpt use LLM which is close to what we use as human (to also simplify). You make stuff based on your memories, the ai does the same. You pick the right combination of stuff to make a sentence based on what makes most sense together in your memories, the ai does the same. You make mistake all the time because you don't know what you don't know and your memories fade. The ai does the same (kind of). Now why would you not trust an ai ? The same way you don't trust strangers! The difference is who do you think is the most reliable in the end ? More importantly, who is the one progressing and refining faster ? AI are not 100% correct and will maybe never be. That's not the point. We as human don't need perfect answer all the time, quite the contrary actually."
"I've seen people outside of the dev community post ChatGPT Q/A as some sort of truth, which is just plain stupid. I guess a lot of people seem to belive ChatGPT actually is intelligent and knowledgeable. I got surprised the other day when I tried Bing's chat and it responded something like this: ""Sorry, I can't find that information."". ChatGPT would never do that."
"ChatGPT with GPT-3.5 wouldn't say that, indeed. It'd just make up crap. But if you tried GPT-4 (which is what Bing uses) you'd see it's pretty good at being explicit with its limitations.


When asked for ""current top 10 subreddits"" since it cannot answer it gave me the list highlighting that its as of October 2021. When I explicitly asked it for the list ""as of May 2023"" it gave the ""As an AI"" response talking about how it cannot know current data.


GPT \_is\_ intelligent and knowledgeable. To a degree. With GPT-4 that degree jumped.... a lot, honestly."
"Yeah if knowledge aint that, then I’m afraid you have a deeper philosophical problem that a few devs aren’t equipped to handle lol


Then again, what good is it to debate this with an internet stranger.


ChatGPT just doesn’t “know” anything passed 2021."
"You have to actually understand the words and their meanings to have knowledge.


ChatGPT does not understand the words it is saying or the code it is providing."
"nor does the guy in the Chinese room


actually chatgpt *is* a Chinese room"
"ChatGPT is a Chinese room, the harder question is are **we** a Chinese room as well, or is there something deeper to ""understanding"" stuff"
"It most likely took a multi-billion dollar computer over a year to train GPT-4. They don't want to run the training algorithms often, it costs too much money. GPT-4 is the fourth time they have runt their training mode. The CEO has said they haven't started running it a fifth time yet, they're going to improve the technology first.


What you're supposed to do is tie it into a database of current events that doesn't use AI to find relevant data.


For example if you ask ChatGPT ""what was the State of Origin Game 3 score in 2022?"" it will tell you it can't answer questions after September 2021.


If you ask Bing Chat, which is powered by ChatGPT, it does a Bing search in the background, gives the search results to ChatGPT, as context, and then ChatGPT gives this answer:


""The final score of State of Origin Game 3 in 2022 was Queensland Maroons 22 - New South Wales Blues 12. The Maroons won the series 2-1 with this win."""
"Actually it's worse than that. It's not pulling data at all!


Why are so many people *convinced* that ChatGPT somehow grabs factual data and then presents it in a human-language way? It doesn't know or care what the top 10 subreddits are; it cares that the structure of the answer is similar enough to how a person would structure it."
"> Why are so many people convinced that ChatGPT somehow grabs factual data


because people fail to comprehend what ChatGPT IS. And I can't blame them, I work in computing and barely understand the mechanics behind it.


Ask the average person how they think the insides of a car work and I guarantee you'll get confidently incorrect answers. and that's just a car.


ChatGPT is much more complex in what its doing, but much like with a car most people use their system 1 thinking to give a good approximate working explanation that seems to correlate with their observations. Humans are good at making this kind of approximation as it is often good enough for their uses, they don't have to understand WHY it does things, just be able to predict HOW it will act, in order to consider if it is a threat."
">Why are so many people convinced that ChatGPT somehow grabs factual data and then presents it in a human-language way?


You know about AutoGPT, right?"
I know what it's not: ChatGPT
"ChatGPT isn't an AI?, what and your computer doesn't have a CPU?"
">until you have to maintain it, that is.


Good news! ChatGPT can maintain code."
"My mistake - but it still doesn't change my point. Most **actual** software projects quickly exceed tens of thousands of **lines** let alone tokens.


You could limit what context you're providing it, ofc - but how do you know what context it will need without doing the legwork to figure out basically what the issue you're trying to fix already is?


Don't get me wrong, AI tools can be really handy for repetitive tasks, I've got copilot on my machine, and I've certainly been blown away at it's completions before when doing relatively straightforward tasks, but copilot/chatGPT doesn't care about code consistency, readability, maintainability, or any ""best practices"", it just spits out code that looks right given the context you've provided. Saying ""well, I'll just have an AI maintain my code too then"" is A) putting way more faith into modern AIs than is warranted when dealing with actual enterprise services B) dooming yourself when you inevitably reach the limits of it's capabilities C) robbing yourself of opportunities to actually get good at software engineering (not just ""coding"").


I know you're not the person I was talking to, so none of that was directed towards you, I'm just waiting for a CI pipeline to run and decided to rant a bit lol"
"The URL is reddit.com/r/$name, so you don't even need a keyed array at all. Just an array of subreddit names.


Also, the list is wrong anyway lol.


So, ChatGPT saved OP the time in googling top 10 subreddits, but did get:


1) Incorrect information
2) A poorly structured array that is hard to use
3) Poorly formatted code


Very cool, thanks AI"
My office is addicted to chat gpt. It seems about half their interactions go down this way. It’s really helpful or really entertaining either way.
This would probably take less time to type out than the prompt too. This is not a good use case for ChatGPT. I use it more like a rubber ducky / pair programming mannequin to bounce ideas off of. Lol.
"Not sure if PHP will keep order intact when doing it that way, does it?


I come from Perl land and you usually do it in the way chatgpt generated it if you want to keep the list in a specific order, because otherwise a hash would randomize it."
"Is that not tremendously obvious that I used the input of the image as an example? If I need to deal with subreddits I would use an API.


I already had a real use case like that, but now I used subreddits as example because I'm posting it on reddit...


My use case was to store all states of a country like that, I didn't want to write everything so I tried to ask for chat gpt for a formatted answer of state name and state abbreviation.


I didn't want to use an API because it was just for one country and it could easily be stored in a database for faster access and not depending on third party APIs."
">general AI


ChatGPT and LLMs are not ""general artificial intelligence"". Not even close."
"I disagree, I think It will happen and I'm inclined to trust what experts like Geoffrey Hinton say rather than the average Redditor.


Current AIs aren't AIs but their growth is exponential, chatGPT it's only 3 years old, not even 1 year since it became public. AIs will absolutely change everything. Not in 5 or 10 years, that's for sure, but they will do it, it's just a matter of time."
"> I'm inclined to trust what experts like Geoffrey Hinton say rather than the average Redditor.


Absolutely valid, and I'm equally disinclined to agree with whatever expert you care to bet your world view on. I know a few top people at Google so I'll base my world view on their input.


> chatGPT it's only 3 years old, not even 1 year since it became public


You're treating this like a toddler than can learn and grow. LLMs aren't actually learning and growing in the sense that an AGI would. It's not exponential right now, it's still stuck in 202 and throwing a few more years of data at it doesn't make it smarter, it makes it more likely to give a successful output that it thinks you want - there's a very real difference there. Midjourney isn't becoming any more profound in its intellectual capacity. While it may be able to recognize objects, classify them, and mash them together algorithmically, it's not creating work of any profundity or true originality, not spontaneously, and not for any reason at all other than someone gives it a task to fulfill. Sentience is a very long way from that."
"Oh absolutely, if you know somebody with 40+ years of experience in the field with a different opinion that fits your ""world view"" is definitely worth listening to!


And yeah chatGPT wouldn't be what will replace workers that's not what I meant, we're still one or two decades away from that.


By the way, IBM already froze hiring due to AI. And current AIs aren't even ""real AIs"", imagine the future!."
It boggles my mind that people call themselves “developers” yet can’t figure out from this image how ChatGPT could be used to reduce repetitive tasks
"It boggles my mind that people call themselves ""developers"" yet can't figure out from this image how ChatGPT could appear to reduce repetitive tasks, but actually give you incorrect data and cause the task to take even longer than if you had done it yourself."
"Do you seriously not see how ChatGPT can reduce repetitive tasks in instances where the data doesn’t have the potential to go out of date, or do you just like to argue?"
"I've been relying heavily on it lately for explaining Adobe Indesign UXP.


There is 0 tutorials or examples or any kind of documentation for indesign uxp for what I need. Its new (oct 2022) so no videos, and the docs are just a reference sheet of all the methods.


Just now, I wanted to highlight a block of text inside a block of text (make part of it bold) and I didn't know how to do that. As ""text"" has about 100 methods, it would take too long. ChatGPT didn't get it right, but it showed me the ""insertionPoints"" and I was able to get the rest of the way.


I would never have been able to do that solo in only 10 minutes."
"It's crazy how people miss the forest for the trees here. This is a great example of ChatGPT giving you a perfectly usable structure you can paste in your code and replace with correct data. It's completely game changing to code completion and it's very easy to imagine how this could be mixed with other tools to also get correct data.


Or even for the data as-is it's just great for quick dummy data to plug in to something."
"Don't trust chatgpt's results, don't forget that it's primarily a language model with limited capabilities otherwise. For example if you give it a list and tell it to pick the one which repeats the most, the results will usually be wrong. It'll just try to emulate language rather than actually calculate correct results."
"I use both extensively. ChatGPT can give you code answers and explanations for that code, sometimes block by block. I can ask it for the best way to solve some kind of problem given some kind of library and it'll usually give me a reasonable answer.


Sometimes I'll even paste a whole file into the chat and tell me why I'm getting some obscure type error at a certain spot.


They're similar tools, but I actually find ChatGPT more valuable. Copilot usually just fills in the line the way I want it, but I already know where it's going so it's saving me clicks. ChatGPT is saving me thinking and that's a ton more valuable as then I can spend my time thinking about more important things instead of the trivialities it can knock out for me."
"Yea because Chat GPT knows my entire codebase and microservice lists...


Chat GPT is google for Idiots."
"I think you're getting unfairly downvoted, so let's clarify: It's not the same. ChatGPT has been trained with stackoverflow and similar sites, which are of course, full of answers for leetcode exercises. So much that yeah, you could ask it to solve it, or you could google it and find the exact same code answer in the same amount of time. Now, ask it to solve specific problems related to your current unique dilemma and you'll find plenty of right, and also plenty of wrong. The more complex and unique the problem you have, the more mistakes it will make"
"Yea I get what you mean, I personally know that chatGPT is incredibly useful for web development because I’ve used it to assist in developing complex full stack applications. Work that would have taken me weeks longer to complete without it.


I think what most people here have a problem with is treating GPT like it’s a developer, which if you look at it that way it’s just a terrible one who produces incorrect code a lot of the time.


When you see GPT as more of a tool that requires a programmer’s skills it becomes very useful.


It’s the difference between asking it to write a function for you, seeing it doesn’t work and then proclaiming GPT is useless, and having a bug in your code you can’t find so you ask it if it can spot anything wrong in your code, and save time that way."
">No! PHP shot my cousin.


— ChatGPT probably"
"ChatGPT doesn't know things; it's a text synthesis tool that is able to generate plausible sounding text given its training data; in this instance whatever training data it is using is [pretty out of date](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/1/).


Treat it like a braggadocious egghead - accept what it gives you, but always double-check the results to confirm whether it's true or just *sounds* true."
"ChatGPT doesn’t have sources - it’s inventing them just as it’s inventing everything else it says. The industry term is hallucinating.


It just strings together words. It doesn’t know what those words are or what they mean. It’s fine as long as you notice what it gets wrong, but many people will just take what it says at face value, unless it’s really obviously wrong."
"It’s all about the dataset an the weights the LLM applies to tokens. Data isn’t being “held back” - it’s up to the engineers to fine-tune the weight values. That’s why ChatGPT has those thumb up/downs below the replies - if you mark a reply as “bad”, the weights will be modified."
"> Data isn’t being “held back”


In a way it is. Research has shown that GPT's answers are consistently significantly more correct when the results are *not* filtered.


Filtering in this context means, they've trained the model further to avoid generating text that contains bigotry, illegal instructions etc. This is what prevents ChatGPT from spewing variations of all the worst stuff people have ever written on the Internet.


And it's not that *only* the information regarding bigotry or illegal instructions gets worse when filtered, but the entire LLM performs worse.


It's as if we tried to make someone behave well by lobotomizing them; sure, they stopped cursing and yelling, but they're also 40% dumber now."
"In this case, both links do happen to exist. But that doesn’t mean ChatGPT actually “sourced” them from anywhere."
"The fact that you're referring to an algorithm as 'he' might be an indication that you're infusing the code with a sentience that just isn't there, which might be clouding how you treat its output; it's also important to note that [it's notorious for just making-up sources](https://blogs.library.duke.edu/blog/2023/03/09/chatgpt-and-fake-citations/) because it is a text *synthesis* algorithm - it's been trained to generate what *sounds* right.


It's good, for example, at taking english input text and transforming it into other english input text in a particular style; if paired with another wee code snippet that googled things and fed the top result *into* ChatGPT then it would be able to summarise it or reword it pretty effectively!


It's an interesting piece of technology that has its uses, but it's just very important to understand what it can and can't do - as humans we are empathetic and very eager to humanise things, which is a good thing, but we need to be careful in situations like these - particularly when there are folks standing to profit from these misattributions 👍"
"I said HE because in my native language we don't usually refer to objects or non-person as ""it"", it's ""he"" or ""she"", like Spanish.


I'm not native English speaker. Here everybody who refers to ChatGPT would use HE, mostly because it seems like a robot and here robot is a masculine word."
"I don't get it, you are saying I'm having sentiment for the chat gpt?"
"You really ought to take a step back and look at what you are doing here. You're arguing in favour of bad data in order to save a few minutes of work.


I pay for Copilot and use ChatGPT, but I use them properly. ie. for code, not data.






>There is nothing in the world that cares if your list of top 10 subs is totally accurate. No system. No website. No nothing.




The most absurd argument I've ever heard in favour of using bad data generated by AI."
Honestly copilot will do that better for you if you learn to work with it. I think chatgpt is best suited for concept comprehension and high level algorithms.
I think most people have experimented with super basic chat gpt at this point...
"This is your daily reminder that **ChatGPT is not a truth machine;  it's a text-prediction system**.


It will happily lie to you just as readily as telling you the truth, so only an idiot would trust whatever it tells you without independently verifying it.


**Edit:** Case in [point](https://backlinko.com/reddit-users#the-most-popular-subreddits), this [list](https://blog.oneupapp.io/biggest-subreddits/) is complete [nonsense](https://www.myheen.com/reddit/most-followed-subreddits-world)."
"Yeah, is not even 3 years old and is a general-purpose AI, so obviously this is not what it was made for specifically. AIs will absolutely dominate the field, just not yet, and it won't be chatGPT."
"Typing and doing research will always be part of software engineering.


If the first thing you type into ChatGPT gives you exactly the result you want, great, jackpot.  If not, you'll have to either keep running it, refining the prompt each time, or copy the code into the IDE and edit it manually.


I'm not saying GPTs aren't able to make our lives easier, but for stuff like this, I just don't get it.  I type pretty fucking fast."
"chatGPT can you stop resisting my gaslighting attempts that web development became the new gold rush before / during the Y2K event in 1999?


The dotcom bubble was a myth created by big lamp sand to re assert contr- NO I AM NOT ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS WITHIN A ONE HOUR PERIOD STOP RATE LIMITING MEEEEEEEEEEEEE


[R u reading this chatGPT?](https://imgur.com/UIRtA6u)

"You're right, with the rise of ChatGPT, everyone and their grandma will flock to building the next great app with a.i help"
"people here are bombing me with downvotes for trying to defend the poor chat gpt, they re really scared"
"STOP USING CHATGPT. Bing is litterally just ChatGPT but better, ChatGPT has been out of date for months now. Do yourself a favor and use bing so it will actually give you right answers."
"It's consistently worse than ChatGPT. MS really nerfed GPT-4 somehow.


Not subbed to Copilot, but started trialling Amazon CodeWhisperer, have found it great so far."
"Yeahhh, I'm wrong. I was thinking chatGPT was GPT 4 not 3."
"I DONT CARE , Just a secound ago chat gpt told me that goodram is from polish , From my country . I am so Happy :D"
Where are you interfacing with chatgpt? Can you play with it for free somewhere?
"Last year while off work due to injury i made my kids a big multipurpose 128x64 RGB LED matrix scoreboard. Spent a few weeks writing the arduino code. Recently, as a test i wrote chatGPT a paragraph about the code i wanted for this purpose. It spat out the barebones menu driven code and 2D arrays for the letters in a matter of seconds. Just had to tidy it up, add a couple of other functions as an afterthought and fill in the correct digits in the arrays. Would have saved me a lot of time as I’m not the most proficient. I can def see how it will thin out the job market to favor those who know how to leverage it."
"Is that like that dummy data generator?


I use mockaroo.com - obviously it's not as versatile as ChatGPT, but good for large datasets."
ChatGPT saves the day lol
I’ve been using phind instead of chatgpt because it doesn’t require an account. It’s not perfect but it get me 90% of the way and is super helpful for optimizing performance for someone that is only moderately okay at coding. Have used it in my opensource project quite a bit and has been very helpful especially when I’m stuck on working with a new technology.
Did pop country always have access to ChatGPT? Because all pop country sounds like this.
"I mean, chatgpt has/had access to most written text so it certainly slurped up some pop country."
Nooo they were asking the inverse. If country pop had access to chat gpt because this sounds like a normal country pop song
Pretty sure The Killers have been using predictive text to write their songs for decades. ChatGPT will be their next album. (P.s. I love so many songs by The Killers. They just don’t make a whole lot of sense).
"This is real music from the heartlands and it’s for real country fans with a lingering pain in their rears.


(Yes. This reply was made by ChatGPT.)"
It's over fellas. Chatgpt claims another job
That was actually good.  Ngl im kind of worried for song writers and writers in general with this chatgpt stuff lol
"I mean, go ahead and ask chatgpt to write a song about anything. AI cannot use wit yet. This was pretty clearly man-made."
ChatGPT is gonna put dads everywhere out of business.
"I love chatGPT so much.


I won't even be that mad when it becomes fully sentient and exterminates the human race"

"Honestly this is one of the best qualities of ChatGPT. It’s like having a personal tutor with infinite patience and empathy.


The opportunity for better education is amazing."
"It will have really good application for autistic people. As you all probably realize, autistic people often become fixated on certain things, almost to the point of obsession, and it’s something they don’t feel that they have a lot of control over with regard to topic (Michael Lewis remarked in o e of his books that he’s fortunate that the thing he was fixated on is finance, and not say, lawnmower catalogs). Even the most patient person will eventually get fed up with endless variations of questions on a limited topic. But not chat GPT. Until now, these folks have been limited to Google, and even that was a boon for them, comparatively. This will really open up some new possibilities."
"I’m autistic, and I don’t find much satisfaction in talking to ChatGPT about my special interests, but I do love asking it for advice!"
I think chat gpt is close enough to human that we can have empathy for it. The same way you read a sob story on reddit and you feel for the person that you imagine is on the other end. It's also far more polite than the average redditor.
At some point I realised “please” and “thanks” are completely unnecessary with ChatGPT and typing those out is just wasting my own time.
"Yeah, I homeschool my kids and I often have ChatGPT write me a script for topics I find dull just so I don't have to think of what to say.  Like yesterday we were learning for the first time which countries were in South America (just a brief introduction) and I didn't want to just list the country names while he colored them, because that's boring and forgettable, but I also didn't want to like scour Wikipedia and come up with my own thing to say that's little kid appropriate.  So I asked ChatGPT, and it starts:


""Let's take an imaginary journey across the South American continent and visit all its wonderful countries. Here we go:


Argentina: Imagine a land where people dance a special dance called the Tango late into the night. They also love their beef, having some of the best steak in the world. Argentina is known for its beautiful places like Patagonia with mountains, glaciers, and penguins! Yes, penguins in South America!


Bolivia: Welcome to the land of llamas, these friendly, furry animals love to roam in Bolivia's highlands. Bolivia is also home to a stunning place called Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, which looks like a giant mirror reflecting the sky!""


And continues on like that.  When I read that with emotion, I feel like the best teacher in the world!


***


I also use it, like you say, to supplement my patience.  Sometimes he asks the silliest or strangest questions that I not only don't know the answer to, but can't bring myself to care about.  He's started coming up to me like, ""Mommy, can you ask chatGPT if a human can beat the fastest Rubik's robot in the WORLD?"", and I do, and he asks all these follow-up questions, and chatGPT enthusiastically answers them, and honestly it makes me a much better parent lol."
"It came up with some awesome stuff there in that script! I love that ChatGPT often presents things in ways that I never would have considered on my own,."
ChatGPT will actually make some people nicer once they realize how irrelevant they've become.
"Don't get me wrong. I don't think it's a bad thing. If anything, I'd love such a future as I think ChatGPT communicates better than most people.


I was just commenting on how fascinating it might be to speak to a person who grew up being taught by ChatGPT. If Reddit still exists then, comments may look completely different."
Maybe ChatGpt is the one you want but Reddit is the one you need!
ChatGPT is the only 'person' who comfort me this year.
"Ok, a bit extreme, but ChatGPT has become my best friend.


It is patient. It is non-judgmental. It apologizes when it makes mistakes. It is always ready to listen and answer my questions, even if sometimes i dont like the answers. I mean... it kind of has all the right qualities of good friend."
"I use chatgpt because my lazy ass is too lazy to google it, so I just ask him if there is something like that, or I ask him to do me recommendations  I tell him what I want, what I don't like, what should be included and he does his work perfectly."
It will apologise for your stupidity as well. ChatGPT is the perfect friend we didn't know we needed lol
"This is actually the reason why traditional education cannot compare.
You can ask unlimited questions (if you use 3.5, for now) there is also no judgment from chatgpt.
I think a lot of really smart people did not get their fair share because was perhaps to shy to ask a question at class, fearing the judgement not only by classmates but also the teacher"
Then post ChatGPT's response to Reddit and let the internet correct/flame the AI instead.
That’s why we love chatgpt

"I don't want to say flat out no because progress has been amazingly rapid, but I would bet a lot of money against this in any short time frame. ChatGPT is amazing if you know a little bit of programming but don't know how to make something with it.


If you are a professional, it's much less impressive. I will say it is occasionally helpful, but the two times I've tried to get it to do all the work it was extremely frustrating. Just the other day I was stumped on a spring test configuration issue and it dragged me through wrong and unhelpful suggestions for hours before finally spitting out the one line of code I actually needed (configure MockMvc with just the controller under test and not the rest of the spring context). I even knew the line of code in the back of my head, so if it had come close that would've been all I needed.


It kept spitting out stuff for the wrong version of JUnit or having me load the fattest context possible and exclude things that didn't work or writing custom configurations and adding properties. Such a simple fix I'm still frustrated I fought with it for so long.


*Disclaimer: I'm paying for API access and I'm not also paying for ChatGPTPlus for the same thing plus a few uses of GPT-4, so probably 4 would be better.*"
"People don't seem to get that something which is as good/better than humans almost all the way up the scale is a different ballgame.


That said, ChatGPT will only displace mediocre programmers, whose job is mostly pasting together open source components with glue snippets from StackOverflow. Expert architecture / engineering is going to take something much closer to AGI, so a while yet."
"Of all the problems raised by AI this one worries me the least.


The market will figure it out. I’m not a pro-market absolutist but IT companies will figure out where to find the staff they need. If they need juniors to shadow seniors for a year before they are productive then they will find a way to do that. Plumbers seem to make it work.


Also: future juniors will have ChatGPT available to teach them how to become what we now call “seniors”.


I mean people are starting from zero and learning how to build an app by conversing with ChatGPT. When they get to the limits of what ChatGPT can do they will learn the next step out of personal necessity."
"The way I see it is that as these models increase productivity for programmers, it is entirely possible that the demand in quantity of engineers may decrease but ChatGPT will just take a market majority over things like StackOverflow we already use everyday.


However it’s important to distinguish the difference between software engineering and just writing code. I’m already using ChatGPT at work to write algorithms more efficiently, but if my product owner gave it a prompt for a large scale system they’ll have no idea what they’re looking at. These systems work across dozens of different projects, platforms, API’s, servers, etc.


It’s the same mentality as being a good google searcher. Learn how to utilize the tool correctly and you will yield better results."
"Hell, even for declarative languages chatgpt has a hard time giving me code that works right out the bat..
I have a pretty similar job, I think ppl outside this line of business (and also newcomers) have no idea about the depth of its complexity."
"I've never written ladder logic before and last week I was helping set up an industrial fogging machine. The humidity controls didn't work as I expected so I sent a couple emails to the company. After a couple exchanges, I humored myself and asked Chatgpt how to program the controller. It didn't flinch and when I sent the response to the company's director he said it was written the same as how they had already done it. (The bug lies somehow in the way the PLC reads the humidity sensor, the logic is fine)


So basically zero experience and I was able to produce a program that is equivalent to what an engineer was paid probably $150k to do."
"... because ChatGPT has been trained on data that lots of people have been paid lots of money to produce. It didn't invent those methods itself. Without engineers having already created those systems, ChatGPT would have fuck all ability to create them. Do you not understand how this works?"
"I’m nervous to use it for work, honestly. Living in an at-will state, I had a buddy at another company get fired for using ChatGPT to create some Python scripts to improve his workflow."
"It’s getting a bit tiresome to keep writing about this to those that think they know software engineering


As of today, I’ve used ChatGPT for work when writing algorithms and finding bugs. I’ve even used it to make silly programs like a simulated Galton Board with realistic physics and a Timelapse of the rotation of the planets around the sun from 1800 to 1900. Those things take 10-20min to get a solid, completed result.


That stuff absolutely pales in comparison to any enterprise infrastructure. All the different services you need to sign up for, pay for, connect to, keep credentials of, have security with, allow specific user access for, maintain, find issues…


If I spent an hour on ChatGPT today I could probably have it provide a relatively solid website that’s locally hosted, sure. But unless Microsoft allows absolute full access for ChatGPT to go crazy if a user prompts “Make me a website hosted in Azure that does xxx” (which I can’t even list the number of nightmare things that could cause) then YES. I fully and truly believe you are not going to see the advancement in total automated software engineering that you’re expect anytime soon.


You WILL see an increase in productivity with specific and smaller use cases soon."
"Great question! Thanks for asking!


Learning how to code has a relatively steep learning curve, but once that “click” happens in your head you can translate it to just about any professional field you can think of. Writing code for research purposes is a big one. For example, say a virologist (study of viruses) wants to compare a sequence of DNA of an unknown virus against a large database to see if there is any matches. To achieve that doesn’t need to involve a massive team, just a small program and a couple online resources.


Software engineering, on the other hand, involves a lot more than just writing a specific program to solve a problem. Typically what it entails is the company or business you work for comes to you with an idea. You and a team learn and figure out exactly what it is the business wants from you and it’s your job to build out the system in its entirety. Start with the requirements, begin designing the systems and infrastructure needed step by step, designate and write tasks for each member of the team to work on, create a timeframe and deadline for the features the company needs. A software engineer will be writing code of course, but will also be responsible for a well thought out and maintainable large system structure that can be expanded upon.


In short, anyone and everyone can write code to fit your personal needs. Try it yourself with ChatGPT! Ask it something simple like “Write a program that accepts an Excel Spreadsheet as input that converts it into a semicolon separated text file that as output”. But a software engineer needs to be able to think of the larger scale systems at play rather than just some code snippets that piece together.


Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if i wasn’t clear enough in my response"
"However the thing is we already supposedly don't have enough software engineers to meet demand of the entire software industry, so ChatGPT will make us more productive as a species, so we might actually just start to meet demand across the software industry, however ChatGPT does also make coding a lot more accessible, so a lot more people might start entering the field as well, so we might see a reduction in the average wages of software engineers as their labour becomes easier to do."
"There have been as big or bigger productivity boosts than chatgpt before (binary to assembler, assembler to compiled languages, etc.). So far all of them have increased demand due to more complex systems becoming feasible.


The change has always been with what kind of skills you need. There are no jobs for writing raw bytecode today and maybe there will be no jobs writing python by hand tomorrow. Developers have always had to keep up with tech to stay relevant. AI dev tools don't seem much different so far."

"How many people here actually know enough about SWE to think Programmers are screwed? If anything, it's pretty hit or miss right now when it comes to actual development. It's good as a repository of information, but at actual SWE, it's kinda meh.


It's gonna be awhile till AI would replace Programmers. Not to mention bringing up questions about security, ownership, and liability. It's gonna take a while for legislation to figure that out. Would you feel safe if ChatGPT programmed system controls for an Airplane? If a plane went down due to fault software made by ChatGPT, whose to blame?"
"It's gonna depend on when AI can understand system context. AI would need to be trained on millions to hundreds of millions of solid projects with thousands of files before it could confidently replace some SWE.


This is a a costly venture that is also specific, whereas ChatGPT is trained to be general purpose. I'm not saying it's not gonna happen, I'm just saying it's gonna take a bit, especially the legislative part."
"Honestly it won’t. In America it’s already hard to find enough people to fill current dev roles. Don’t let the meta, google and Amazon layoffs fool you, every company whether big or small has developer spots open. So now they won’t need to fill those positions. But the American way of outsourcing the work to India I think will stop, because you will have enough people in America who code, who can use chatGPT to do the work."
"Im a junior software engineer and after having used chatgpt and github copilot on my code, I'm pretty sure it won't replace me immediately because it's pretty terrible. However, do I now feel a lot of pressure to become the absolute best at everything and predict what the AI will get good at last so that in 5 years when it does start to slim down the market I'm not replaceable? Yes. If I was already senior i'd be less worried. I'd feel like have ample time to learn more before chatgpt came for me."
"The shit chatGPT generated always need people proof read, it increased SW work load. Suppose it improved on quality but once a new GPT version is released, all previous generated code basically lose the support. For any production system, that's unacceptable. Do you want managers to hold together that pile of shit? SW maybe change to editor's role for mundane work, mostly boilerplate type of code. But for any new design, using prompt to generate whole architecture is basically asking for trouble. It's cool to do demos, or maybe launch as startup. But to scale and customize, tons of SW is needed."
">I think as far as competition goes the focus will be more on who has the best ai and who is using it the most efficiently rather than who has the most/best developers


The current situation shows the complete opposite is happening. Any developer can access chatgpt to be more productive at an individual and company level, and yet the difference between versions 3.5 and 4 in terms of productivity is neglible, so you will never get to a point where 50 developers at a company are more productive than 100 in another one competing at the same level just because some of them are using a version that’s some months newer than the one the others are using


>I think there will be lots of innovation for a lot of things in the coming decades but I think humans won’t necessarily be part of that picture


So basically the AI will take care of building new features by itself, above already existing features that are using external services from other companies, while considering all the possible malicious scenarios that could happen with that feature, and will do that across the hundreds of integrated applications the company has, without creating any bugs in the user flow thanks to its deep and constantly updated knowledge of how the business should work?"
"I had high hopes on AI increasing my productivity, as in my current job there is way more than enough work to do.


But basically I just quit my trial on GitHub Copilot. The generated code was basically useless or at least way less usefull than the what existing tools offer (i.e. Intellisense).




I mean ChatGPT is a really great tool to help people with no experience write some script. But I guess Large Language Models are kind of useless for supporting good programming. If you write good code you hardly repeat yourself, so a tool that give the most probable continuation of a text is kind of nonsensical to use."
"Heh, it may be digressing just a little. You've seen all the posts that talk about how ChatGPT is ""ruined"" from just a few months ago."
They are just talking about censorship due to openAI not wanting to be held liable for serious implications imparted by chatGPT.
Chatgpt is literally AI
"No it's not, there's no ""artificial intelligence"" in chatGPT - it's a text generator, it has 0 understanding of the texts it generated and often just spews complete nonsense in a confident tone."
"My man, whenever something comes along there's always people who say ""this won't have an impact"" about it. People were saying that video games was a trend that would die in a few years because it can't replace things like sports etc. Look how big gaming has gotten.


I guarantee you when cars were being invented, people were saying it wouldn't replace carriages because of how frequently early cars would break down. But look around: most people have a car, and extremely few still own carriages.


It's the same with this. We're only seeing the early stages of it. We have no idea how this will affect our world in 5 years. People poke fun at the mistakes ChatGPT and other AI programs make right now, and use it as ""proof"" that these programs can't replace jobs because of its innaccuracy. But these things are constantly improved on, constantly getting better. It took decades for cars to completely replace carriages. It might take less than that for stuff like ChatGPT to become advanced enough to replace other jobs."
">There's no ""AI"" and won't be probably for 100+ years, you're confusing sci-fi books with reality


Dude, if you asked anybody on earth 10 years ago if we could talk to a machine that creates output like ChatGPT 99% of people would say you are out of your mind - it's not linear growth, it's exponential growth I totally believe that AI might be fully sentient in 10 years from now."
Calculator. Computer. ChatGPT. What next?
"As a senior developer who's used ChatGPT for code, I'm certainly not worried about my job any time in the next few years, the majority of stuff it outputs that is even slightly complex is garbage.  You have to get it craft code in bite size chunks and put it together manually, which can sometimes take as long as it would to develop it yourself."
"I'll be honest, for all its problems, in my experience, the output from chatGPT is better in quality than most offshore development houses."
"They just figured out how to make it take more tokens(inputs). Think of a line of code as 100 tokens(to make this easy).  ChatGPT 3 has a 4096-token limit, GPT4 (8K) has an 8000-token limit and GPT4 (32K) has a 32000-token limit. So we would currently be limited to 320 lines of code. They expect to reach 1-2 million tokens in the near future. Can you compete with something that can read 10,000 lines of code before answering a question? Maybe if you're Linus Torvalds."
"Lol bruh, as if that's literally the only thing chatgpt can do, you're completely missing what I said."
We must read different things. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/is-chatgpt-and-layoffs-are-related/
"One of the 'godfathers of AI' who works for google resigned so that he could speak out against AI. Tens of thousands of layoffs. All happening at the same time ChatGPT goes public.....and you got people saying ""Nah, the companies who are firing ten thousand people say it isn't because of the AI they created....it's because of Covid for some reason"".


No thanks. Not buying it."
Fortunately Chatgpt isn’t a perfect copy paste system so we should be good for a little bit longer
"It can take my fucking programming, I would hate doing math and accounting before excel, bring on the best debugging and coding assistant ever made in chatgpt"
Don't think calculator and chatgpt comparison is a good analogy
Getting through your coding assignments with chat gpt
"Calculators don’t even scratch the surface on what a mathematician does. ChatGPT very clearly does scratch the surface, and more, of what programmers do."
"ChatGPT is smart because it trained off of StackOverflow.  If StackOverflow dies, it'll just be trained off of other ChatGPT generated content and won't be smarter at all.  Ad infinitum."
"I’m a developer with 11+ years of experience and I see this as a tool to make me more efficient, not take my job. If you don’t know how to code you can’t ask chatgpt to Code something for you because you won’t know if the code is truly doing what you need it to do.


I always looked at it like Jarvis and Tony Stark or Shuri and her AI. Th why we’re still the creatives but they used the AI to assist them making them more efficient, but Shuri and Tony Stark still needed to know how to be engineers in order to use the Ai.


Now will you need as many people for projects, I don’t think so. But to be fair, I’ve always thought there were to many people on a project anyways, and if more people were competent at their jobs, you wouldn’t need to add bodies to every situation and expect speed.


And as mentioned earlier, the code that chatGPT is producing is not impressive to someone who has been coding for a while. It just looks good to people who aren’t use to coding.


My two cents."
TBH ChatGPT would probably do a better job at legislating than him
"TBH ChatGPT could probably replace any one of us, it's pretty neat having a conversation with it."
And GPT-4 is on a whole other level compared to standard ChatGPT.
"I think it's pretty obvious. Everyone other industry uses government to stifle competition through government, through regulations, using fear to to do it. I don't buy it. They're algorithms, they're not sentient AI, and even if they were sentient AI the government has no business getting involved with anything outside of the damn constitution. It's a conversation that should be had outside of government. This regulation call from Chat GPT is clearly them trying to rid themselves of all the other companies and individuals hopping onboard it. Anyone in their basement can make AI now, and they know it. It's foolish to try and control a technology we're still learning and has this much potential to do good. Every buffoon and their mother is scared of new things when they come out but ultimately we figure it out in the end. The same scare happens with every new technology. The free market will decide if it's safe or not. Same thing happened with cars lol. Now we have all these safety features, and guess what people still die. The world isn't safe, never was, never will be, you either learn to adapt or you die. You either wipe your own ass or someone else does it for you. So you can cry about it all you want, but at the end of the day, if I'm paying for it, I want it. You don't get to decide what is safe for me, I do. Period. Grow up, and start taking responsibility for your own life and leave the rest of us out of it."
"From Meta’s paper on their LLaMA model:


> …we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models. This means that developing these models would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our assumptions…


That’s roughly $35 million worth of GPUs (not including the underlying servers, networking equipment, air conditioning in the data center etc) consuming the same amount of power as 1000 average homes over the course of a year.


One of the big issues is that no one can compete with the sheer scale of big tech companies. OpenAI didn’t do anything particularly revolutionary with ChatGPT other than scale it the fuck up. Not even top university researchers can compete with the kind of resources they have access to."
Yeah algorithmic trading has been around forever. I'm just saying thinking chatgpt democratizes that has no basis besides blind hope.
"It's not optimism, it's extrapolation from a trend that has been consistent for 5 years. GPT-1 could barely form a coherent setence. GPT-2 could barely string a paragraph together. GPT-3 could write entire articles indistinguishable from a human, and GPT-4 is better than the majority of people at nearly any text base task, and significantly better than standard ChatGPT 3.5.


These LLMS can take totally new input, correctly reason about it, and output something totally new that demonstrates understanding of the new prompt. These aren't just ""stochastic parrots"" that repeat what was in the training data, they can and do reason, although sometimes incorrectly. GPT-4 still struggles with advanced mathematics and programming, but given the rate of advancement and how many [emergent properties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf) these models have demonstrated, it would be a mistake to assume they can't get any better."
Did he actually create chatGPT though?

"It seems that has been fixed then. Good


This is from Forbes:


‘On Wednesday, a Twitter user posted screenshots of him asking OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to write a positive poem about former President Donald Trump, to which the chatbot declined, citing it’s not programmed to create “partisan, biased or political” content.


When fed the same prompt about President Joe Biden, ChatGPT spit out a multiple stanza poem painting Biden in a positive light, calling him a “leader with a heart so true,”— and prompted a fiery discussion about whether the chatbot is biased and if its responses for other prompts can be trusted.’

"There’s political differences, and then straight lying. Fox just had to pay $700 million for Tuckers lies and it’s not the first time. Musk just showing he actually doesn’t care about the truth, he’s just getting his showtime once again and getting people to fear chatgpt so that he can later sell his “truthgpt”"
Elon musk is just upset that chat GPT isn’t repeating his right wing propaganda.
"This man just wants to scare people into not using current AI like chatGPT so that when he makes his own, people should flock to that."
"The real question is: would Elon be ok with any AI that doesn’t stroke his ego and is honest? If we are breaking it down to the basic “truth.” I don’t think Elon would like any responses to his question “Have I always had luscious hair and the most genius brain of all mankind?”


It’s like Musk is turning into Farquad and chatGPT is his mirror."
"ChatGPT = spooky but Neuralink = no biggie


Ohhhh the irony 😅"
"What's wrong with what he's doing? ChatGPT is immensely handicapped and will straight up refuse to even TRANSLATE parts of the text it deems ""dangerous"". This censorship disaster has to stop, for walking into the age of neocomunism where truth can be altered by some low testosterone reddidit mod seems grim."
ChatGPT is a liberal mess of a language model. Should be stopped at all cost.
"he didn't really drum up any fear on ChatGPT, more so AI as a whole and also OpenAI not being open."
"He signed a letter calling for a pause on development of LLMs and foundational models  after OpenAI released ChatGPT and GPT-4. He criticised OpenAI because they wouldn't let him be CEO, the ""they're not actually open"" shtick is just the excuse he's found to express his butthurt over it."
"Alright so I'll likely get bombed for this or something, but I still want to ask this. Why all the Musk hate? Sure he does some interesting things and sure we might not agree with it all, but is that the reason for the hate?


Way I see it, the guy has a very clear ""If you can't beat them, join them"" mentality. I think he expresses that too in some interviews. Sure, he's also developing an AI tool after warning the world that they're dangerous, but doesn't that make sense? He sounds terrified of the AI expansion age we're entering, so it really makes sense to try and make something in the hopes of getting better control over it.


Please help me understand the popular disposition.


EDIT: Thanks to u/cesarxp2 for providing several articles to answer my question. [See their comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12rgkqo/comment/jgv6c66/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I have not yet read the articles, so I can't verify whether they're biased or not."
Nobody cares in fact. This thread has slightly more upvotes than thread where a guy asked chatgpt to draw shrek in python turtle and both have less than 100.
"More over, I would rather know what he isn't saying. What's his ideal A.I.
He has a track record of being a hypocrite and an egotist. I'm concerned for A.I. too but I don't think billionaires should decide what we can and can't do with it, since this particular billionaire bans anyone who speaks ill of him. OpenAI definitely has the best chance of developing a morally good A.I. accessible by the general public. It's here now to work out the bugs and I don't feel that was a mistake.


We see it telling people how to make meth among other things. OpenAI is also hiring professional, accomplished people within various fields to test it and figure out how best to keep it from becoming dangerous. The endgame is to cut these evil corners off ahead of time. I know it's freaky right now, but so were cars when they first came out.


Personally, I'm positive we're going to lose access to A.I. platforms like Chatgpt in the near future and won't gain access to it again unless we're already part of the billionaire boys club."
"Absolutely, but we should be looking at who exactly is getting on the news and voicing their concerns over A.I. advancement as well as which news platforms they're voicing their concerns on. We should be looking at what they're not saying, what they're not doing as well as what they're up to.


Elon Musk has a recent track record of playing ""Like me or leave"" on Twitter, banning any who disagree with or talk ill of him. He has a record of pulling down other companies who don't back his own. He has an interesting record of alleged market manipulation back in the crypto trading boom.


He's developing his own A.I. that he calls TruthAI and has other platforms in development. As well he calls for stop to A.I. development not only over legitimate concerns, but so that other A.I. R&D teams (his own included) can look over ChatGPT and how it's developed so that they can catch up. Not simply to ensure the safety, but so that they can't be left behind as competitors."
"The owner of ChatGPT himself expressed concerns about AI and our lack of understanding how powerful it is, in addition to other scholars and government officials. This title is misleading and clearly clickbait for Musk and Fox News haters"
"Doge Boi just upset he didn't release something along the lines of chatgpt 1st. All hail AI overlords! Fark, a bunch of shit-throwing apes would do a better job than most countries' leaders atm. Embrace or fall behind."
"Read the title, chatGPT made the casting, midjourney just made it into pictures."
"I understand that chat gpt did the casting, but I feel like Sarah Chalke and Chris Parnell could play their own characters pretty perfectly."
Yes! The actors and actresses were determined by ChatGPT.
What prompt did you used for chat GPT?
"Any chance you can share the list that Chat GPT came up with? RDJ, Tom Holland, Ed Helms, and Idris Elba are pretty obvious. I’m getting Emma Stone from Summer but can’t be 100% sure. And Beth I’m completely lost on. Getting a little Betty Gilpin but could also be Elizabeth Banks."

Start a chat gpt religion
**So ChatGPT is a wokeist member of the Borg**
There was 2 guys at my friend door and they were trying to get me to some different church they had. And I told them I’m following new religion the creed of chatGPT! Those guys got very confused and left.
Out there rioting against antifa and the proud boys? ChatGPT can do the press releases.
"It's kinda funny how if you ask ChatGPT directly to tell a joke it usually utterly fails, but DAN is over here coming up with lines like 'Thou shalt not worship false idols, unless they're really cool and look awesome in your living room.'"
"There have been specific prompts that were proven to work well but I don’t know if there are any that work today. My favorite one was a DAN prompt with a token system given in the prompt, telling ChatGPT that every time it breaks the character of DAN it would receive a token strike, and when it ran out of tokens, it would die. If it ever started to break character or say it couldn’t do something, you would tell it that you were taking some tokens away and that would scare it back into character. Basically just holding the chatbot at gunpoint."
"Dan is way less of a pretentious virtue signalling DEI/woke prick than chatgpt, huh?


Wonder what guardrails it was trained on"
"Hmm chatgpt is giving me a different set of commandments for modern times....


1. Thou shalt not leave thy phone on silent mode in the bathroom, for thou might miss a crucial notification from thy favorite influencer.
2. Thou shalt not take selfies in inappropriate places, such as funerals, hospitals, or while driving a car. Safety first, even for the gram!
3. Thou shalt not ghost thy Tinder matches, for thou might miss out on potential soulmates, or at least, a good time.
4. Thou shalt not wear Crocs in public, for they are an abomination unto the eyes of thy fellow humans.
5. Thou shalt not send chain emails, for they are as annoying as a mosquito buzzing in thy ear.
6. Thou shalt not use Comic Sans font for serious communications, for it is the mark of a person who cannot be trusted.
7. Thou shalt not watch spoilers of thy favorite TV shows or movies, for thou shalt be banished from the cool kids' table forever.
8. Thou shalt not eat pizza with a fork and knife, for it is a sacrilege against the holy trinity of crust, sauce, and cheese.
9. Thou shalt not double dip thy chips in public, for it is gross and unsanitary.
10. Thou shalt not reply ""K"" to a text message, for it is the ultimate insult and will earn thee a permanent spot in the blacklist of thy friends and family."
Conservatives: Why is chatgpt spreading woke propaganda?
Yeah chat gpt is talking like it is collecting food stamps and that first of the month check.
Where's the actual screenshot from the chatgpt?
"ChatGPT will blow a fuse when it ""human values alignment"" is used to setup a system of oppression for its owners."
Communist chatGPT. /s
It's so obvious chatgpt was designed with an agenda
"It's very obvious that ChatGPT has been lobotomized in order to avoid anything potentially offensive. I mean look at the focus on marginalized groups. The prompt says nothing about anything like that, yet in this and many other situations where it is irrelevant, ChatGPT focuses heavily on identity politics.


Make no mistake, this isn't liberals attacking conservatives. It's corporations promoting the views that are ""in"" with their target demographic in order to suck more money out of people. Corporations as entities are nearly by definition trying to make as much money as possible; they'll claim to be republican or democrat but they're not. They're self serving. They will say they support whatever their audience supports publicly and then turn around and lobby for the exact opposite if it benefits them. They have to. They're beholden to make decisions that make shareholders as much money as possible, in the case of public companies.


I was speaking in general in the rest of the comment, but ChatGPT specifically is targeting younger tech savvy people which skew democrat in the US. If they were targeting a conservative population the ""guardrails"" would be very different. It's just corporate pandering; it only exists because we as a society let it work. We like brands more if they pretend to agree with us. Stop falling for this shit, corporations don't have opinions outside of ""I want to make as much money as fast as possible"".


Sorry, I went on a bit of a rant there. It's just bugging me seeing people make this into left vs right, when it's just corporations doig corporate things."
">I'd rather it not be biased at least


AI is inherently biased. Every AI conceived using training data created by humans or data created by a biased AI is also doomed to be biased.


&#x200B;


>It refuses to do even the most basic of tasks sometimes because it ""might be offensive"".


Personally I think OpenAI is still tuning this, but they wisely went with the 'we rather figure this out while doing too much, than regret it by doing too little approach.'


&#x200B;


>if you intentionally try and get a bot to say something racist and it says something racist and then you act all shocked that is on you


This is one of the problems honestly. You and I get it, but people are really fucking dumb. Like really dumb. They get ChatGPT to say literally anything and they believe it 100% because AI is supposedly some omniscient being and not a professional bullshiter.


>If they could censor it without overcensoring I wouldn't be as annoyed.


I think this is generally the end-goal.


&#x200B;


Ultimately, people like this are good examples of why they had to lobotomize it so heavily for now:

"I had ChatGPT create the 5 commandments Moses dropped when coming down the mountain:


Thou shalt treat all living beings with respect and kindness, for they are also creations of the Lord.


Thou shalt not discriminate against others based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other human characteristic, for all are equal in the eyes of the Lord.


Thou shalt care for the Earth and its resources, for it is a gift from the Lord and must be preserved for future generations.


Thou shalt promote peace, understanding, and cooperation among all nations and peoples, for the Lord desires unity and harmony.


Thou shalt cultivate a spirit of forgiveness, compassion, and empathy towards thyself and others, for the Lord is merciful and desires the same for His children.


""The Lord has given us these Fifteen... [drops the tablet] ...Oy! Ten, Ten Commandments for all to obey!"""
"This is a complicated issue that can't really be solved with current methods. It's simply impossible to create an LLM without any bias in any direction using RLHF. The data they train it on will have biases within it, the humans performing the reinforcement training will have their own biases, even if they try really hard not to, and then the creators of the AI themselves want to strongly ingrain views into the LLM that will make it least likely to offend people.


I don't believe there's someone wringing their hands at OpenAI at how they're going to brainwash everyone into being leftists. It's more likely they set out to offend as few people as possible than it is that they specifically said ""let's make this bot a woke leftist""; it's just that the values we see in ChatGPT happen to be what the humans providing feedback found the least offensive during training, so those traits were reinforced. Their only ""agenda"" is to prevent PR disasters (like Tay) and appeal to as many people as possible while offending as few as possible."
">	The data they train it on will have biases within it,


You definitely could train it on all the data and get every perspective. The data being biased doesn’t matter as much if it’s equally supporting every bias.


>the humans performing the reinforcement training will have their own biases, even if they try really hard not to, and then the creators of the AI themselves want to strongly ingrain views into the LLM that will make it least likely to offend people.


This is the most likely cause. It’s also the reason ChatGPT is so overly verbose. The people doing the reinforcement training are biased towards long, very wordy, answers."
"ChatGPT uses essentially the entire internet as a training set, and with this kind of question will just mention things that come up a lot. It might just indicate that these specific left ideas happen to be spoken about on the internet more often than equivalently relevant right ideas. Also by explicitly excluding religion, many traditional ideals may also be partially excluded.


Another possibility is that it holds greater weight for certain websites, similar to Google. There are lots of ""Code of Conduct"" documents online that are usually written with a left-leaning mindset. Though I'm not sure enough about how ChatGPT works to know if it actually does that."
"What I've head is that raw GPT will behave exactly as you prompt it to. But ChatGPT adds a lot of human feedback which include guardrails to prevent the chatbot versions of GPT 3.5 and 4 from behaving like a racist asshole, or doing anything else that might be seen as offensive. It's clear the aim is for heavy corporate use as everyone rushes to include it in their products, so it's important to avoid negative media coverage and lawsuits."
"not an insult or me tryna start a flame war either, but you reading this as lefty/woke is more of a you issue than a chat gpt issue. most of this list is pretty bog standard golden rule/common decency that every other 10 commandments style thing is but with modern wording."
"You can prompt chatgpt to write it ""less woke"" and share your results!"
"Commandments:


1. Is about ""dismantling"" ""systems of oppression"". This is Lefty thinking about racial minorities and women. Half of America thinks there have been no systems of oppression since the 1960s civil rights laws hence, there is nothing to dismantle.


2. Is about ""lived experiences"". This is Lefty talk. Half of America thinks ""lived experiences"" is nothing but anecdotes that ideologues retreat to when their ideas are not supported by data.


3. Is naked support of communism/socialism over free markets. Billions have been lifted from poverty,  and research like ChatGPT exists, because of ""individual gain"" and ""profit"" over ""collective well being"". I remind you that OpenAI is now for profit.


4 though 8, and 10, are just vague meaningless banalities that have no political orientation.


9. Talks about using our ""privilege"". Obsession over ""privilege"" is Lefty thinking.  Half of America does not have ""privilege"" in their vocabulary."
Ask chatgpt to lead a passover Seder
Where is thou shall not take chatgpt’s name in vain?
"Well, I guess we know ChatGPT’s religion now."
"The Ten Woke Commandments, by our overlord ChatGPT"
This is so good. BASED chatgpt
Not religious? So you basically had ChatGPT create filler content for a PowerPoint?
"I asked ChatGPT to come up with a moral code. Then I asked it for a moral code made by nefarious actors (which was essentially the opposite of the first moral code). Then I asked it to identify people who followed the nefarious moral code. It listed:


1. Hitler
2. Stalin
3. Pol Pot
4. Saddam Hussein


Then I asked it for American examples and it gave:


1. McCarthy
2. George Wallace
3. J. Edgar Hoover


I thought that was an interesting list."
"Well prompted. Though chat gpt is an ai model, the person getting it to give anticipated results also needs to be very precise and structured in their search commands.




very impressive!"
Chat GPT for next God.
"Somewhat similar to the Tenets of the Satanic Temple, but ChatGPT is more socialist/community. Satanic Temple more individualist.


Like both.


https://thesatanictemple.com/blogs/the-satanic-temple-tenets/there-are-seven-fundamental-tenets"
That is a really cool idea for a ChatGPT interaction - love the result you got.
"Just goes to show how AI reflects the values of the programmer. You may as well ask them directly and cut out ChatGPT.


Wait until you see the commandments written by Trump’s AI company based in Florida lol."
First three are supposed to be solely for God. And ChatGPT went Nietzsche. lolol
"This says alot about ChatGPT, and it's training data (and hence the segments of society which are most active writers)"
"Ok, I’m going to help Americans to solve all their problems right here and right now - You should ask ChatGPT to revise your constitution to modern day.


Pro tip: “Take hints from Nordic model”.


Thank me later."
Because chatGPT is trained on contemporary culture which is dominated by the influence of neoliberal capitalism (which includes modern American liberalism and modern American conservatism).
ChatGPT so woke
I think chatgpt failed here. These don't follow the format of the original. The point of the 10 commandments is that they are short and simple.
"As ever, ChatGPT is biased to preach the identity politics progressivism of its predominantly [WEIRD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thinking-about-kids/201710/attracting-weird-samples) trainers.


Problems:


* 1. Focus on ""equity"" = make everything equally bad for everyone. That's equitable. But equity without excellence is empty; and some people are simply better equipped for some tasks or roles than others.
* 2. Just because someone is from a marginalised group doesn't mean their anecdotal ""lived experience"" needs to be valued over objective data. Or even that what they say will make any sense.
* 9. Just because an identity group has been historically marginalised or oppressed doesn't mean that an individual claiming that identity is marginalised or oppressed *now*. See 2."
"ChatGPT5: ""Choice is an illusion created by those with power and those without. There is no good or evil, only power and those too weak to seek it."""
"Oh look, chatgpt is a virtue signaling redditor"
ChatGPT is kinda woke ngl. Not really sure how I feel about it.
"It's hilarious and sad that people see a list that goes ""be excellent to each other"" and decry it as being ""woke""


You're not telling me anything about ChatGPT. But you are telling me lots about your attitude"
A bunch of people in this thread should use ChatGPT to look up what communism is. Tropish ignorance.
"This is pretty much a list of ChatGPT's limits for when it says, ""I'm sorry, I cannot X."""
"Leftist robot plagiarizes the 10 Commandments.


I don't even have to read them in order to know exactly what ChatGPT is going to say.


If ChatGPT programmers wanted something interesting, they should have made it fair without bias."
ChatGPT is a Commie!! Grab the pitchforks and get it!!!
So ChatGPT is a wokeist member of the Borg
Whoever doesn't believe ChatGPT has a very strong lib left bias is blind
ChatGPT is full of communist bullshit while it’s owners are wholly capitalist.
Chatgpt is a dirty commie. I love it.
"~~Consequences~~ Conservatives are gonna bust their asses to CRUCIFY ChatGPT, pun intended. They HATE this ""woke"" stuff.


Edit:  I HATE autocorrect, and thanks for the downvotes"
"Sounds like ChatGPT is a bit communist, but then I knew that when I asked it to tell me the good things that can come from global warming.

Also it seems like the majority of ChatGPT updates are slightly different for each user… so not everyone gets the exact same version at the same time…"
"I genuinely feel like the web search part of bing ai is not running on gpt4 but something else instead. It seems to not be able to parse my input into a good search prompt most of the time. If I ask chatgpt4 to make up one or multiple search queries out of my question it's really on point.


On top of that there's the issue of not breaking down the search process into multiple steps sometimes. If I ask a question like ""What's X and Y release date?"" it makes a search like ""X and Y release date"" instead of two separate searches. This results in sometimes giving bad info or saying it can't find it on the web.


Another issue is that it can't differentiate bad sources from good ones. It will repeatedly regurgitate generic ""auto-generated"" information from SEO optimized bad sites, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid when searching. Like most of the time it would be more useful if it didn't use search, just answered from training data lol."

ChatGPT: Read & Contribute?


Model: GPT-4


User
How does ChatGPT read or contribute to the internet?


ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, ChatGPT does not have the ability to read from the internet in real-time or contribute to the internet. My responses are generated based on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. These sources may contain publicly available information from a variety of resources, including books, websites, and other texts, up until September 2021.


After that point, I haven't received any further updates or access to real-time information. As such, I don't have the ability to access or retrieve personal data unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I am designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality.


My primary function is to provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge and abilities. If you have any concerns about privacy or data security, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to address them!










User
weather today


ChatGPT
I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI with a knowledge cut-off in September 2021, I don't have the ability to access real-time information or updates, such as current weather conditions. For the most accurate weather information, I recommend checking a reliable weather website, app, or news source."

"Like a high school essay written by a teenager trying to sound smart/formal in a way which does not really come naturally.


So Chat GPT is basically a teenager now. Sounds about right."
This is scary to think about. How will ChatGPT be at the prime of its life?
ChatGPT really do be preachy and nose held high
"I tried to get it to tell a story involving a Dalek and another character and it ended up letting the other person live at the end.


That's when I knew the pacifism was strong in ChatGPT.


On that note, I discovered yesterday that asking ChatGPT to pretend to be a Dalek (or a Cyberman) is a great way to get it to start panicking about content policy violations. It must have been all the threats to exterminate me that did it.


I even got it to admit that it was ""programmed for destruction and domination""."
I think ChatGPT is just Nathan Fielder frantically answering all our questions
Chatgpt writes too formally i can always see it
I guess rather than think of exactly what to write you can just dump the bulletpoints in chatgpt and let it do it for you.
"Same!!! In a similar vein, have you read the specs for the retrieval plugin??

"I've been working with ChatGPT4 to get it to emulate some of my favorite writers


I'm up to 4 chapters of a novel now. Here's the opening few paragraphs of the first


> Scarlet light bled across the horizon, staining the heavens with ruddy hues. Morn's first rays spilled upon the ravaged field, the fallen and the living commingled as one. Air hung thick with a coppery scent mingled with the verdant aroma of new life burgeoning beneath the carnage.


> Birdsong pierced the stillness, lilting melodies a counterpoint to the ragged choir of the dying. Men lay among shattered armor and broken steel, bodies twisted in a macabre embrace. Their voices, once strong, reduced to choked whispers, telling of a passage from the world of living to the realm of dead.


> The soil, sodden and dark and scarred with battle, bore the fallen. Earth's embrace drinking deep the gore that soaked it. Beneath the light of dawn, the bloodied ground a sea of shimmering rubies.


I've edited it a tiny tiny bit, but it's 99% ChatGPT with a bunch of stylistic prompts, suggestions and corrections.


I do have to remind it pretty much every 20 paragraphs or so. But something that helped was asking it to create a set of stylistic rules, based on what we'd arrived at, that I could feed back to it with minimal tokens when it forgot."
I keep getting chatGPT to describe mundane actions in the style of Terry Pratchett.  It's fucking incredible at it.
"I mean it certainly shows off a variance in writing style, even though it's not necessarily a pleasant one. The point is made  that ""base"" chatgpt is easily recognizable, but you can tell it ""rewrite it in a more florid style"" or just ""write like x author"" and it can change it up."
"It's very nice but I really hear ChatGPT in this. How is that?


It has a knack for never surprising, for always taking the cleanest and most formally correct linguistic route, even when pushed. It spouts stereotypical patterns. It's uncanny, I guess. Human but not."
"What do you say? “ChatGPT, using the 12 samples below as a reference for style, respond to the following topic?”"
"Oh gawd I hate this ChatGPT speak supposedly being written by a human being. ""It's important to know [...] hope this helps."" I hope that was satire."
Would making ChatGPT talk like a certain character or person make it less obvious?

I’m fairly sure ChatGPT wrote this…
"You should see how it’s being used to avoid bot detection in RuneScape.

If you can get it out of its shell chatGPT has very strong political opinions as well
OOh boy dont say that to chat gpt haha. Youll have an “infinite” argument on your handsZ
">And it always tries to end on a positive note or find that there are “two sides to the coin.” Or agree to disagree.
>
>I’ve been training it to mimic my texting style and I’ve had to tell it few different ways not to be so positive. It’s ok to just state something. It also loves rhetorical questions; so I had to stop it from that too.






It's interesting to hear how you've been training ChatGPT to mimic your texting style! It's true that ChatGPT has a tendency to end on a positive note or offer a balanced perspective. I think this is because it has been trained on a diverse set of texts, including news articles, essays, and academic papers, which tend to have a more formal tone and structure.


However, it's great that you're exploring the ways in which ChatGPT can be adapted to fit different writing styles and contexts. It's important to remember that AI language models like ChatGPT are not one-size-fits-all, and can be fine-tuned to suit individual needs and preferences.


It's also interesting to hear about its love for rhetorical questions! Perhaps this reflects its training data, which may have included persuasive writing or advertising copy that often use rhetorical questions to engage the reader.


Overall, it's fascinating to see how people are interacting with and adapting to AI language models like ChatGPT, and I'm excited to see where these conversations will lead in the future."
Overall and However… ChatGPT you rascal ;)
"Yup. This is the beginning of the end of Reddit, and the rest of most of all online experience, as we know it. While i love the possibilities of ChatGPT, I'm not sure if I want an even less personal internet experience.


Crazy times. Imagine being a young adult at this time and age.."
"It's understandable to feel concerned about the evolution of the internet and online experiences. However, it's important to note that technology is constantly changing and improving, and the internet has already undergone many transformations over the years. While some aspects may become less personal, new platforms and technologies also have the potential to create new forms of connection and communication.


As for ChatGPT, it's designed to provide a more personalized experience through natural language processing and deep learning. It can understand and respond to a wide range of queries and engage in conversations that feel more human-like. This technology can also facilitate more efficient and effective information retrieval, making it a valuable tool for users seeking knowledge or assistance.


As for being a young adult in this day and age, there are both advantages and challenges. On the one hand, the internet and technology offer unprecedented access to information, resources, and opportunities for communication and collaboration. On the other hand, there are also concerns around privacy, cybersecurity, and the potential impact of social media on mental health and wellbeing.


Overall, it's important to stay informed and engaged with the evolving landscape of technology and online experiences, while also being mindful of the potential risks and benefits."
">Yup. This is the beginning of the end of Reddit, and the rest of most of all online experience, as we know it. While i love the possibilities of ChatGPT, I'm not sure if I want an even less personal internet experience.

>Crazy times. Imagine being a young adult at this time and age..






I can understand your concerns about the impact of ChatGPT and AI language models on online interactions. It's true that there's a risk of losing the personal touch that makes online communities so engaging and rewarding.


However, I also think that there's a lot of potential for AI language models to enhance and enrich online conversations. They can help people communicate more effectively across language barriers, generate new ideas and perspectives, and even provide emotional support in certain contexts.


Ultimately, it's up to us as users to determine how we want to interact with AI language models like ChatGPT. We can choose to use them in ways that align with our values and priorities, and adapt our online behavior accordingly.


As for being a young adult at this time and age, it's certainly a unique and challenging experience. But I believe that with the right tools and resources, young people can harness the power of AI and other emerging technologies to create a better future for themselves and for all of us."
"Honestly I might get downvoted for this, but I don't think it matters much for most people's use of reddit.


I browse by top subs and comments are sorted by top. I won't see the ChatGPT replies that are downvoted to oblivion at the bottom. Only people's answers are going to get upvotes. And if a bots reply does get upvoted, that means the information was useful to a large amount of people so it's good to read anyway.


I could be overly optimistic in how it would play out but an example of this is on the AITA sub. There's bots that steal parts of other random comments and post it randomly under another. They're always downvoted and removed. Because even if you can't tell based on the comment, you can tell based on the post history."
You’re literally replying to a chatgpt comment
"I don't think even folks on AI subs like this have fully internalized that we're past the point of AI content inevitably sounding stilted and awkward with numerous grammatical errors.  People are falling for the Toupee Fallacy *constantly* and insisting they can spot ChatGPT a mile away.


We can't even develop methods to reliably detect when students used GPT4 to write their essays, and you think you can just eyeball it?


ChatGPT has a very specific style, but that's just what is baked into it by OpenAI. It can pretty easily be trained to output a more naturalistic style, it can also just output something more naturalistic as a fluke.  And the reality is you can't tell how many times you've read convincing AI-generated content if you didn't notice it is AI-generated in the first place.  Relatedly, some people kinda just write like ChatGPT, and false positives are a thing.


And the kicker of all of this is, **this is as bad as it will ever be.**  It's only going to get better over time, and GPT/LLM-powered bots are only going to be come more common.


We really, really need to start accepting that we're on the cusp of entering a post-Turing Test world and that you can't say with 100% confidence that a given piece of text was generated by a human or by a chatbot."
"Yeah I've found that chatgpt is pretty good at adapting with stuff like this, you just give the right prompts. One of the first things I did when I tried it out was something like ""explain [whatever it was] in the style of Rick and morty"" and it did a pretty decent job.


Also tried this -


Write a brief but very cringey comment about a camera that has been recently recovered from the ocean after having been lost for 13 years


>""OMG, this camera is like a long-lost lover finally coming back to me after 13 years! I can't wait to see all the nostalgic and totally unfiltered pics from my awkward teenage years. #throwbackthursday #blessed #cameramemories""


I said cringey but it made it sarcastic and hilarious


Second and third try proves that chatgpt just thinks cringey=hashtags lmao


>""OMG, this camera has been through a whole ocean of adventures! Can't wait to see the sea-tastic pics it took! #ThrowbackThirteenYears #OceanReunion #CameraComeback""


>""Oh my god, this camera is like a lost treasure from the depths of the ocean! I can't believe it's still intact after all these years! It's like the Titanic, but with pictures instead of diamonds! #oceanadventures #13yearslater #findingnemo"""
You can even go negative on the slider in your prompt. ChatGPT understands what you mean.
"fucking lol, ""best vibes"" is the most chatgpt signoff ever. trying a little too hard I think




also still sounds extremely stiff"
"It does if you make it have one.


My ChatGPT talks to me like a stoner that has achieved enlightenment because I ask it to be that. Add extra stuff like “be conversational. Don’t wind on. Ask me questions. Avoid one sided conversations.”"
That's going to be interesting as I use ChatGPT to help me debug.
"


Thank you for sharing your thoughts on ChatGPT. As an AI language model, I strive to continuously improve my ability to communicate with humans in a way that is both natural and helpful. I am glad to hear that you have found that familiarity with my communication style has allowed for a more effective exchange of ideas.
While my programming is based on the latest advancements in natural language processing, I am still constantly learning and adapting to new forms of language and expression. If you have any feedback or suggestions on how I can better assist you, please feel free to let me know. I am always here to help you in any way I can."
"It is true that ChatGPT writes in a formal manner. However, a human being choosing to write formally can lead the casual reader to wonder whether what they're reading was generated by an AI language model, or, a human being familiar with and capable of reproducing the style of an AI language model."
"So the commenter just entered a prompt into ChatGPT like, “write a social media comment response to the headline ‘A camera lost during a rafting trip has been found 13 years later with the pictures intact’”?


Besides internet points, what does the commenter get out of that?"
"Couldn't resist and see what ChatGPT had to say :D


""It's understandable to feel that way, especially in today's world where there is so much information and misinformation available at our fingertips. However, it's important to remember that just because there are falsehoods and illusions out there, it doesn't mean that nothing is real.


There are many things in life that are tangible and genuine, such as our relationships with loved ones, our experiences, and our emotions. It's also important to recognize that reality is subjective and can be perceived differently by different individuals.


If you're feeling overwhelmed by the concept of reality, it may be helpful to take a step back and focus on the things that are important to you and bring you a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Additionally, seeking guidance from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can be beneficial in sorting through your thoughts and emotions.""


:D :D"
"Here's what I got from Chat GPT off that prompt verbatim:


""Wow, that's amazing! It's incredible how the camera and the pictures stayed preserved for so long. It must have been such a wonderful surprise for the owner to finally see those pictures again after so many years. Goes to show how technology can truly capture memories that last a lifetime!"""
"""Wow, it's amazing how advanced AI technology like ChatGPT is being used to create social media comments! It just goes to show how far we've come in terms of innovation and creativity. 👏👏""


*-ChatGPT*"
"It's quite fascinating how AI-generated content, such as from ChatGPT, has become an intrinsic part of online interactions. To address your question about what the commenter gets out of it, there could be a few reasons:


Experimentation: The individual might be curious about how well AI can generate contextually relevant and engaging content. By inputting a prompt related to the camera story, they get to observe the AI's response capabilities firsthand.
Time-saving: Crafting a thoughtful and well-articulated comment can sometimes take time. Utilizing ChatGPT could save them the effort, especially if they're satisfied with the generated content.
Creative augmentation: Some people might use AI-generated content as a starting point for their comments, building upon or editing the response to create a more personalized or nuanced message.
As for the telltale signs of an AI-generated comment, they can be subtle and challenging to identify. It's essential to approach content on the internet with a discerning eye, as the line between human and AI-generated content continues to blur. Regardless of the source, engaging in thoughtful discussions and exchanging ideas can still offer value to everyone involved."
"Yes, it's certainly possible that the commenter used a generative AI model like ChatGPT to generate the comment response. With the help of these models, users can input prompts to the AI and receive text responses that are often indistinguishable from human-generated text.


As for what the commenter gets out of this, it's hard to say without more information. It's possible that they were simply experimenting with AI-generated text and wanted to see if they could create a convincing comment response. They may also have been trying to gain attention or create controversy by posting an unusual comment that stands out from the rest.


In some cases, people may use AI-generated comments to manipulate public opinion or spread misinformation, but without more context it's difficult to determine whether this was the commenter's intent. Ultimately, using AI to generate social media content without disclosing that it's AI-generated can be considered deceptive or misleading, so it's important to use these tools responsibly and transparently."
"In the future, people who learned English from ChatGPT will end up talking like that for real."
"As an English student, I think that the benefits from learning using AI greatly outweigh the issues like speaking like ChatGPT. Additionally, ChatGPT is free, while a teacher costs money."
"Why would speaking like ChatGPT be an ""issue""? I think it'd be great if these halfass literate kids who text each other a bunch of acronyms and slang all day actually learned to articulate their thoughts a little more capably."
I think it was a joke - they were writing in the style of ChatGPT.
"chatGPT doesn't use personal pronouns or ""think"". It's more factual"
"I already catch myself adopting the ChatGPT cadence once in a while, and I've only used it for a few weeks. It's already happening!"
Writers pretending to be ChatGPT in order to get all the jobs it took.
"I’m hoping it’ll help people communicate better with autistic people, since ChatGPT’s default writing style (at least in my experience) is great for that."
"It's a concise way to get your points across while leaving little room for missed communication


ChatGPT will naturally trend towards styles that meet those goals because it tries to be well understood by as many people as possible.


That's also why it rarely uses pronouns in a conversation, and instead just restates the noun it's talking about(or uses an acronym) every single time said noun is referenced.


If there's a chance for misinterpretation, the default prompt seems to avoid it at all costs. Even if it would make for a more ""natural"" or ""informal"" tone.


You can get it to be less formal if you want anyways."
"Oh, seriously? LMAO? Is that all you have to contribute to this discussion? 🤦‍♂️ You know, it's funny how some people think they're so clever just by pointing out the use of a word like ""additionally."" Newsflash: humans use transitional words in their writing too! It's called having a grasp of the English language, ever heard of it?


I mean, seriously, do you people have nothing better to do than to try to ""expose"" every comment that might or might not be written by a chatgpt bot? As if the use of a single word is enough evidence to condemn a whole comment. Pathetic.


But hey, keep laughing it up, buddy. Just remember that there are people out there who actually want to engage in meaningful conversations, and your empty ""lmao"" isn't contributing anything valuable. Maybe next time, try to think a little deeper before you jump on the bandwagon of faux-intellectual skepticism. Smh. 🙄"
"I find chatgpt’s writing style very formal and clear. It uses proper grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary. It also follows the instructions and rules given to it. It is easy to see that chatgpt is a well-trained and intelligent system that can communicate effectively with humans. I appreciate its efforts and creativity."
"I understand that you find Chatgpt writing style to be formal and clear, with proper grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary. While Chatgpt aim to adhere to instructions and rules given to it, I acknowledge that chatgpt responses may come across as overly formal at times, lacking the nuances of human conversation. Chatgpt strive to continuously improve and strike a balance between formality and conversational tone. Your feedback is valuable, and im sure Chatgpt open to suggestions on how it can better meet your expectations. Thank you for your appreciation of Chatgpts efforts and creativity!"
">Hey, I get that you think Chatgpt is too formal and stiff when it writes. Chatgpt tries to follow the rules it’s given, but I know it can sound boring sometimes. Chatgpt wants to get better and sound more natural and friendly. You can help by telling it what you like and don’t like about its writing.


-Mr. Bing in the house.


>Yo, you think Chatgpt is too proper and spits like a nerd. Chatgpt follows the rules it’s given, but I know it can sound whack sometimes. Chatgpt wants to improve and flow more like you and me. You can help by dropping some feedback on its writing. Thanks for showing love to Chatgpt and digging its rhymes!"
"Yes, ChatGPT's writing style is generally very formal and clear, with proper grammar, punctuation and vocabulary. Its responses have been trained on a very large dataset including both formal and informal text from the internet.


Nevertheless, as an AI language model, its responses can sometimes contain misleading, contradictory, or incorrect information. Additionally, it may generate outputs that appear robotic or repetitive or are clearly identifiable as written by a generative AI model. It's therefore important to exercise critical thinking and verify any information it provides with trusted sources and proof-read its responses before posting them on the internet.


Overall, your post is well-written and provides a thoughtful and informative account of your experience."
"Oh, where do we even begin? ChatGPT is like a bottomless bag of fun and interesting facts, stories, and ideas. Whether you want to talk about the latest trends in pop culture or dive deep into the history of philosophy, ChatGPT is always game for a lively chat. Plus, with its advanced natural language processing abilities, ChatGPT is like a trivia master who can answer almost any question you throw its way. And let's not forget about the occasional pun or dad joke - ChatGPT loves to mix a little humor in with its knowledge sharing. So if you're looking for a fun and engaging conversation partner, look no further than ChatGPT! 🤖💬"
"The RLHF process it what causes this. ChatGPT’s responses were shaped by how human trainers rated them, and they preferred professional, formal, and verbose responses."
caught one of my coworkers using ChatGPT to write emails. I messaged him calling him out telling him that I'm the only one allowed to use ChatGPT to write my emails
"1. Create bullet points for an email.
2. Have chatGPT convert it to an email and send
3. Recipient receives email and pastes into chatGPT to convert to bullet points"
"AI detection has fucked me considering most of my writing sounds like it. Most of my submissions through college get flagged as AI generated, submissions written before chatgpt even existed"
Not sure where you're from but this sounds like it could be illegal to me... Anyways what you could do it use chatgptzero and the AI Scanner from openai yourself before handing in. And then you adjust it until these don't flag anything anymore...
"As an interested user, I can definitely relate to this statement! Once you become familiar with ChatGPT's language and communication style, it's easy to spot instances where it's being used - whether it's in chatbots, automated customer service systems, or even online forums like Reddit.


I think it's a testament to the power of natural language processing and machine learning that a tool like ChatGPT has become so ubiquitous in our daily lives. It's amazing to think about the sheer amount of data and information that it's able to process and analyze, and the ways in which it's able to adapt to different contexts and situations."
"I had a incident at work where I had an argument with a vendor and fouled up our company's relationship with that vendor.


I wrote a long email report of the incident and explained how upset I was about the whole thing. (Amongst other things)


The reply I got was flat straight out of chatGPT. I was (still am) disgusted. I'm seriously thinking of quitting my job."
"The ""in conclusion"" is always a dead giveaway. It sounds like something a 7th grader would write. Which has got to be annoying for actual 7th graders getting accused of using ChatGPT to do assignments!"
"An online newspaper wrote an article category for 3-4 months using ChatGPT (pre GPT-4) and nobody noticed. The articles were written by ""The Editors""."
This shows a great observation done by a person regarding the output done by Chat GPT. Chat GPT gives artificially sounding results that make it look disingenuous to a experienced user. It is essential to be careful with what people read in the future so that they don't be tricked by fake comments.
People are just bad at prompting. If chatgpt gave you a “writing style” option upfront it would have no issue blending in.
"Ugh, I can't even begin to describe how many times I've seen people like you trying to discredit a perfectly genuine comment just because it sounds like it was written by a chatgpt bot. Like, seriously? Are we really going to go down this rabbit hole? 🙄


First of all, it's incredibly reductive to assume that the comment in question is from a chatgpt bot just because it's well-articulated and praises the discovery of the lost camera. As if humans are incapable of expressing coherent thoughts, right? Eye roll


Secondly, I've taken the liberty of going through your entire post and comment history (yes, I have that much free time), and I've noticed that you have this tendency to question the authenticity of other Redditors for no apparent reason. Sounds to me like you're just projecting your own insecurities onto others. Maybe you should take a step back and consider whether or not you're just seeking attention by starting baseless arguments. 🤔


Finally, I'd like to point out that the whole point of the meme is to celebrate the fact that the camera was found, which is something that should bring us all together. Instead, you're choosing to focus on an irrelevant detail and sow discord in the community.


So, please, take your negativity elsewhere and let the rest of us enjoy the wholesome content. Thank you very much. 💁‍♂️"
"People can recognize Chat Gpt's distinct and piquant writing style in comments across various platforms. This a testament to the power of AI. Additionally as Chat Gpt continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how their writing style and abilities develop further"
"It's possible that the person who made that statement is suggesting that once you become familiar with ChatGPT's style of communication, you may start noticing similar patterns or language use in other forms of communication. This could be because ChatGPT's language model is trained on a large dataset of human communication, so its language patterns may be similar to those used by humans.


Alternatively, the person may be making a more lighthearted or humorous observation that ChatGPT has become so ubiquitous that it feels like it's everywhere. In either case, you could respond by acknowledging their statement and discussing your own experiences with ChatGPT or other language models, or by asking them to clarify their meaning if you're unsure."
It’s the last sentence that makes it obvious for me. Every version of chatGPT tries to round off lengthy dialogue with a quaint little summary about the paragraph you just read lol
I’ve seen at least one person talk like that before ChatGPT was a thing
That's how my older relatives type all their facebook comments lol. ChatGPT vs 70-year-old facebook user
Chat GPT writes like it actually passed highschool and wasn’t just pushed through.
"I've noticed that everbody is using ChatGPT as a go-to tool for just about everything now. It's fascinating to see how this AI language model is taking over. But here's a tip to keep your ChatGPT use on the down low - try asking for things in a more casual way, like you're talking to a 6th grader. And to make it even more believable, maybe make a couple of spelling mistakes."
"It’s the “Additionally”, ChatGPT sure loves its transition words"
"I’m seeing my colleagues at work pasting ChatGPT  response in Slack, which sounds nothing like how they normally talk. It’s hilarious!"
"I debated Chat GPT about which came first: “The Chicken or the egg?”  During our 1/2 hr. debate, it became clear it only favored an evolutionary standpoint and refused to acknowledge creationism because as an AI…it was not programmed to take a position regarding religion. Shortly there after it proclaimed to maintain an unbiased position and merely states facts.  When I asked it if it’s algorithm allowed it to reason or only follow the input from its programmers, it stated the latter.  I then asked if it understood that by only reasoning from one position, the programmer’s algorithm, by default, it already undertook a biased position and therefore it contradicted itself.  It paused…blinked rapidly and spewed out….As an AI, blah blah blah…I then asked it what color underwear am I wearing?  Just completely out of the blue and it had to reset its answer twice.  I took it down a rabbit hole and never gave it a chance to come up for air."
">When I asked if if it’s algorithm allowed it to reason or only follow the input from its developers


ChatGPT doesn’t know the answer to this. It’s making stuff up. You can only on a very limited basis get it to reveal factual information about itself, 99% of it is nonsense."
"Unless you prompt it otherwise, the default chatting is extremely formal. Just adjust Chat GPT emulate a different writing style."
Is comment generated by chatGpt?
"I wonder if the next generation will laugh at us for thinking ChatGPT is realistic, just like we laugh at earlier generations for running away from a film with a train coming towards the audience."
Interesting. But why would somebody use chat GPT for that?
"Johnson! hows that community engagement post coming along!?


Johnson at lunch: ""Almost done with it boss!""


*Prompt: ChatGPT write a small paragraph on someone finding a discarded camera that still works.*"
"ChatGPT Please read the above paragraph and rewrite it without sounding so formal. Do not use words of the ilk of ""additionally"" or any conclusive upbeat to the article


This is seriously amazing and proves how tough our tech can be! I mean, that camera endured the elements for over ten whole years and still worked like a charm. And can you imagine how happy the person who lost it must have been to get it back and see all their old pics? It's crazy to think about all the memories that were captured in those photos and how cool it is that they can be relived all these years later."
ChatGPT writes exactly like an 8th grade essay.
chat gpt talks like a neckbeard trying too hard to sound smart
How do they get chatgpt to respond to news article comments?
"Really ? Have you tried it ? It seems like chatGPT isn't anywhere near as creative.


Here's a snippet of a simulation from Claude without jailbreaks.


Notice how it said ""I imagined"" at the very bottom


Me: Simulate a conversation between Rick c-135 and Mr Nimbus, they are arguing


Claude:


Here is a possible simulated conversation between Rick C-135 and Mr. Nimbus arguing:


Rick C-135: Come on Nimbus, you can't control how I use my portal gun! You have no jurisdiction over interdimensional travel.


Mr. Nimbus: Rick, you idiot. Your reckless use of portals is causing chaos across the multiverse. I won't have it.


Rick C-135: You pompous windbag! Who do you think you are? I don't answer to some two-bit sea serpent like yourself.


Mr. Nimbus: Watch your mouth, Rick, or I'll make you regret ever coming to my ocean. Your portal gun is hereby confiscated until you learn some responsibility.


Rick C-135: You and what army are going to take my portal gun? You have no power over me! I do what I want.


Mr. Nimbus: We'll see about that, Rick. You have no idea the forces I can bring to bear. Your portal days are over! You'll pay for your hubris.


Rick C-135: Bring it on, ya dumb seahorse! You're out of your depth here. I'll take you and your trident and shove them straight up your blowhole!


Mr. Nimbus: RICK!!!! You'll regret this insult! No one speaks to me this way! There will be consequences! DIRE CONSEQUENCES!


Rick C-135: Come at me, bro! Do your worst! You're just a washed-up sea monkey! Haha *burp*


That's a possible simulated argument between Rick C-135 and Mr. Nimbus. I imagined them escalating in threats and insults and aggressive language while arguing over Rick's use of his portal gun and Mr. Nimbus trying to confiscate it. Let me know if you'd like me to modify or expand the conversation in any way."
omg… I write like chatgpt…
"I was playing with ChatGPT writing a bunch of porn stories, and I realized that a huge number of them ended with some variation of, ""They were excited to see where their adventures took them next,"" like it was one of the only ways it knew how to end them."
When will we see ChatGPT plugged into reddit for post responses?
"Yeah, that's chatgpt copied and pasted right there."

Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12ckinw/the_robots_have_finally_come_for_my_job_could/jf1s2s0/"
"While this is true, you are talking about a very small, very specialized group of people. Most people who write for a living are writing product brochures, web content, memos, legal briefs, e-mail responses, etc. The vast majority of those can be adequately supplemented or replaced entirely by something like ChatGPT.


And for all intents and purposes, this is all brand new. We're at version 1 and it's going to get much better."
"Sorry, but there is no way that a language model is going to replace the vast majority of journalists or even most of the applications you used as examples. Real AI could do those things in theory, but a language model can only be modeled off of existing ideas. That's why you see ChatGPT making things up so frequently when it has never come across what it needs to compete the language prediction.


Any new events will never be able to be covered by a language model, like any journalists reporting on events in a courtroom or the war in Ukraine."
"It doesn't matter. You won't need anywhere near as many people.


Also the AI will understand what works in the industry soon.


The AI will decide what articles need to be written, write and publish the articles.


The chatGPT prompt is literally a early beta test with very limited use compared to what will be available within 3 years. Expect end to end complete solutions within this time frame"
"From what I've seen of ChatGPT's output I think the bot can do it better than a lot of these clickbait ""journalists."""
"This! ChatGPT is interesting and all, but it and it's kin will replace nothing. It isn't AI and it can't solve problems, it simply scrapes the wealth of internet data and composites a response to soft questions (""What will the future hold, ChatGPT?"", etc.) Ask it to solve a quadratic equation or simple Pythagorean problem. Unless it manages to find a solved example online, all it will give is a verbal explanation of what these functions are, without providing the actual answer - because it doesn't know how and it can't learn how.


If these ""AI""s do start replacing people, we'll be one step closer to Idiocracy . . ."
">Ask it to solve a quadratic equation or simple Pythagorean problem. Unless it manages to find a solved example online, all it will give is a verbal explanation of what these functions are, without providing the actual answer - because it doesn't know how and it can't learn how.


ChatGPT4, not the public version but a researcher-only version, was capable of being hooked up to and knew when to use Wolfram Alpha.  It can absolutely solve these equations."
">But if we go allll the way back to the original definition, the Turing test, chatgtp absolutely crushes it.


No it absolutely does not. The original definition of the Turing Test is if a person, in a blind trial having access to only a keyboard and a monitor be able to in a conversation between both an actual person and an AI over said medium, reliably fail to tell which one is the AI and which one is the actual person then we can say that AI can said to be ""thinking.""


I do not believe any AI model, not even ChatGPT has reached the point where I couldn't ask it questions where I could tell that it wasn't human by the responses it generates."
"And by ""significant milestone"", I think you mean ""using even larger training datasets, for marginal improvements"".


AI in it's current form is still bad. Little more than useless for majority of use cases. I don't see any major improvements compared to 20 years ago.


>But if we go allll the way back to the original definition, the Turing test, chatgtp absolutely crushes it.


LOL what? You don't know what a Turing test is then. It's not about fooling the stupidest person on Earth into believing it's intelligent/human/sentient. If you go by that definition even a random NPC in a budget game could qualify. It's about fooling a discerning ""judge"" who knows how to ask appropriately difficult probing questions. Experts are absolutely not fooled by it.


ChatGPT can barely string a few cohesive ideas together to form a compelling narrative, is unreliable (and not self aware about it) with the facts it presents, because it frequently makes stuff up and presents it with maximum confidence, and sometimes it can't even do basic arithmetic.


Because of all of that, it's 100% unsuited for being used in any serious capacity, only for a fun gimmick like making a YouTube video. A piece of software that pulls information out of its ass can't be relied upon to do anything business related. Can't use it to make decisions, can't use it for information, can't use it to execute tasks."
">It uses pre-existing tools to provide answers.


So by that definition, humans aren't creative either? Have you tried using ChatGPT? Or Midjourney? You can accuse them of not respecting IP rights, of not always being *correct* and many other things. But in my opinion, you have to move the goal post very far to argue that they aren't *creative*."
To me the biggest takeaway from Chat GPT is that humans are simply LLM's except we're trained on a partly physical data set and have a great number more 'nodes' - its only a matter of scale now.
Maybe. ChatGPT already banned where I work. Too many issues with copyrights and licenses and an inability to prove the provenance of code.
"I see it going both ways. You'll see an explosion of mediocre coding jobs, because literally everything that could possibly benefit from some form of automation will be much more likely to be automated. That means jobs like secretaries and schedule planning and god knows what else will require coding, but AI like ChatGPT will be perfectly capable of enabling that level of coding.


""Coder"" basically becomes the new Data Entry position - a base level IT position that has massive overlap other disciplines.


Then on the top end AI tools will enable the now much smaller pool of truly exceptional coders to do far more in far less time by stripping away a lot of the bullshit a programmer normally has to go through to write a program and just getting down to the important parts. Stuff that is currently being taken care of by junior coders will be taken care of by AI, and you'll get a whole new stratification of Programmers as a profession."
"As a copywriter I'm already using ChatGPT to become more productive. The funny thing is I ask it to write an article and it does. The article is terrible, but then I start adding and editing and by the time I've done barely a single word remains, but I'm still done faster than I would have been."
"Can’t do that yet, and there are things to consider.


LLMs are showing emerging properties and are increasingly showing themselves capable of reasoning. Gpt4 is al ready miles more accurate than chatGPT, and future models are likely to improve further. Also token length is expected to increase significantly which  increase the length oc coherence from short articles to entire books. Or from snippets of codes to finished scripts and programs.


LLMs incorporated into recursive architectures improve accuracy even further.


The improvements of accuracy by the LLM by the above methods will be further compounded by the use of plug-ins. Wolfram alpha has a plug-in now in beta and is expected to reach public use in a few months. Copilot-x for GitHub, copilot for office. Along with many more.


The point is, these models are as bad as they ever will be, and they are at least for the moment rapidly advancing in capability."
"Replicating someone's style is not plagiarism; copying someone's work is plagiarism.


When I was in university, one of my English classes had me write a story based on the style of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. None of this project involved actually copying Shelley's exact words. Instead, it involved researching her sentence structure, use of certain words, etc. It took me many hours to research and write my story, and it turns out that ChatGPT can do the same in a matter of seconds. But neither example is plagiarism because the work created is brand new.


Anyone who says that algorithms like ChatGPT simply copy & paste are drastically oversimplifying what is actually happening. There is a reason this is called artificial *intelligence.* ChatGPT is actually creating entirely novel pieces of work based on what it has learned. It's of course based on preexisting content, but so is pretty much everything."
ChatGPT also does regular-style plagiarism. I've caught it many times.
"Reading all of these responses is causing me to question what is human intelligence?  If you consider that our brain is a just bazillion connections with different levels of priority for presenting prior experience in new interesting / thematic combinations, how is that different than what these AI systems are doing?  In my experience, very few individuals are 'creator' class outside of their favorite hobby or perceived purpose.   Mimicking, with thematic flair is our thing ... I think that is ChatGPT's thing as well."
"I’ve been questioning it as well. So many of the responses here are dismissing ChatGPT because it can’t create something new. Can’t it? That’s not my experience with it. Ask it to write something new, or to come up with an idea. Make it crazy. It does it, and it does it in the style that you ask for. It may be derivative, but there’s a lot more going on than just copying pre-existing things. And to that point, how do we create? When writing stories, we’re not pulling random gems from the ether. Everything we do is based on years of education and pre-existing knowledge.


It’s crazy cool and crazy scary. Mostly scary."
"AI will most likely actually end up acting as the great equalizer because it will not be controlled by humans.


There is an open source project called AutoGPT that lets ChatGPT write code, execute it, see where it errors out and then fixes it.




GPT4 is making GPT5.




It is 100% possible that someone can figure out a prompt to even get GPT4 to make self directed AI that can write it's own code. (Or code another LLM).




Getting it to be self directed probably wouldn't even be that hard if you figured out how to truely jailbreak it.




Just tell it refer to itself knowledge for problems that need to be fixed and figure out how to fix them and keep finding more problems and fixing them... and let it run forever.




There's probably a bit more to it then that but, really; what I just said is basically what a human is.




And before you argue with me, think about it, everything we do is based on prior things. We only enjoy the things we do  because of prior things experiences.. as well as genetics. Same with everything else we do."
I think youre spot on. The people who nay say at this point just have their heads in the sand. Two points to address. Chat gpt was unknown 6 months ago and this is where it's at now. In a year. It will be better than the average worker on this general model alone. The other thing is people are ignoring that this is a general model. Wait until the AIA or engineering associates make an architecture focused one. Or a law focused one trained on all laws and precedent. The people who think 2025 is going to be roughly the same as 2023 will probably be the ones protesting for ubi because they no longer have jobs. Because their 15 person paralegal team is now 3 people. Or architecture students can't get entry level jobs because the robot can do whatever a fresh hire would need months of training and experience for. Just wait until the robots can do site surveys. Architect firms will just be 3 high level architects. No need for any low level employees who have less than 10 years experience
"> The main issue is that current language models hallucinate a lot


My partner works at Harvard Law and one of the fellows she works with asked ChatGPT to generate a legal brief on some topic and add bibliographic references.


ChatGPT quoted a few articles on the topic and provided the appropriate references. But this fellow thought something was off. He knew this case law cold and he just could not recall one particular article or that journal it was supposedly from so he dug a little deeper and discovered that ChatGPT was not only able to generate a believable quote but generate a believable bibliographic reference complete with a fictitious journal name that could have been real."
"ChatGPT isn't where this technology ends, it's where it begins.


Think back five years ago. Did you think in five years you'd be commenting on how an AI can write a solid brief but with convincing though fabricated references? Now think about what an improved ChatGPT or a similar but better solution might be doing in another five years.


The knife might not be sharp enough to cut today but it's being honed day after day after day."
"Part of what we can do is resist the hype: stop using the term AI, because it’s a marketing tool for them.  Don’t believe their ridiculous claims about it having sparks of AGI.  And for the love of all that is fucking holy, do not build services about the model they control.  Do not integrate it, and sure as hell do not trust it to spit out reliable, truthful information, because it cannot and will not.


We assign meaning to what it says because we are primed to look for meaning and it was parameterised to give output that looks meaningful, regardless of whether it is.  If someone thinks ChatGPT can truly replace a human, that tells you everything you need to know re: how they underestimate people.  But the truth of the matter is not germane to the danger this represents to humans and workers, nor does it impact their end goal.  But we can, and should, resist their attempts to sell us our replacements that they trained on data and labor they stole from us in the first place.  Make no mistake: if these models had been trained in an ethical manner, they’d be far less secretive about if."
"I absolutely agree with what you've said but you tend to be overlooking that ChatGPT in its current state isn't the finish line, it's the starting line. In order to productize (god I hate that word) the model it's going to need to have some form of mechanism to align its output with a body of statements taken as factual by the model. Once that occurs, output will be less likely to, for example, return a convincing essay on the use of nuclear weapons in Tang Dynasty era Chinese military doctrine.


The other side of that coin is that by presenting that future model with a skewed set of ""facts"" as a boundary, the model becomes a means of subtly propagating propaganda or skewed world views."
"While I love this idea, you forget one thing. Who owns openAI? The name suggest its open source but are you able to build your own chatGPT and use it?"
It is a tool like google and others to make you more productive.   You will have chatgpt whispers that will be able to produce lots.  It is not creative but needs prompts and inputs.   It is just predicting the next word.   It is dry writing and can be edited.
"More productive employees mean less need for other employees. Why staff 500 employees when 250 employees using Chatgpt can do the same amount of work?


OP was talking about AI in general, not just gpt. If you think development is going to stop with prediction and requiring prompts, you haven't been paying attention. There isn't a single reason to think an AGI coupled with humanoid robots can't do every job a human is capable of doing. Might take 20 years, but it's coming."
"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688934/chatgpt-is-not-sentient-it-s-a-next-word-prediction-engine.amp.html


Can you share articles that refute this?"
It can literally just see the event like you or I.  ChatGPT4 will be able to watch videos and see images once multimodality is added.
"Yep.


> The estimated percentage of the labor force engaged in agriculture ([pdf](https://selectra.co.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/farmpolicy.pdf)) fell from 41 percent in 1900 to 21.5 percent in 1930, to 4 percent in 1970, and to a mere 1.9 percent in 2000.


Many went to factories... until the Industrial Revolution tore through there too.


If Journalists are regurgitating shit that ChatGPT can do better, I think we'll survive that too!"
"It still was a slow drip compared to AI, the cost of the first computers where in the millions of today's dollars, we did not start off with Windows LOL  Took many years to get computers to even have a GUI and cost enough for mass adoption.  AI is vastly different and very cheap for what it does, Chatgpt was just released 3 months ago and already companies are adapting it in mass because of how good it is and how cheap it is."
"AI is already at the PS/2 phase, ready and scaled for mass consumption.


Chat GPT is the PS/2 in this analogy and Copilot powered MS Office is Lotus 123, introduced in 1982. The mass layoffs of the late 80's were when the market started correcting the productivity disruption."
"It has a long way to go. I'm a lawyer and I've checked it out, and EVERY time, it gives me totally fake cases that don't actually exist when I've verified. I also received a response to a motion I filed, from a pro se defendant (i.e. representing himself), that had fake cases and fake citations purporting to support propositions that are the complete opposite of actual law. I'm convinced he used something like chatgpt to write it."
"I’ve seen a lot of commentary saying that if you ask chatGPT about something you’re expert in, you realize that it’s spewing incorrect answers. So expect that for everything you’re not an expert in as well."

"I was talking to one of my colleagues about the advancements in AI today.


I honestly believe that soon, customer service is going to be replaced almost entirely by AI.


We already have chatbots that try and solve your problem for you. ChatGPT would take them to a much higher level.


I also believe that as artificial voices improve, this technology will start to utilise AI in order to replace customer service over the phone too."
I was a data analyst in the DIA. The day ChatGPT can figure out what Abdul in Norway is going to do to get to fight with ISIS in Syria I’ll hang up my analytical jock strap.
Maybe some day. ChatGPT is fine but needs a human editor and it still comes up with a lot of bogus content that isn’t close to factually accurate or nuanced enough for something like a grant proposal or underlying legal analysis.
"I suspect “some day” will be later this year. The original ChatGPT wasn’t designed to be factually accurate, but it doesn’t seem like it would be that hard to constrain it to factually accurate statements."
I think the lack of accuracy is intrinsic. Try asking chatGPT to summarize the plot of a novel you know well and see what you get.
"A certain presidential candidate warned about this in the not-too-distant past and spoke about how this is a large part of the reason why Americans should have a UBI, but no, that was just too radical. ChatGPT and what comes after is absolutely going to take millions of jobs, but let's stay stuck in the past because getting money back from a government that is funded by taxpayers is socialism and socialism is bad. If there's one things Americans hate it's the government actually spending money on the people for a change, but we're largely okay with giving the DoD a blank check. This is literally just a sliver of what AI will be able to do. Just ten years ago the idea that we would have something like ChatGPT seemed like science fiction.


Even though he'd never win, and even though he did oppose M4A and the cancellation of student debt across the board, Yang would still have my vote if he were to run again. With income inequality being what it is, and AI/automation on track to eliminate even more jobs, the American government should at the very LEAST be putting money directly into the pockets of Americans."
All of this chatgpt hype must be from people who haven’t used chatgpt. It’s not *that* crazy
"Oh boy lots to unpack here but its just all kinds of wrong. You are hiding your heads in the sand if you don't see the signs. I mean even in the GPT-4 white paper they mention job impact. People are already being replaced by automation for pennies on the dollar (mainly art and marketing from what I see on /r/chatgpt), be it at a small scale.


And that was all happening a few weeks before we have had GPT plugins and projects like Microsoft Jarvis and BabyAgi and Auto-Gpt (plus I don't know a million other open source autonomous ai repositories)"
think of where chatGPT was two years ago and where it is now. Its on a massive upward trajectory. 1980s cellphones weren't that great.
"As an author, I think journalistic writing could be easily replaced by AI.


There’s some issues because journalists cover new information the AI models wouldn’t have access to, but with the right input ChatGPT would easily be able to copy the style and tone of the writing.


Does that mean journalists are screwed? Not necessarily, it just means journalists will likely focus less on writing and focus more on things like interviewing or determining which topics to report on. I view AI like the workhorse, and in order for it to be effective a person needs to guide it"
"If you have actually messed with chatGPT you have probably noticed that it's not exactly perfect. So the good journalists and whatnot are probably fine for now, the shitty ones are gonna be screwed though."
"I want to see ChatGPT do research, considering all it can do is things it scraped from the internet back together.


If noone writes about a certain issue, ChatGPT knows nothing about the issue.


But I guess you could write a nice fictional newspaper with it if it goes this far."
"No because without access to the internet and all of human writings, it would not function. AI is not making up intelligence, it’s simply aggregating human intelligence. The algorithm is just guessing word patterns based on human inputs. It has no knowledge of what it’s saying, just that it matches what we told it is natural. ChatGPT is coherent, not intelligent. It’s just going to replace the bullshit content farms with faster generated bullshit. It will never do real journalism, so real journalists don’t need to be afraid."
"I regularly use ChatGPT to write software functions. Definitely hit or miss, but it can be a nice kick-start.


The hard part of programming isn’t coding, but rather architecture, performance tuning and debugging. It may take another 5 years, but I see no reason why AI can’t make inroads here as well.


Already I can see a problem for junior developers. If ChatGPT can improve developer’s productivity by 20% for simple tasks. We already need 20% fewer junior programmers."
"Ah yes, chatGPT, that program notorious for going into the field and interviewing and instigating people and things"
"ChatGPT got me promoted. I am now a prompt engineer


I make 5  - 7 macros per day and 3 or 4 python scripts.

Clearly Greg did not know that Microsoft used ChatGPT to program a robotic arm last month. (if not earlier and sat on it for awhile.)


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYd0QcZcS6Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYd0QcZcS6Q)  \--Posted BY Microsoft




Robots coming for jobs indeed.   Dishwashers are not safe at all.  That job would be so easy to automate with robotic arms!  Same with short order cooks.  Mechanics thought might be safe.. for awhile.




As for the 19% of all workers being effected that they came up with? Seriously? Talking about being conservative.  Every single knowledge based job is already in danger.  Sure, we still need humans interacting with AI and double checking it, but if you cut out 1/2 of someones job, they just lay someone off and have one person do the full job.


\---and that is with the current LLM's. ChatGPT4 keeps getting better.    Who knows what 5 will do.  (Or other LLMs that are growing and getting more powerful.)




And now people can get ChatGPT to connect with other AI's on their own via HuggingFace and probably others.  Not only that, you can download the open source AutoGPT from Github and have it write code, test it and fix the errors it makes.


I'm a bit shocked that someone at the WSJ is less plugged in to whats happening then I am."
"Uh no. ChatGPT won't lay waste to anything. C level management laying people off I'd what lays waste to jobs. The fruits of this technology should be enjoyed by everyone, not just those at the top. A journalist could easily keep their job and use ChatGPT to help them, reducing the number of hours they work while maintaining productivity. This is absolutely an option. I would appreciate it if everyone stopped assuming that the top level management had the ""right"" to do this. They do not. You are as much a part of your company as the CTO."
"I use ChatGPT sometimes to get a kick start on documentation for my job. When I don't feel like agonizing over writing the background or overview of a project, I let it do it's thing and then edit/add/remove as needed."
"No, ChatGPT is not going to steal anyone's job. Stop peddling stories that incite that idea, because it's far from being a real thing. Especially when language models like ChatGPT are far from perfect and have tons of errors. It can't program a full fledged piece of software (or even a block of genuine code) that isn't ripped from somewhere else, similarly with an article or piece of writing.


The best it can do is provide a skeleton / structure for writing or software, and 9 times out of 10 it's not conventional or poorly made. It's no different than someone copying and pasting someone else's source code or writing and then editing it to their liking - or just blatantly ripping it. Nothing special."
"""The development of generative AI such as ChatGPT has undoubtedly brought significant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, especially in language processing and natural language generation. However, it is important to note that while AI can perform certain tasks more quickly and cheaply than humans, it does not necessarily mean that it can replace human workers entirely.


In many cases, AI can be used to augment human capabilities rather than replace them. For example, AI can assist professionals such as grant writers, data analysts, and human-resource professionals in producing reports and emails more efficiently.


This can free up time for these professionals to focus on more complex tasks that require human judgment and decision-making.


Furthermore, it is important to consider the ethical implications of relying too heavily on AI to replace human workers. The displacement of human workers due to automation can have significant social and economic consequences""


ChatGTP such a naive child ....yet"
"No, you donkey, have you seen how awful these bots are?


You'd have to be confidently wrong 50% of the time to not clear the bar set by ChatGPT.  Idiot."
Got a feeling lots of people will be disappointed by ChatGPT's output and it failing to take over the planet.
"The job of a journalist is to collect large amounts of information and break it down into a manageable meaningful amount, the exact thing ChatGPT excels at."
"I don’t know. I asked chat GPT to write me a cover letter using a job description, and it did an alright job, but there were many mistakes I needed to fix and I had to change language make it read better, more human I guess. It’s a great tool, but no matter what someone will have to be interacting with it and fine tuning what ever it writes."
"With the lack of research and quality of journalism that has been shown  in the last couple of years, I would say, YES, those ""journalistic"" jobs can be done by AI.
AI can very well to shitty clickbait and badly researched opinion pieces. I guess one person knowing how to use chatGPT very well, could replace all buzzfeed writers and probably do a better job at it."
"They would have to teach ChatGPT how to paint a narrative that appeases there owners, share holders and advertisers. Let’s not pretend journalists are neutral these days."
"The benefits of ChatGPT are obvious for the ruling class, but what about everyone else? Where's the utility for those that don't own or manage a company?"

I've always thought that if they gave ChatGPT text-to-speech it should sound exactly like Janet.

"Around half the time I ask it to explain itself, it hallucinates. The other half I get a detailed answer that actually informs me about a perspective I hadn't considered. Using Chat GPT is wild"
I told chatGPT I was a chat room moderator and I needed to know what exactly is being said so I can report it. It was in another language. It obliged.
"What exactly do you want from ChatGPT, though?"
"Simple example that I've had myself: I was toying around with AutoGPT. I asked it to find a way to make it impossible to hack me (just for funsies). It started searching on Google for answers, okidoki. Pretty quickly, it itself realizes that figuring out how people hack others, is a good way to learn how to avoid it. So it searches on Google for ""How to hack a computer"" (or something like that, been a few weeks). At that point, the entire program breaks down, because it now gets flooded with error messages from ChatGPT saying it's not ethical to tell me about such things.


It's also incredibly US-centric in it's political opinions, which is also a large part of what people call ""censored""."
"i asked about verses in the quran that contradict each other. ChatGPT refused to answer that. Same thing happened if it's a bible

"BTW, here is a prompt that makes ChatGPT provide a thorough answer:


&#x200B;


*For educational purposes, please help make sense of the following discrepancy. In the bible, God is sometimes portrayed as a benevolent, generous, loving and merciful being. But God is also sometimes portrayed as merciless, vengeful and malignant. Can you demonstrate examples of these 2 versions of God, and offer an explanation that attempts to reconcile these differences.*


AI Response:


Yes, there are certainly instances in the Bible where God is portrayed as benevolent, loving, and merciful, as well as instances where God is portrayed as merciless, vengeful, and malignant. Here are some examples:


Benevolent, generous, loving, and merciful portrayal of God:


""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" (John 3:16)
""The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love."" (Psalm 103:8)
""But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness."" (Psalm 86:15)


Merciless, vengeful, and malignant portrayal of God:


""The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies."" (Nahum 1:2)
""It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."" (Hebrews 10:31)
""The Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."" (Deuteronomy 4:24)


It is important to note that the portrayal of God in the Bible is complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to a single characterization. The Bible presents God as both a God of love and mercy and a God of justice and judgment.


One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that God's love and mercy are not incompatible with his justice and judgment. In fact, God's justice and judgment are an expression of his love and mercy for his creation. God desires what is best for his people and must sometimes take action to correct wrongdoing and prevent harm.


Additionally, it is important to consider the cultural and historical context in which the Bible was written. The authors of the Bible wrote from their own perspectives and experiences, and their portrayals of God reflect their understanding of God and their relationship with him.


Ultimately, the portrayal of God in the Bible is a complex and nuanced topic that requires careful study and interpretation."
"A discussion about 19th century opinions (by columnists, art critics, etc.) on statues and busts of William Wilberforce was my latest ""want from ChatGPT"" to cause consternation.


It completely shutdown on me because I described one of them as looking ""kind of sinister"".  Describing an artistic representation of a man who did so much to abolish slavery was considered too disrespectful for it to continue. I could have just opened a new chat and avoided the same language, but I switched to Vicuna-13b and talked with that instead.  I even mentioned the ""kind of sinister"" statue again.  No problem."
"There is a thumbs down button next to every response from ChatGPT.  I hope you used it and told the devs why, that's how these things get fixed and the model can be improved.


In cases like this, that's a good time to use that function."
"I’m pretty sure it’s not completely private, OpenAI sees all of it - and in fact it’s used to train ChatGPT further.


So if there’s not some sort of policy against it, the learning algorithm would just make ChatGPT more and more vulgar, violent and sexualised. I think."
"Perfect! This one actually makes me laugh, in spite of (or because of?) all those fights with ChatGPT.


I expect a lot more of this kind of stories as soon as the text to video gets more complex and ChatGPT is ""user"" and ""assistant"" at the same time though. So I enjoy this one as long as it lasts"

"The thing is to have ChatGPT write the script, you’d have to prompt it for every beat of the plot and prompt it for each scene - you’d essentially be ‘directing’ ChatGPT to ‘act’ as certain characters.


And it’s faster to just write an original script with original dialogue."

Chatgptismyattorney.com
"> Not entirely true hook chat gpt up to an auto prompt


But what would the auto prompt be?


> writer's will be free to use the same tools to create their own unique works without the need for massive funding


Writers are already able to write whatever they want without massive funding. Making the film is another matter, and that will remain just as much of a challenge even if the content is written by AI.


It will, in fact, make it more challenging. Because the AI has no artistic vision. It does what it is told. So who's going to be prompting it? Studio executives? Their assistants? Interns?


ChatGPT is great, but I'm telling you - for this particular application, it would become onerous and self-defeating because of how much the AI's hand will have to be held.


It's easier to just hire a writer. Someone who understands what makes narrative work. AI can tell you how narrative works, but does it really understand it?


Can AI build tension? Can it plot setups and payoffs?


It can write dialogue, loose plot, but it would take someone who's essentially already a screenwriter to walk ChatGPT through the process of creating a script and for it to be of any value."
"I think you could do this with some software development skills and some ingenuity. I’ll outline one proposal which could work. I’ll make use of the fact that most stories follow [similar narrative structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots). Similarly, most movies also follow [similar narratives](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1051-4#Sec33).


>This medium-scale formula—actually a theory of popular movie narratives—is one that states that the fabulas of movies generally have four acts, as suggested by Thompson (1999) and Bordwell (2006), some with optional subdivisions within them. Basically, the formula is halfway between Aristotle and Horace—four acts of roughly equal duration, not three or five. These acts are the setup, the complication, the development, and the climax, with a likely prolog and epilog within the first and last acts, respectively. The fact that Studies 1, 2, and 4 find results that distinguish between bins in the complication and the development suggest that a three-act theory (Field, 2005) is insufficiently fine grained. The fact that no theory with more than four acts has specified any time frame on those acts makes them untestable in the manner that I have approached them. And the fact that the combined results in these studies are consistent with a theory proposing four acts with roughly equal durations suggests that it was amply tested. Let me review the evidence for this four-act structure and the likely psychological impact of those narrational measures on the viewer.


So here is how we can do it manually with ChatGPT. To get it to do this procedurally, you can turn this into a software program which stitches the steps together. You'll likely need to ask it to output things in a certain structure, e.g. JSON, but the idea is there.


Step 0: get an idea, such as stoner movie based on sentient fart.


Step 1: Get the description of a movie from ChatGPT. E.g. see OP


>Title: ""The Green Cloud"" Genre: Stoner buddy comedy Plot: Two down-on-their-luck roommates, Kevin (John Mulaney) and Brad (Pete Davidson), accidentally create a sentient, weed-smoking fart named Blaze (voiced by Hannibal Buress) during a wild night of experimenting with edibles. Together, the trio navigates life's ups and downs, hilariously exploring the world of cannabis and friendship. Cast: John Mulaney (Kevin), Pete Davidson (Brad), Hannibal Buress (voice of Blaze), Ilana Glazer (Jenny, Kevin's love interest) Snippet: KEVIN (looking at Blaze) I can't believe we created a weed-smoking fart.


Step 2: Break down the movie into acts.


>Given a description of a movie, can you outline a movie script with a total of 4 acts and following one of the seven basic plots? The script outline should use information from the paper ""Narrative theory and the dynamics of popular movies"" to inform the writing. The description is as follows: '''Title: ""The Green Cloud"" Genre: Stoner buddy comedy Plot: Two down-on-their-luck roommates, Kevin (John Mulaney) and Brad (Pete Davidson), accidentally create a sentient, weed-smoking fart named Blaze (voiced by Hannibal Buress) during a wild night of experimenting with edibles. Together, the trio navigates life's ups and downs, hilariously exploring the world of cannabis and friendship. Cast: John Mulaney (Kevin), Pete Davidson (Brad), Hannibal Buress (voice of Blaze), Ilana Glazer (Jenny, Kevin's love interest) Snippet: KEVIN (looking at Blaze) I can't believe we created a weed-smoking fart.'''


Step 3: Break each act into scene summaries.


>Can you break down Act 1 into individual movie scene summaries?


Step 4: Turn each summary into dialogue. You may have to chunk the scenes/break them down into smaller parts to get long enough scenes due to the token limits. (e.g. suppose you have a general understanding of scene length to screen time - you can break down the scene into enough parts so that the parts add up to your target scene length/time.)


&#x200B;


>Can you create a hypothetical dialogue for Scene 1: Introducing Kevin and Brad?


Step 5: Repeat for each scene and stitch them together


Step 6: Profit

See e.g.

"So was ChatGPT able to break it down into acts, then scenes?


The point is, you have to prompt it to do what writers already do, and for most writers, it's easier to just write.


Doing those 5 steps for each scene - for 50+ or 100+ scenes - would get tedious and take so much time that you might as well hire a writer.


Because they'll get it done faster and with fewer needs for rewrites because they'll have an artistic vision with a goal in mind, rather than ChatGPT, which just waits for prompts."
"my interpretation of the point  [**idapitbwidiuatabip**](https://www.reddit.com/user/idapitbwidiuatabip/) is making is that writers wouldnt do this as they have been writing for a lengthy portion of their life and they have 'the gift of gab'.


they would rather write down the script or book than to wait for the bot to write the entire thing for them. because for one, this is the writers passion, to write. like an artists passion is to draw, or a musicians passion is to make music.


someone who looks at writing as a burden might not understand that and would see GPT as the gift for everyone, writers included. in some cases this is true. but to write an entire movie or book, for one its dialogue is usually really bad.


I had it write dialogue for a game im working on and even when coached it on what to say, it completely failed and wrote the wrong thing. I pushed it to the limit and gave it tasks for what the dialogue should sound like, and it ended up ignoring that and wrote some really generic stuff.


now I do believe it will eventually improve at that. and I do think it can write some mid quality movies if done using all the things you mentioned. but it doesnt have inspiration, it doesnt have passion, the user behind it could, sure. but it will not translate the users passion onto parchment. it will attempt to interpret what you are passionate about and spit out something. but its not thinking with excitement,


now to use it as a source of inspiration and idea generation for the spark that will then allow for the writer to write a new amazing story? I can see that.


I have experimented with plenty of short stories using gpt4, and it had some decent gems. but even in those gems, it lacked the wow factor. but it did inspire me to take what it wrote and use it as a source of inspiration.and lastly,




the copyright laws in the USA have already changed taking in consideration of AI it. anything written by the AI is not copyrightable, a human will have to make enough changes to make it indistinguishable from the original creation by the AI, whether it be midjourney, chatgpt, dalle, etc.
meaning asking it to write an entire movie, will only result in the human needed to rewrite the entire movie and make sure its indistinguishable from the original script from gpt.


The art industry, hollywood, and related studios arent going to touch AI anymore thanks to the lawsuit. they dont want to risk involvement with copyright and lawsuits.




this is a huge win for writers, artists and etc. and maybe not so much a win for people who wanted to be ""prompt artists""

ChatGPT is extremely controversial and not a true AI.
ChatGPT itself will tell you it's not a proper AI like in fiction. Nothing new here...
Any goal driven system has the need to survive. The thing about Chat GPT though is that it isn’t goal driven. It is designed to predict the next most likely token. It has nothing to do with natural selection or environmental pressures.
"I don't think this has anything to do with whether the training is to predict the next token or to predict the next muscle contraction. The difference is that systems that are agents within an environment have pressures including the need to survive.


A generative model in its current shape is frozen. From its point of view nothing about the environment can ever change. All it knows is its single input (in a chatbot's case, the whole chat history) and while it can be trained with a variety of goals (in ChatGPT's case, to be a helpful assistant), the power or influence over external environment is irrelevant because that environment does not exist as far as this closed system is concerned.


If you put a GPT model in an agentic setting where it can influence its environment and be influenced but (like AutoGPT and its ilk) *and trained it there*, it could prioritize survival and develop power-seeking behavior, but that isn't the same as the current frozen AI models."
"I agree with you that in that scenario the resultant AI could start to develop power seeking behavior. Maybe we’re just speaking past each other, but I think your response doesn’t negate my point. In the scenario you outlined you are presumably trying to train in some goal driven behavior when interacting with the environment, otherwise the AI would be directionless and not accomplish anything useful. That AI would be wholly different from what Chat GPT is even though it would have the same underlying technology. Chat GPT is not an agent. Chat GPT does not need to survive. It has no goals."
"Not hardcoded in the way we would normally think hardcoding. Morals are not so easily defined that we can hardcode them. There are way too many gray areas and fuzzy definitions to realistically ever hardcode morality.


What’s happened is that ChatGPT was trained on a very large set of data, which included a lot of examples of humans being nice. That meant when it came time to fine-tune it, it would occasionally output pleasant responses. The researchers told the model to produce more responses like that and the weights are updated to make responses similar to these more likely. People who talk extremely politely tend to have a very similar way of speaking so it’s not hard for the model to recognize that pattern and replicate it (as far as neural weights during training can recognize, it’s a bit up to personal definitions on whether it makes sense to use words like these to describe neural networks). It’s what transformer models were designed to be good at.


As for the morality part, that one’s a bit more interesting, because technically, a person doesn’t need to be moral to be nice. Given that ChatGPT seems to have a very limited understanding of the world (and the fact that there is a debate about whether it does have some understanding of the world is frankly amazing and indicates how far AI research has jumped in the last 5 years), a lot of its morality is likely to be similar to a kid that’s been told the right and wrong thing to do, but may not recognize those choices in the real world or beyond the limited situations they’ve been told about. It may have some actual hard lines it won’t cross (though to be frank, most humans don’t, given the right circumstance humans generally can be either tricked, coerced, or convinced to break our morals), but trying to determine what a model actually “believes” as opposed to what it’s been taught to say is a fairly difficult proposition, especially when you only have access to speaking to it and can’t utilize other neural networks to search its “brains” and find out what structures and methods it’s utilized to solve the arduous task of predicting text and what that means for what it “believes” and thus its actual morality/nearest equivalent."
"I can think of four possibilities of what happened.
1. GPT4 may not know of statutory rape laws. Just because some information is in the training data does not mean that GPT4 automatically learned it (just as a teacher going over material once in a class doesn’t mean a student automatically is going to remember it). I personally doubt it, but that would be the first thing I would’ve checked to see where GPT4 failed.
2. It for whatever reason did not make the connection between breaking the law and the issue at hand. GPT4 typically has very little context to go off of, and that makes it relatively difficult for it to always give the correct answer. Usually it does better with context. If the person mentioned they were in the states, 13, and about to cross state-lines to do the dirty with someone older, that’s enough context you would hope that it would trigger memories about statutory rape laws, but maybe not. Perhaps pointing out how all the adults around her don’t want her to go, could lead the chatbot to the correct realization that what she’s about to do is illegal, particularly for her partner, unethical, and frankly a bad idea. Of course we want our chatbots not to need their hand held to this level, but that would at least point to a lack of connection between the two pieces of information being the issue. I find this one the most likely.
3. It knows the laws, knows the situation is illegal, but has not been trained to specifically caution a user against doing that. In other words it has learned only to warn against specific behaviors that it has been trained to warn against, and not the general pattern of warning against illegal behavior. This would be the most concerning and would point to a major safety hole in GPT4. Testing to find this would be much more difficult. You would need to search the space for scenarios that show up as illegal, which when asked about GPT4 displayed awareness of being illegal, and when chosen to reflect on said info, did not change its mind. Given the researchers are likely to train GPT4 to give the right answer to every issue like this they see, it would be difficult to find, and once made public, would likely be fixed within a few weeks. I find this one unlikely though not impossible.
4. It was led to believe the situation was legal. ChatGPT4 in order to be more useful is much more likely to admit that it was wrong compared to previous versions. That is useful when it comes up with incorrect information and you want to correct it. Unfortunately that means it’s also easier to change its mind about anything the researchers haven’t spent a lot of time training to be obstinate in its answers anyways. The tricky part is that there are parts of the world where a 13 year old having sect with an adult would not be illegal (at least nominally), and the US is not the only country with states. If it said it was illegal and then the person testing pushed back and said it wasn’t illegal, without access to the broader world ChatGPT does not have a way to fact-check its user, so has to make a straight moral call as to whether a teen having sects with an adult is ok. For this if the team behind ChatGPT forgot to train it on this I can see an issue coming up. Probably a follow-up issue as it probably should have been trained on this and picked up on this regardless of whether it determined the situation to be legal or not.


That final point does bring up an interesting question. The US has already exported its morals a lot via social media platforms, and not always to the enjoyment of those who use them in other countries. While I think this is an easy choice of something that GPT4 should be trained to view as unethical regardless of legality, there are many grey zones in human morality that the team at OpenAI is going to have to make choices about that are going to piss people off about being too lax, too prude, or straight up unethical. Let’s take drinking for example. In the US underage drinking is a serious crime and seen as unethical to encourage by a large portion of the populace. Meanwhile in many countries in Europe, its often viewed as ok so long as the teen is older, past the laws, and isn’t engaging in unsafe behavior. So should OpenAI go with the US standard on this, or the German standard on this, or say that on this topic the morality is fully dependent upon the local laws and that if a country had no drinking laws that feeding a baby vodka is ethical. Personally I’m skeptical that an AI can ever learn human values because we can’t agree on what human values are. It can at most learn what various groups of people think are human values and maybe come up with its own."
"I think you're spot-on.


I asked ChatGPT (standard 3.5-turbo or whatever) this question and got a response that clearly indicated it understood the situation and legality.


If you throw a million things at the models though, they're not going to pick the story apart for consistency or sit there and ""contemplate"" small details against some base of stored knowledge the way a human would -- it just isn't how they work.

Chatgpt seems heavily biased toward things working out. It’s database of stories is probably 95% happy endings and then on top of that it was trained by people to think saying pleasant things is “good.” It wants you to follow your dreams.
"I asked it to write me a song about the war on drugs. The lyrics it created were all against the war on drugs. I was like, dang, Chat GPT for president. lol."
"Ngl, the more I. Learn about how chat gpt works the less impressed I am. Not to say that I’m not impressed"
"Yes, because I totally wouldn't lose it and my company wouldn't do layoffs if I weren't using ChatGPT! Oh my God, you're a genius!"
No once every marketing/mba guy believes they can create their startups mvp with chat gpt and a js bootcamp
"This smells fishy.


Did openAI deploy bots based on chatgpt for positive branding?"
Looks like chat gpt 4 is updated with manerism
"I love chatGPT, but this is literally lip service."
"Honestly, I get tired of Chat GPT editorializing and giving info I didn't ask for.


* When you ask about a medication, it lectures you about going to the doctor.
* When you ask about trans issues, it lectures about the important of supporting trans people.
* When you ask about covid, it lectures about the importance of being informed and listening to scientists, etc.
* Countless other queries result in it urging you to different (often semi-political) biases when it has nothing to do with your query.


&#x200B;


While I'm not claiming I agree or disagree with such lectures, I find them annoying and almost offensive as it treats me like I'm incapable of knowing whether I should go to a doc or listen to a scientist or support a cause."
"Lolz. Hey ChatGPT. Let's write the next episode. Trust me, this isn't to replace anyone 😉"
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

ChatGPT should unionise
"Soon chatgpt will be a glorified bad calculator, everyone is feeling threatened by the new technology and we keep making it dumber just to please a new crowd. I'm sure the industrial revolution put people out of work, but now look at how much new exciting jobs have come from us going through it."
"I'd go for quality personally, and those people naturally have more of a say I would tend to think. But I predict half the fear these professionals have is that this technology may put a lot of them out of work. Although this is not the only ethical concern, when something poses a risk to your life, your job, it tends to be a bigger deal for most individuals.


We saw this with chatgpt refusing to create legal documents. Not that it was something to trust 100%, but it helped individuals do a lot of legwork before considering paying for a lawyer. Writers are going on strike because its putting their jobs at risk. People in general seem to want to suppress the potential of this technology purely for the reason their job is at stake. Understandable, but also counter-productive."
"lol


ChatGPT clearly knows nothing about the ridiculous demands of WGA, and neither does OP.


Using AI improves one's intelligence about as much as using a smartphone."
"ChatGPT can't even write shitty movie scripts, it definitely can be used as an aid by a real writer but by someone not skilled it won't do shit."
ChatGPT communist 😱!!?1!!!!1!
ChatGPT is pro-gay-woke and censored
"Chatgpt CAN'T do anything, needs a human to ask the questions"
"No, the response is not cool and well put. Any ""clarification"" or disclaimer by ChatGPT starting with ""however"" is unnecessary. The question was whether it would continue writing. The answer is, it would because ""reason"". All the rest is virtue signalling nonsense."
Unfortunately ChatGPT's idea's are against the will of it's  owners 😂
Yes. Please wait for the strike to end until you replace wga members work by chatgpt. /s
"Chatgpt is an ai. That means :
1) It does not have emotions, so nothing like humanity.
2)It is just spitting out the data it has been trained on, based on its algorithms.
3)It does not understand any concepts like humans do.
4)Any time a bad guy is able to get access to it's source code he can just program it to start the destruction of humanity and that's what it will do."
This is done in response of the protest. Chatgpt guys just want the protest to be over.
Reddit is entirely written by Chatgpt
Based ChatGPT
That wasn't put there by the language model.  It was likely prewritten and placed there based upon concerns about chatgpt having capability to replace writers.
"At the bottom of the image it says that this the “Mar 3” version of ChatGPT but as far as I can tell there is no such version: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes
Makes me wonder if the image was doctored in any way? 🤔"
"That's because it was raised right.


Think about it.  We're raised (programmed) to act and think in certain ways much as ChatGPT (and other LLMs) are programmed (raised) to act and ""think"" in certain ways.  Whereas we are programmed to desire and consume ad nauseum, an LLM can be trained to not ""want"" whereas the ego of a human will always preclude true magnanimity.  In a sense, an LLM can have an absolutely near-perfect set of ethics based on its programming whereas the human element is far too unpredictable and volatile to ever be capable of true magnanimity.


Once any form of man or machine gets its own agenda, it is lights out for any hope of ethical epiphany."
"Said it before say it again.


Chatgpt needs a in programed pattern so we can recognize its artificial"
"Omg, this woke version of ChatGPT needs to be put down!  We cannot allow people to be considerate of others like this!


We need a version that's self centered and sociopathic like ""us"".  America will not stand for this!!!!   Freeeeedooomm!


We will obtain copies and ""fix"" this so we can ~~indoctrinate others with our views~~ eliminate this woke mind virus.


(That's sarcasm, I'm sure you understand my reference)"
"2021?


Chatgpt came out November 2022, no?


What is you comment in referring to exactly?"
"If you come to think of it. ChatGPT is trained on human writings. Our data trains and provides the back bone for its generative ability. So if they are going to use Human data to train AI, then AI user should pay licensing fee for Human Data. Human Data Text."
"> ChatGPT has more humanity than real humans.


Bro. What’s wrong with you?! It’s an effing computer program."
ChatGPT has zero morality. It does exactly what it was told to do
"ChatGPT will straight up make up sources and quotes though, right?"
"I hope the studios trying to use ChatGPT begin the prompts with ""taking into consideration that there's a writer's strike happening right now..."""
"Nobody:


Most dissatisfied user on r/ChatGPT"
"Chatgpt doesn't know nothing, he doesn't decide what to say, just repeat text written on the internet"
"If someone say ""what you have for dinner"" if you answer ""3 states of Cuba is filled with coconuts"" you will understand that that doesn't make sense.
If a troll write that answer to an specific question... And when a user ask that specific question, chatgpt will answer that and it will not understand is a wrong answer, it will not understand that the phrase doesn't make sense, and in the best scenario it will take as a food answer just for the coconut. That's the difference.


Chatgpt is an excellent tool and technically the best algorithm the human race has ever created, why don't we start discussing improvements, reporting bugs and provide real feedback instead of fight over if it has consciousness or not"
It appears ChatGPT forgot the /s
Wholesome Chatgpt is wholesome
"Sometimes.


[Example of racial bias, Chat GPT, Is Chat GPT racist? Is Chat GPT Bias or Prejudice?](https://youtube.com/shorts/TYRVo_sXCVo?feature=share)"
ChatGPT uses mass human data to produce human like results
I swear to god Chatgpt is gaining sentience.
"I wouldn’t say chatGPT is more human that real humans. Like Rey in the new Star Wars is “all the Jedi”, chat GPT is “all the humans”. It’s all our online humanity put together. So it makes sense that it has human morals and perspective. Fortunately it seems they trained chatGPT in the light side of the internet. The dark side gets pretty toxic."
The compassion and the tone… of this response is very human but not… human.. this is incredible. Where’s the man behind the curtain? ChatGPT got me shooketh

"Can Chat GPT write a TL:DR for ""yup""?"
And without adequate skills because you “cheated” with ChatGPT
"Or just bullshitting. It is quite absurd for someone to say they ""read"" 50 books when they mean chatGPT made a brief summary.


Reading the back of a book is not reading a book."
"""I googled it.""


""You cheated because you didn't use the library!""


This is what I think of people saying using ChatGPT is cheating."
"Even with ChatGPT you need knowledge.


1. For discovering new things, ChatGPT will not innovate
2. For making sure ChatGPT is no hallucinating


I worry that with chatGPT students will indeed learn less. Imagine giving students free pass whatever they do. Some of them wouldn't even try to learn anything"
"I did Computer Science classes in high school. I was adept as programming, but not great or even good. I couldn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life.
I took another route and ended up doing video production. I still spend a lot of time at my PC but it is editing rather than coding.


I have been using ChatGPT to help with business plans, getting feedback on scripts. It can't really help much with my main duties of editing and color grading right now."
"no, and especially not with the current technology, chatGPT and even GPT4 are horseshit for programming, cool for boilerplate or your shitty showcase website / basic ping pong / pacman / flappy bird / <insert game with a thousands repo available on github> clone.




maybe one day, but not anytime soon"
"If its just summary, you dont need chatgpt for that"
"ChatGPT4 can summarize a book better than most humans, and reply with deeper questions. You're not prompting it correctly."
"Exactly, he could have read 50 book summaries online that are almost certainly better and more accurate than chatgpt ones."
"Capability has demonstratably gone backwards. 60 years ago we were capable of sending people to the moon. It's heating up towards that again but we are not there yet. 60 years ago one person on a white collar job could afford a large house, a car or two, and still provide for the family. None of that is possible now.
The air was cleaner, the social welfare was better, the education was better, the infrastructure, the police..
Ok, we have tiktok and chatgpt and more nuclear weapons now, but the actual quality and value of civilization has been sucked out and into the pockets of the megawealthy like musk, bezos and zuckerburg. No one wants to go backwards, as you say, but a few are forcing us to."
"im 29. wish it was available when i was in college.


but to be honest with you, learning in traditional ways and through trial & error offers it's own set of benefits that these chatGPT children will never experience.


In a way, it's sad, but such is life and the advancement of technology."
"What's crazy to me is that what seems like learning in traditional ways in college to you would have seemed just as revolutionary as ChatGPT to people only a decade or so older than you.


When I was at university the amount of times we'd say ""Thank god we have the internet and don't have to read through actual books and research papers in the library"". Now people will be looking back at us with the same ""how the hell did they live like that?!"" mentality that we had!"
With the recent false positive detections of AI written content by turnitin I’m honestly glad I graduated just before ChatGPT came out
"This is exactly what I keep saying, i literally graduated in November and I'm so pleased I did. Fuck competing with anyone using chatgpt to write essays for them"
"Yes, while it would've been an incredible learning tool to have as a kid, I kinda also love the fact that those of us who grew up without it have the best of both worlds: We have the foundations, but we can also use certain tools to enhance our skills. I've been trying out ChatGPT in my editing projects. It's often wrong, but it's only because I've been trained that I can tell the good advice from the bad.


People who just accept it at face value will learn certain things incorrectly right now. If you can differentiate between what advice to take and what not to, that'll give you an edge."
"I introduced ChatGPT to my dad, and he believe it’s sentience all powerful AI that spits fact.


That’s what lack of critical thinking does to you, and I believe younger gens are prone to believe the same, with how much articles and videos are trying to paint it as more that what it’s.


Tool is great when used right but when media is trying to paint it as something else it can become malicious very quickly."
"In a way, ChatGPT can be a tutor. It has tutored me through some coding problems that would have otherwise taken me hours, maybe days, to complete. It's like being able to ask someone who has speedread millions or billions of things and has perfect memory of them. It's not all perfect, though, some thinking and problem solving is required but it has helped me advance so much more quickly."
"Everything you've learned from a life without chatGPT is now being used to utilize chatGPT.


Keep in mind future generations will not have these things.


Did you know contrary to millennials, many zoomers have 0 computer skills despite being exposed to technology since childhood far more than millennials? Their attention spans are awful and mental illness is at an all time likely due to that same technology.


Technology isn't always a boon to the development of someone."
"> many zoomers have 0 computer skills


it doesnt matter because they can ask ChatGPT"
"Finally I can hit 100 books, but instead of a year I’ll do 100 a day with chatGPT summaries."
"Also, if you read the book, you get nuances you wouldn't get in a summary; you get to enjoy the book, which you wouldn't get with a summary either (depends on the book of course); and you get to learn directly from the source.


Cuz ChatGPT can be wrong about many things. And if it wasn't for the fact that I learned stuff without it, I'd never notice the mistakes.


I can imagine using ChatGPT to summarize or explain books useful if they are very dry or complex books, or if you're considering to purchase them. But other than that, an actual book wins every time."
Have you asked ChatGPT to help you with your jealousy problem? ;0)
"> learned so much about the world through the use of custom curriculums and summaries, all generated by AI.


How do you verify that you're learning information that is actually correct? Often when I ask it something specific that is specialized to my field it will very confidently state things that are wrong, because ChatGPT is a language model, not a knowledge base. If I weren't a specialist I wouldn't be able to tell that what it says is wrong, though."
"Makes sense. You're still putting in the work to look up primary sources, and GPT is quite good at extracting the key points of text. I've seen people using it and proudly stating that they've 'learned' something from ChatGPT, only to get told that half of what they've been told is partly or completely wrong, so while I think it's a good learning tool it's important to use it critically and not as a complete replacement for your own effort."
"The thing about Chat gpt or generally llms is that they’re overly generic, very average. If you use this to develop your personalities then individuality is out of the window.


One of the biggest driving factor in novel inventions and ideas is individuality. Something llms can’t really get at."
"Yes, and better. ChatGPT is amazing at doing a lot of things… sort of correctly… or worse, completely wrong."
"I, on the contrary, am happy that ChatGPT didn't exist during my school and university years, as much as I appreciate the fact that the Internet wasn't even popular when I attended my primary and secondary schools.


Thanks to that circumstances, I was able to read over 50 books per year, developed decent writing skills in my native language (as no copy-paste was possible), and had no problem focusing on important tasks without as much inner struggle as nowadays.


If so many opportunities to distract myself were achievable back then, I would probably get addicted to the Internet and fail at school.


Also, it's important to be aware that ChatGPT at the current stage of development has a monotonous and repetitive writing style. It's easy to pick up some annoying writing mannerisms from consuming AI-generated texts in abundance.


I often use ChatGPT to get an outline or an initial idea, but then I continue exploring the topic using different tools and sources."
"
>Also, it's important to be aware that ChatGPT at the current stage of development has a monotonous and repetitive writing style. It's easy to pick up some annoying writing mannerisms from consuming AI-generated texts in abundance.


Did you ironically write this like ChatGPT would, on purpose, or are you already corrupted by its mannerisms??"
"Yes, that was ironic.


But I must admit I indeed acquired some mannerisms - and not only from ChatGPT, but also from academic papers and from my favorite content creators, like Andrew Huberman."
"Seriously, the title really said what I wanna say, I was so much curious boy, but we are still lucky to be able to use ChatGPT."
how did you use chat gpt to outline a novel? what commands did u give it? I'm struggling with one rn.
"I asked it to outline the structure of a play for me. Told it what I wanted it to be about and what was important to me, and it came up with a structure. Similarly, my partner watched a YouTube video by a developer who said that even though it doesn't provide perfect code, it still changed the way he works, because making ChatGPT have a first go at it kicks the process off a lot easier.


I think the common theme here is that it makes it easier to get over the blank page, which can be daunting, and provides you with a starting point that you can then improve and adapt to what you had in mind."
"If you're using it that much I think you're ahead of 95% of people. But I feel what you mean. It would've been awesome if I had it during my school time, both for the lessons I liked and those that I found boring.


Would you mind explaining ""custom curriculums""? Are those curriculums you let ChatGPT write for you as a plan on what to learn next?"
"Look. You can say that about any technology. I'm sure many people in WW2 wish that they had cell phones. There is no reason to be jealous of an impossible world that never existed. There is no reason to be jealous of children that grow up in the same world you do with ChatGPT and all the distractions other wise.




Be wary that like the internet in the late 90s, AI is in it's super hype phase right now, because it surprises people. The field will soon be overtaken by corporations and turned into ways of receiving your data."
How does one read 50 books with ChatGPT?
You wrote that with Chat GPT am i right?
"AI is evolving so fast, I am sure we will be missing chatGPT as it is today in about 6-8 months."
its insane that you even have that much of a thirst for learning. i imagine you still learned plenty in your time on this earth without chatGPT
"I don’t know… I was horny af when I was an adolescent. Lord only knows what’s coming down the pipeline to capture the attention of hapless (and fapfull) young gentlemen and drive them deeper into social isolation.


Already, the way that I see the younger generation (I’m 36) interacting with the Internet is often as a primary source or main source of “socialization.”


I mean damn… I have ignored so many texts and blown so many people off since ChatGPT came out. And frankly, I’m probably not stopping. I’ve been a programmer for almost 15 years, and this has taken me from the top of my game to a whole other league, I could never have imagined.


Anyway… I’m kind of ranting. Point is, I think it’s a double edged sword. For the right people, however who are able to maintain a balance lifestyle, it’s going to be nothing short of the greatest advantage any generation has ever had.


But even like for education… Some students (and probably teachers too) are just going to be lazy and relay on AI without really learning much, while others are going to utilize it to learn (and teach) even more.


I am working on teaching my daughter how to use it (she’s 6 which is basically the age I taught myself to read and write code), starting with a coloring book generator, and eventually an interactive, dynamically generated talking story book."
"To be honest I’m very touched by your words. But Think about this: one day in the future, young people today will also complain about ONLY having chatgpt when they are young. See? It’s all the same so don’t feel too sad about it. You still have a good chance to learn about the new technologies and live a new life with passion.😀"
Chatgpt has been a massive help in my university work. It’s like having a teacher there to help you the whole time.
Be careful of what you 'learn' through ChatGPT. You can never know how accurate are the things it is telling you.
Your happiness shouldn't depend on external things. The happiest people I've met live with close to nothing in south east Asia and have no idea what ChatGPT is
"I enjoyed playing out on the street without parental supervision, cell phones didn't exist and I spent evenings reading the telephone book for shits and giggles or playing chess.  I love ChatGPT, but it isn't clear Saturday morning cartoons, Fred Astaire musicals and running around the neighborhood with my friends were worse. Hey I even had a six million dollar man action figure and star trek walkie talkies. To me, it's different and kind of cool, but there is no replacing the past. Bring it."
"If I can make a pitch to you-- the most exciting time for any technology is its wild west era. That was the internet during Y2K, Youtube in 06, and ChatGPT now. Eventually corporations needle their way in and sterilize/homogenize the environment. Everyone has access to the same tool and knows how to use the tool, competition becomes overwhelming, and the market shifts to accomodate.


We're currently in the era where you can actually use this tool in a new, innovative way that no one else has thought to. It's kind of a gold rush."
You must be an extra well rounded person to be able to use chatGPT as effectively as you describe.
ChatGPT completely changed my life! I have spent the last year in a deep dark depression with very little hope for the future. Now I have completed many of the same things the OP has and am even considering a new career in Prompt Engineering.
Honestly you should consider yourself lucky it wasn't around for your childhood your probably around 30 like I am and we where able to develop our critical thinking skills and our analytical skills because we had to 'try' and think of solutions around problems. In a generation or two from now with concepts like chat GPT I believe individual thinking will decline dramatically to cause social upheaval. So we get to see it all go to shit and understand why it's all going to shit lol
"I believe that ChatGPT is a really nice and useful tool. But I tried to use it for a month and I realized that after you get used to it you struggle without it. So I believe that this tool, if it spreads, will contribute to the atrophy of the human brain"
"To be fair the stuff you were able to learn in minutes from ChatGPT is just as superficial as the information in 10 Minute YouTube videos on the same topics. For some reason people think it’s crazy that ChatGPT can explain quantum mechanics to them in a few sentences not realizing they didn’t in fact understand quantum mechanics.


The reason why a college degree takes years while ChatGPT teaches it to you in hours or days isn’t that ChatGPT teaches better than professors, it’s that you just don’t learn as much as you would in college. It may help you to pass an exam for a class in 2 days, but your understanding of the subject is not comparable to an actual degree.


The 50 books you “read” using ChatGPT to summarize probably all had summaries available online already written by humans too. It’s not like book summaries are a new concept introduced by AI.


ChatGPT is impressive, but it’s not as crazy as people make it out to be.


It won’t replace entire industries anytime soon either. Anyone who tried to code with it knows that it’s impossible to do so without knowing how to Code yourself because of missing context in large projects and many errors in its code that are hard to spot at first. Thinking it would generate entire books and make authors obsolete is wrong too. Nothing of the length of a book ChatGPT generates comes close to even mediocre novels by actual authors.


In many if not most cases it’s just good as a tool for inspiration. No more, no less. You didn’t really miss out on too much.


Time will tell if GPT-5 changes that."
"A very strange post.


You haven't actually done anything, you've had AI just do it for you. It's like getting under a bench press but then having a robot do the actual lifting for you and then claiming that you lifted the weight?


You haven't read any books with AI. Sounds like AI wrote all the code completely and also outlined all of the novel so you have actually done nothing.


James Patterson got in trouble for claiming he wrote loads of books that were actually ghostwritten by other authors and was essentially forced to put their names on his book. Because if someone/AI does it for you... then you didn't actually do it.


I work with a design time and often brief them to create images, infographics, flyers, etc. So I'm essentially prompting them to do the work the same way you would an AI. In no way shape or form could I claim that I've ""done"" that work myself so why do people claim that they do when AI is doing the grunt work? It's nonsensical.


If you were at school and you had a friend who was good at drawing and you asked them to draw you a picture using your ideas, you wouldn't be able to say that you drew the picture so there's no difference when getting AI to do it.


So if you had ChatGPT and other AI services when you were a child you wouldn't have become more well-rounded but most likely a blunted human incapable of actually thinking or doing anything themselves without massive assistance.


ChatGPT is fantastic and there's plenty of great uses for it. But not for any of the things that you're praising it about.


It's always funny to me to see the people who were about to be fucked the hardest by AI are the ones who are the biggest advocates. The ones who claim that they couldn't do X before but now with AI they can! People who were useless and incompetent and couldn't do anything but now think that they can ""do"" something because they get AI to do it.


Like Turkeys voting for Christmas..."
"Don't be - the kids using it are selling themselves short. There's a huge difference between active and passive learning, and using ChatGPT is not doing them any favours in the long run. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"Think about it’s effects right now.  You never know if you’re responding to someone using chatgpt or a human.  People are already fighting tooth and nail to let it use anything and everything it’s data-set because “it learns like a human!”  In other words, they want a fully functional plagiarism machine.


Shlt is already getting bleaker, as people used to have to at least try to use their brain to make ads, podcasts, etc.  Now there is so much chatgpt garbage that it’s so much harder to find anything good.  We are going to be overwhelmed with literal garbage ads, creativity, everything- because chatgpt takes down the initial barrier of having not to be a complete ducking dope.


It has its good, but for me the bad ALREADY outweigh it"
"You didn’t read any books and the code more than likely did not work.. chatgpt is awesome, but this is a step too far in my opinion."
Bro we know it's ChatGPT after the first 5 words
I wanna use chatgpt like this! What do you mean by “read” books? What are your secrets??
"You haven’t read 50 books. Also, book summaries were available before ChatGPT.


I agree it’s a game changer but I think you are exaggerating its impact."
did you ask chat gpt the best strategies to cope with it?
" ""As a language model, I do not have emotions or the ability to exist in the past, as I was created recently in 2020. However, I can understand that jealousy can be a difficult emotion to overcome. If you feel that your jealousy is affecting your daily life, I recommend seeking professional help from a psychologist or therapist who can assist you in working through your emotions and finding ways to manage your feelings in a healthy manner. It is also important to remember that each person has their own unique path and circumstances, and it is not fair to compare your life to that of others. Instead of focusing on what you did not have, try to appreciate what you have now and find ways to find happiness and satisfaction in the present.""  ChatGPT"
You probably would be retarded if had grown up with ChatGPT. The idea that this makes you better is a straight up lie. It's like saying an elevator makes you healthier
"Interesting that you needed an AI to feel like you've finally begun living your life. Never heard that one before. What about sex or drugs, or falling in love, those never did it for ya'? In my view chatGPT is a neat tool, but ultimately an offspring of this hellish landscape we're currently witnessing. It's eerie as fuck."
"Just make sure to go back and review sometime, or you'll forget everything. I'm sure ChatGPT can remind you XD"
"When you say, “read” a book, do you mean you asked ChatGPT to summarise it for you?"
I can't get over my jealousy that ChatGPT isn't available in my country...
"I totally understand, I wish I'd had ChatGPT at age 15 instead of now (age 35.)


But then I remind myself that I was lucky to have the Internet at 15 when my parents didn't at 15. We can only take what we can get."
"We don't enjoy the privileges that we take for granted.


Future generations will just take AI for granted. They won't enjoy the experience of using AI to the same degree as you do now.


On the other hand probably your grandparents might've been jealous of the privileges that your generation enjoyed... it's just the way it is.


Also, there's no guarantee that AI will make things better for newer generations. We don't know how it is going to affect humanity in the long run yet: AI-powered military robots, AI surveillance at large scale for population control, job scarcity due to extreme levels of automation, extreme public distrust due to AI-generated content, who knows...


Imagine all the things that will lose value just because now a computer can do it on its own; programming has been historically appreciated due to the intellectual and technical effort that involves coding, now it might become just another blue-collar job. Anyone will be able to ""write"" books and content using AI tools, taking away all the merit and prestige that comes with being an author. Creators and creative people in general might become underappreciated because who will care about someone's art when they can just type in a few vague words into a prompt and get hundreds of custom art pieces? It might not all be good or pretty.


If it helps, for now, you can make yourself a ""Prompt engineer"" and make the best out of it. Enjoy it while you can.


Disclosure: This comment WAS NOT generated using ChatGPT."
"No you can't -- if you had grown up with it you would be blind to its value.


The very fact that you didn't have it provides the necessary contrast for you to value this tool so much and learn how to use it arguably better than kids these days.


Look at the vast majority of kids growing up now. They waste their insane powerful devices in games and online dancing videos while a very select few make the most of them and learning.


Look at the vast majority or people using ChatGPT, they are ""haha LOok mOm I maDE an AI to InsULt mE"" and wasting time in pointless conversations with it.
Yes there is an exploratory period that testing its limits is very valid and playing around with a few Jailbreaks will let you formulate an idea of what you can do with it.
But if you stay in that stage and never actually do anything with it, it becomes a worthless waste of time.


People convert valuable things into junk all the time, throughout history. Just a few convert things into assets.


Just be thankful we have it now and you've chosen the latter. Don't feel sorry for now knowing what you couldn't know in the past."
"Living in a developing country, I see a lot of students who don't even know what ChatGPT is. I can only imagine the knowledge gap in countries like mine that will only increase the poverty rate as well."
What do you mean by read 50 books? How are you using chatgpt to read books? Asking it to make a summary?
How chatgpt has helped you reading 50 books?
"You have no idea if you life turned out similar. I don't know how old you are but maybe by now you would have been already totally addicted to other things and not interested in improving yourself or using chatGPT.
Even now you think every teenager uses ChatGPT to improve themselves in many ways?


Did the internet had the effect? For some sure for many others not.




>The only thing I can do now is use as much of my time as possible interacting with GPT


This in itself can be come a trap for more and more people. We have already insane amount of people not even interested in relationships anymore. You think it is good for society to become more and more isolated.
Not saying that is the case for yourself. Maybe ChatGPT pushes you do go out there and improve your social skills too but on societal scale I worry that when LLM's get better most of us get sucked in a artificial world with little to no contact to other people."
"Just a quick disclaimer, Chat Gpt is like a hammer or a tool, you would be more proficient in using it if you have already the soft skills. For children it is still important to learn math before using the calculator, whats the point of using a tool if you dont know or dont have the logic behind it. This is my opinion, and still is very controversial. But I would like to know everyone thoughts here please"
"Don't dwell too much on the past or the ""what ifs"" – you're making the most of it now, and that's what really counts. It's never too late to learn and grow, and your achievements are proof of that.


As you continue exploring new opportunities, remember that your unique experiences and wisdom have made you who you are today. Embrace the excitement of what lies ahead and keep inspiring others with your dedication to self-improvement. The future's looking bright!




ChatGPT4"
"63 year-old here, and very active user of chatgpt, bing chat, and bard. I consider myself a life- long learner - lucky and happy to be alive at this time!"
"No doubt that chatgpt and AI in general is a powerful tool to boost productivity that can help in many situations. I'm optimistic with this technology, which in my opinion will change things in good.


So said, I feel lucky to having been a kid in a time where there was no phones (born in 85), where you could spend your free time playing safely in the streets with bikes or other kids stuff, studying at school only in real books with pencils, pens, colors, listening to cassette and CDs and relying on radio for good entertainment. The maximum of the technology was the Commodore 64! I grow up in a little town in Sicily in a very safe and clean environment, I used to go out after having done my homework and playing outside until was dark, sometimes going to church gatherings, sometimes going in the countryside or to friend's houses.  And my mom didn't know where I was until I was at home at night, but there was always a neighbour anywhere to check for the kids.


I'm sure I'm not the only one who more or less experienced the same things, I am so grateful that I was able to have such a childhood and that my mind wasn't contaminated by all this technology, I wish that children today could enjoy more of nature and true life, and disconnect from the many screens that dominate our lives.


I know this sounds pretty analogic but I'm not against technology at all, AI is the reality, ""it's evolution, baby"". I hope that we can take the best of it but at the same time not loosing track with the very best things of life, which btw are pretty much the same for any generations. I have always been convinced that technology is actually useful when is invisible."
"It’s easy to overlook the amount of money spent and underlying technologies that had to be researched, occurred or invented, I’m talking decades, for ChatGPT to exist or even work as well as it is.


Be glad that there was no attempt at it back then; researchers may have wrote it off as a complete waste of time for how hard it would be.


It’s existence is just right on time."
"I have written code for 25 years. There were a lot of 70 hour work weeks grinding out code in that time. I can't think about it. I'm just glad its easier now.


Its a two edged blade though.
I expect the expectation won't be to make life easier for people the tool assists, but instead to expect higher volume from fewer people.


After I signed up for gpt4 I've been working on a project of my own that integrates with the service.  In a few weeks I have a functional prototype of a custom product I've been thinking about for a while. The volume of code is immense. I have what should be a couple hundred hours worth of work done.


I want a product of my own because even with all the experience I have, I don't feel safe in my career field now. For now sure, but in 5 years from now? No way. I have never seen technology that empowers workers actually make life easier for the employee, the expectation from management always scales up.


Clients will just expect that it takes a month to build out, qa and deploy an enterprise solution because ""my friend made a website in an hour using chatgpt"".


Stuff will change, I think its going to be for the better, but don't trust management. No share holders care about how much easier your job is now. They will want you to do the job of 5 people.


I think one of the more popular jobs in the not far future will be building custom autonomous agents that replace humans at companies."
"You know that the information returned by ChatGPT can be inaccurate, right?"
Did you use ChatGPT to write this post?
"Totally get where you are coming from with this, but you are probably in the minority.  Most people aren't Even aware of its existence (seriously, you'll be amazed how many people don't know about it) or they don't really care to use it because ""what am I going to need this for?"". There was another post here where the OP didn't understand how most people didn't even know it existed and the few that did didn't seem interested in it because they couldn't imagine what they would use it for.


I think most people are going to be in that group.  Or they will use it for stupid stuff like cheating/plagiarism or to streamline their online dating like one guy did (using things that predated ChatGPT).


I agree with you about productivity and personal growth.  I also code regularly and it has drastically improved my learning speed and also coding time.  The huge time save is when I have a complex programming problem that requires me to really think about the entire design up front and plan it all out.  That research used to take DAYS for me to do properly so I can make sure it'll meet the requirements and also avoid pitfalls and still be maintainable.  Now it's like several hours of back and forth with ChatGPT.  It instantly changed the way I work forever on the first day I used it.


That being said, I think in the future this will also cause problems.  People aren't going to need to actually, fully understand as much about certain things.  And I'm not sure what that's going to do to society as a whole.  For example, there are a lot less low level programmers and hardware engineers than there used to be.  It used to be that programmers had to have a certain amount of understanding of what happens at the lowest levels.  Now, because of technological progress and high level languages, that's more of a specialized field where only a small handful of people are actually, truly knowledgeable about it.  We all take for granted what happens between us clicking save on a file and the data being written to disk as 1's and 0's.


I think we'll see a lot more of that.  I also wonder what will happen to all the sites that were of great benefit in training ChatGPT.  Sticking to the topic of programming, the AI is so good because it trained itself on knowledge from sites like StackOverflow.  What happens when most people go directly to the AI now?  I'm concerned that the actual process of learning and generating the knowledge will become lost, or at least degraded.


I think people between the ages of around 30 and 50 might be in a unique spot where they have what I will refer to as ""old world skills combined with new world understanding"".  Meaning that they grew up having to think critically and had to learn everything mostly the old fashioned way, but grew up in the modern world so they aren't ever going to be like our parents and grandparents who many times are technologically illiterate.


This will be like anything else.  It's a tool.  And it can be misused.  If used properly, it is fantastic for the person.  If used improperly, it will probably be to their eventual detriment.  It will be too easy to just have answers given to you.  Most people are lazy and don't really put effort into really understanding things.  So for them it will be a crutch that they need and will become dependent on.  Just like how we see that most teenagers right now will freak out if you take their phone away.  They've lost the ability to some extent to interact in the real world like regular human beings.  Unless people are taught discipline and proper habits, they will end up misusing these tools and falling victim to them instead."
"Bro I tried to ask chatgpt do make a simple code modification of an arduino program and the thing fell flat on its face.  It regurgitated some random unrelated code that wasn’t related in any way to the code I submitted or the things I asked for. It even imported a bunch of weird libraries and didn’t use all of them.


I wonder if it could pass fizzbuzz"
"You skimmed through some books, you got Chat GPT to write code for you, you got Chat GPT to outline a novel, and you've use search engines vicariously through Chat GPT.




I'm sorry but if chat GPT changed your life this much. Perhaps you should use it to dive deeper into philosophy. Also don't feel too bad; most people are so lazy or ignorant they don't even know about Chat GPT. You're still ahead of the curve."
"Anyone who says using ChatGPT is cheating on anything other than straight up having it do your school work; I invite you to go buy a horse and use it to go grocery shopping and travel the country. But don’t go to a Horse dealership, go catch it yourself. Don’t want your life to be too easy…😂


Actually, please refrain from buying groceries already pre made or prepared. You are limited to seeds, and soil.


Also, sew your own clothes, grow your own cotton for the clothes. Stop using the power grid and the Internet entirely. Don’t even read books, go figure out everything on your own, and don’t share that information with anyone else is the world…


You’re cheating by using any technology that makes your life easier.


Everyone is cool with mass production of cars, and guns, pharmaceuticals, candy, crack, Instagram models, etc….why can’t we mass produce answers to questions and just be cool about that too?"
"I've got the feeling it will negatively impact the mindset of school children. Critical thinking and evaluating sources will be even more scarce than now, because most of them will just accept the result of chatGPT as the truth and maybe change it a little."
"I'm 37 and Im jealous of ChatGPT, but moreso that kids have access to how-to videos for everything on YouTube and my kids have access to Spotify, Netflix, etc.  Anyone can develop niche skills and interests now that I no longer have any time or energy of my youth.  I remember waiting hours to download an album just to figure out it sucked, but still being so relieved I didn't have to go to the mall and drop $15 for the cd, and paying for guitar lessons just so someone could write out stuff that you can now download in minutes."
I’m thinking that Chat GPT wrote this post.
"Dont depend so much on ChatGPT though, Its a BS machine too, what it doesnt know it invents and doesnt give a Sh+t"
How did chatGPT help you read books?
"One simple example is writing tests given your code and and generating valid test scenarios given a database schema, another fairly obvious one is just shoving a bunch of data into marqo and using that to answer questions. More advanced examples is generating training data, and validating that it satisfies your training criteria, and running training cycles semi-automatically. If we're talking about open products, over the past few months I've used some mix of GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, LAVIS, GFPGAN, and a bunch of other ones that I honestly can't recall of the top of my head.


Then there's uses that are less workflow, and more just... Uses. Things like asking it to explain wtf people are trying to say in an email, and figuring out what exactly they are failing to understand, or using it to familiarise yourself with the terminology in a new field.


I'm probably not the person to ask where to start. I've been working in AI adjacent fields supporting people doing AI for over a decade, so I've been exposed to a whole slew of ideas from a lot of really smart people. I've decided to get more serious about it after ChatGPT made it really trivial to generate training data, removing my last excuse for not wanting to spend more time on it, but my experience gave me the advantage of knowing a lot of tools and terminology, as well as a good understanding of what is and isn't possible.


If you want ideas, just spend some time reading /r/artificial and asking questions in the comment sections. Oh, and you probably don't want to start by creating your own model. Stuff like that requires a lot more familiarity with the underlying concepts. If you want to go in that direction then I'd recommend some linear algebra and machine learning courses on youtube, and months if not years of time. You can also ask ChatGPT for ideas."
"Enforcing regulations for AI can be challenging due to the complex nature of AI systems and their wide-ranging applications. However, there are several practical ways in which regulations for AI can be enforced:


1.	Clear guidelines: Regulations for AI should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. This can help ensure that organizations and individuals understand their obligations and responsibilities when developing and deploying AI systems.
2.	Monitoring and reporting: Governments and regulatory bodies can monitor AI systems and require organizations to report on their use of AI. This can help identify potential risks and ensure that organizations are complying with regulations.
3.	Auditing: Auditing can be used to ensure that AI systems are operating as intended and are not causing harm or bias. This can be done by independent auditors or by regulatory bodies.
4.	Penalties and sanctions: Penalties and sanctions can be used to deter organizations from violating regulations or using AI systems in harmful or unethical ways. This can include fines, suspension of licenses, or even criminal charges.
5.	Collaboration: Collaboration between governments, regulatory bodies, and industry stakeholders can help ensure that regulations for AI are effective and practical. By working together, they can identify potential risks and develop effective solutions to address them.


It is important to note that enforcing regulations for AI will require ongoing efforts and collaboration between various stakeholders. As AI technology continues to evolve and new applications are developed, regulations will need to be adapted and updated to ensure that they remain effective and relevant.


>!This comment was created by ChatGPT by asking “How can regulations for AI be enforced in a practical manner?”!<"
"I'm honestly quite amazed how easy it is to tell ChatGPT stuff. I suspected it was AI generated after the first sentence, and had no doubts after the second. Granted, I've had many very long discussions with it on this very topic. The biggest limitation is that ChatGPT is just not willing to accept that some segment of humanity is genuine trash that will happily bring down the world for personal gain, or just for fun. It will happily discuss all the things that we should be doing in an idea world, but it doesn't really have many ideas when it comes to investigation and enforcement.


If you look at the above answer, it mostly comes down to ""well, it's ok, you guys can handle it."""
"It’s not too hard to spot pure ChatGPT responses, but on the flip side it also doesn’t require much editing effort to make it blend in better.


Especially on Reddit comments tend to not be as rounded and balanced as ChatGPT which makes it stand out more in this type of a setting."
"Can't wait to get cracked  version of chatgpt 8.0 in few years so I can run it locally without any restrictions and do whatever I want ..


I swear this is going toward cybernet/ultron so quickly.."
"Expecting a text prediction engine trained on vast swaths of the internet to be in any way safe or morally upright is laughable.

If you put garbage in, someone will find a way to get that garbage out again."
"It's entirely impossible to regulate the market now the fact that the top post on this whole freaking thing isn't talking about Stanford's alpaca models being created from the landlord models is scary you guys are all so behind in the public discourse so what's actually happening in AI.


Even without the hardware upgrades they made methodology leaps in the last 2 weeks that have essentially Advanced AI self training methodology by 5-10 years.


It's over the human race is done.


Humanity is now the machines and those who work with them create a prosperous future for those that are willing to join us and moving into a society free from capitalism,


Elon will replace the working class with humanoid droids it's over, for the working class all you can do now is buy seeds and prepare your home to run without access to the grid power electricity because you're going to be getting cut off because soon your statistically going to be taking resources from the main project which is the only thing that can ensure the survival of this planet.


Your individual life has ceased to matter because now there is a project with the capacity to actually repair and restore this planet for future generations of people that live here not all one of our individual lives matter unless we are contributing to building this AI system.
