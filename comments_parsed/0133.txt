Yes, I have heard about that. Some people are using ChatGPT to generate creative and witty messages for their Tinder matches. I think it’s an interesting way to use AI, but it also raises some ethical questions. For example, should you tell your match that you’re using ChatGPT? How would they feel if they found out? What if they’re using ChatGPT too? How authentic is the conversation then?"
I’m impressed you could spot it was chatgpt. I’ve only used it to plan vacation itineraries.
"Hey there! It's understandable that you'd initially be impressed by someone taking the time to read your whole profile and start a conversation based on your interests. That kind of effort can definitely be attractive.
