You have this backwards. The default position, given what we know, *should* be that causal determinism is true, unless *evidence* shows otherwise. All of our understanding of physics is embedded in causation being universally consistent, which seems to be true. This doesn’t mean that **hard** determinism is necessarily the case, as it could be that some behaviours of elementary particles are random, but the default assumption must be that causal determinism is true (note: “randomness” here means that information isn’t possible to access, or doesn’t exist at all—a property that can only be ascribed when *all else is ruled out*).
