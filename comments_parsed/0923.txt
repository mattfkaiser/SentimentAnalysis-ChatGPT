"It’s a predictive model that has been trained on a large portion of all the text humans have written. It has a trillion parameters. It’s a black box. Calling it ”just” anything or claiming that you understand it because you know the basic algorithms behind it is reductive to the point of being borderline misinformation - especially when we have articles like this https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712 that actually go deeper to test it. The conclusions from that article are worth considering.
