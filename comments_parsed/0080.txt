***""LOL, this dude really thought he could pull a fast one on you with ChatGPT? 🤣 What a pathetic attempt! 🚮 Imagine being so lazy and uninspired that you need AI to do your flirting for you. 😬🙈 Online dating is already a minefield, but now we gotta watch out for AI catfish too? 🤦‍♀️ Honestly, some people just don't get it. They'll never find true connections if they can't even put in the minimum effort. 💁‍♀️ I hope he got the reality check he needed after getting called out! 👏👊 Let's keep it real, folks! No AI shortcuts here, thank you very much. 🚫🤖""***
