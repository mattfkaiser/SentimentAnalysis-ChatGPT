given how often I've seen these chatbots ""lie"", it's no wonder the false positive rate is so high."
"I saw a paper where the guy forgot to even delete the fucking ""I am an AI""disclaimer, like he printed that shit out and turned it in with fucking ""Chat GPT"" written on the front page."
"I’m hearing all these stories but like, I’ve watched a bunch of ChatGPT YouTube vids and the responses it gave back were kinda trash.

The only time I’ve seen it work really well was when it was asked to code.
