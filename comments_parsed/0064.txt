I love using ChatGPT for drunk text messaging. Bluntly tell it what you want to say, and ChatGPT articulates it for you. I typically have to iterate a few times so it lands somewhere between sounding like a bitch and sounding like a moron. It's hilarious when you tell chatGPT to make you not sound like such a bitch. Its correction goes full highschool Chad with slight brain damage.
