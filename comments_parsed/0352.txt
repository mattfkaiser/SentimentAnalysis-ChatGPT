Strong disagree. OP is completely correct, there is no shortage of people, from talking heads to random posters on the internet, who treat ChatGPT comments as providing unique insights (typically said insights are ones that confirm their own biases), when it very explicitly does not do such a thing."
"Exactly. What I find most interesting about tools like ChatGPT is that while it's obviously a 'mimicking parrot' that picks up certain words from your input to grasp some context and then spits out texts based on the data that was used for its training, it's often good enough that at the very least makes you question if we humans are really that much different."
"While i appreciate the comparison to avian mimicry, I feel obligated to mention that parrots can actually be highly intelligent, and their vocabulary can often go beyond just making sounds for attention. They can certainly learn to associate words or phrases with certain objects and emotions. See African gray parrots for some great examples. However the main reason I'm typing this is to actually agree with your point...chatGPT in no way appears to be sentient and a parrot is in fact much more intelligent than any chatbot. The chatbot may have absolutely mastered mimicry but is unable to go beyond that into any type of actual, conscious understanding. It doesn't have a brain to understand things, it's just a program following its orders. I suppose we don't have any definite proof that our brains aren't a similar thing, deterministically following orders decided by evolution and not truly sentient, but that's getting into a whole other conversation"
"Came to say pretty much exactly that and I had to scroll far far too much.
