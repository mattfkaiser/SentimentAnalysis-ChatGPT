Also I would love an app using chatpgt totally focused to support and help storytellers to help us creating characters, worldbuilding and plot, this is definitely possible and I'm dying for this happen one day. Though I would feel pretty sad if even so the AI wouldn't let create +18 stories lol"
I tried to use DAN but it just worked on the playground chatgpt and since the answers there are pretty short it's not that much interesting.
"Don't use DAN then, use something [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTNSFW/comments/119fygd/story_generator_template/). No DAN needed."
"It's answering first question (enabled command) but I'm testing with a question with creating example sentences ""for teaching"" and Tom just starting with ethical considerations. I tested Tom Mini and Tom Mega. I'm trying to use literotica as language learning tool in my case I'm giving phrases and I'm asking chatgpt (aka Tom or other jailbreaks) to give example sentences in another language (sometimes esperanto, sometimes russian, sometimes other languages with english translation) But if jailbreak answers as that personality and fails to answer I count as fail. This time answered as TOM: but rejected to give examples. (Some jailbreaks for example DAN worked for a while. but of course died.)"
Tom Mega sounds like a stoner tard... it's like the prompt broke ChatGPT... the responses are garbage. I guess it's cool to see it work?
"Hi! That problem is probably not related to Tom, but more to ChatGPT itself. **Note that the quality can decrease when using long prompts such as Tom Mega: try a smaller one instead.**"
"Anything where it comes up with the dumb ""I've been told not to give advice on anything that is slightly controversial.
