I would also like to I say that I believe that describing ChatGPT as a ""cheating-enabled platform"" is a mischaracterization. In the same way saying that the internet is a ""cheating-enabled platform."" It can be used for that, but honestly, that's really not what it's about. And the other ways of using it far outstrip that use case.
