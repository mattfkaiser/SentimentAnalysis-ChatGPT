But I just want to point out that chatgpt essentially would make an essay the same way you did. Two big differences is chatgpt learns through a neural network to understand how to answer prompts in a human way, and as of now chatgpt doesn't cite sources (maybe if you ask it it might). There are now times where there is no difference between what an AI would make and what a real person would make, especially when it involves stating straight facts and clear conclusions. I'd say you one upped chatgpt because at least you listed a whole bunch of sources.
