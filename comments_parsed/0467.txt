The thing is, the latter of these two hypotheses has not been observed. We frankly don’t know what that would even look like. How exactly does an emergent property work? How do you describe it mathematically? What does that look like in a human brain? Do we have evidence that this actually *is* happening in the brain? Right now, consciousness as an emergent property is only a hypothesis. That doesn’t mean it isn’t true, but it is not the default model.
