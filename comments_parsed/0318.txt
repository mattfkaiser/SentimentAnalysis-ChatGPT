As an expert googler, I have a feeling I may use ChatGPT tools some but I personally prefer having a huge array of links to choose from and to peruse multiple sources to gain a deep understanding. I wouldn't trust an AI chatbot to give me a good answer on something complex. I also had a coworker send me a script he had ChatGPT write and it didn't make any sense and I solved the problem myself in like 20 minutes of google, with less code."
"Exactly. I haven't used ChatGPT, but I'm curious to try it code examples, but half the effort in coding is the intention and unique approach to each solution. Code is highly contextual and there is rarely a ""one size fits all"" answer. ChatGPT could be supplemental, but it's the human element that is clutch, at least for my ability to truly understand what I am writing."
"It's funny because  I have the exact opposite opinion in terms of the example (stack overflow)... I wonder how often I have a run across a SO post that doesn't explain anything, and/or has a hidden or unclear secondary effect, and/or has flat out mistakes (or is even just flat out wrong!). Whereas ChatGPT will almost always spend a ton of time just explaining everything in the code samples it gives you, which solves everything I put above (on average). Like I've had it give me bad code, but because it clearly explained what the code was doing, all I had to do was provide it clearer context on what I needed."
"Also, ChatGPT is never snarky when you ask for clarification."
