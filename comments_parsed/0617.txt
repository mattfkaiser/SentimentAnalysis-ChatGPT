On the other hand, in real life, I actually have had decent success. Met my partner at a retreat, through a friend. I think I’m more successful in these environments because they essentially are a massive filter for people similar to me. If they’re at these types of events, are friends with my friends, share a common interest, values, cultures, they are much more likely to be a match than a randomly chosen individual.
