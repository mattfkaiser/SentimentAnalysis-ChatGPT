It would be nice to catch them cheating, and I'm curious on how exactly they do it. Probably just a cellphone in the lap. But to fail them, I don't need it."

"ChatGPT is a language model, it's main purpose is to sound natural. It has no concept of ""facts"" and any time it happens to say something true is purely coincidental, due to a correlation between statements that sound true and things that are true. Which is why anyone relying on it to tell them facts is incredibly misinformed.
