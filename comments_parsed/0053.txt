A:
As an AI language model, I don't have a physical presence, and I don't interact with people on Tinder or any other dating app. It's important to be honest and transparent with the person you're talking to, so you should clarify that you are not ChatGPT and explain who you are. It's possible that the misunderstanding could be a harmless mistake, but it's best to clear things up sooner rather than later.
