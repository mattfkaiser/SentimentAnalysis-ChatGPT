One thing I will say..  your lack of punctuation in your comments here make it look suspicious that you wouldn't normally write like ChatGPT.  However, maybe you don't write to your lecturers like that."
"I teach, and I think it's pretty obvious when chatgpt is used... chatgpt has a very specific style of writing that is also often clearly distinct from the previous writing style or ability of the student. Frankly I would only use whatever stupid AI-checking tools in order to have some kind of ""outside"" evidence of cheating. The real evidence is just reading the paper."
"Bring any brainstorming, older drafts that your printed, any proof of work you did. Bring references, show where you found them. Bring other papers from before ChatGPT was released to compare.
