People are overestimating the usage of AI, forgetting about the clear fault of it and that it is by no means a new field. Asking Chatgpt 4 to do basic dbms theory and it will give you the wrong answer like 50% of the time, and if you don’t know the answer you’ll assume it’s correct. Asking it to do a chrome extension that scrapes a few tables and does some calculation, and it will start creating code with bugs, once informed of those bugs it will start making more and more redundant code until you tell it exactly the bug and how to fix it. Point being there are so many different ways to interpret things, and while AI has clear applications as a digital support tool, it won’t be replacing anything other than really mundane work or copywriting."
