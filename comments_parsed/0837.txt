I wrote a lot of papers for my undergrad and graduate degrees and I always hated using TurnItIn. It just didn't seem like a great way to check anything and I was always afraid of being falsely flagged. I can't imagine going to school in the age of ChatGPT.

I can truly empathize with the concerns and apprehensions surrounding the verification process on r/askdocs. It's important for everyone to feel confident in the credibility of the platform. In my own experience on a previous account, I am a doctor, but I too recognize the potential for the verification process to be insufficient. I wholeheartedly share /u/Nouyame's concerns about the possibility of someone getting verified without actually being a doctor.
