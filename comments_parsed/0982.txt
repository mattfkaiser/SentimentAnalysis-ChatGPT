They had run my paper through some software and that software told them it was generated by ChatGPT which it was not. I firmly assured them that I had written it myself, but my professors always responded to me that ""The program says something different"" or ""If it wasn't generated by ChatGPT then it must have been some other AI"" and that ""Those programs are foolproof at detecting AI"". There was nothing, and I mean NOTHING I could do to defend myself against these accusations.
