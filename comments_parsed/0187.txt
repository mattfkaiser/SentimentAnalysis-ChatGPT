I personally am in the same boat you're in, except I wasn't smart enough to use chatgpt lol I just fibbed it myself."
Just don’t use ChatGPT with your girlfriend. Once you get women involved it ruins everything.
"I was wondering this too, typing the question and waiting for a ChatGPT response isn’t quick, this must have seemed odd on a zoom call?"
"They probably had the interview on one part of the screen and ChatGPT on another part. Depending on OP’s cognitive abilities (some people definitely would not be able to do this), it’s possible he would quickly skim through the answers and then spit what he remembered back out. If he did this quickly enough, it wouldn’t look suspicious imo, it would just look like he’s taking time to think."
"Easy, he didn’t do it at all and this is just AI fan fic. You can’t read answers back word for word from ChatGPT and not sound like you are reading from a script. This is an obvious fake post."
"Can’t believe people are buying this load of bs. It’s virtually impossible to type out a question as you listen and read the AI’s response -all smoothly with no hesitation and 0 delay. With as sophisticated as ChatGPT is, even it wouldn’t be able to give you an answer off the cuff that’s tailored to your needs. This could only happen if you were being interviewed by a baboon. Even then, let’s say by some crazy miracle this actually did happen which I’m sure it didn’t, I highly doubt such a candidate would even make it past the onboarding."
"Agree, if you could do once, you can do your job with the help of ChatGPT as well! Take this offer and congratulations!"
Maybe this could have been avoided if they used ChatGPT like OP…
"Dude, your employer would replace you with ChatGPT in an instant if they thought they could possibly get away with it so don't ever feel bad for leveling the playing field.
