I haven't seen most people reacting to ChatGPT like it's a brilliant know-it-all. Everyone I've seen around these parts is doing the typical Reddit thing of falling all over themselves to make sure everyone knows that *they* know ChatGPT is just a mimicry of knowledge. Redditors love to be the Louis CK of forced mental masturbation that no one asked for.
