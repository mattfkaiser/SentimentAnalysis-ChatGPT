The other day, I was thinking that robots would inherently be unable to have empathy towards humans. Robots could not relate their ‘life’ experience to that of a human’s so at best they could only sympathize with humans. But then I thought, you could have a robot that experiences human empathy, but the stipulation would have to be that the robot itself identifies as a human. The robot would have to be tricked into believing it is a human and given a simulated human experience. In that scenario we could have a robot that experiences empathy, it just wouldn’t be aware that it is an empathy robot. So if we have a robot that has a mind meant to replicate a human’s in complexity and function, and the robot is taught to believe it is human, would that robot understand human language, or is it still just mimicking? And then let me propose this to you:
If empathy robots are a known thing that exist, it would only make it more difficult to trick an intelligent robot into believing it is a human, so I think the optimal time to simulate reality for an empathy robot would be like right now. So how can you be certain that you yourself are not an empathy robot that was tricked into believing you are a human? Would that change your perspective on robot intelligence? Because for all you know, your entire experience is that of a complex robot. Statistically, it is just as likely that we are simulated by a robot as it is likely that we aren’t (50/50 split)."
While i agree with the sentiment. The exciting part of chatgpt is not what it is but the potential of what it may become.
