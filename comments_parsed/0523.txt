I am a software developer with about 30 years of experience. I've never seen a technology move so fast. During my time on the bench at the consulting firm I worked for from January to April, I devoted the vast majority of my time delving into the topic of AI, LLMs, and ChatGPT in particular. I'm preparing myself for the new role that's about to emerge. AI Integrator. Someone with a background in systems development who understands the basic workings of AI and the tools coming onto the market well enough to help clients integrate it into existing and new offerings. If you thought the changes wrought by the internet were huge, you ain't seen nothing yet.
