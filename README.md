<p># SentimentAnalysis-ChatGPT

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of reddit comments that mention ChatGPT. It searches for comments
containing specific keywords, and then uses the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on those comments.

The results are stored in a CSV file with the original comments, comment ID, polarity score and sentiment
category (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).
