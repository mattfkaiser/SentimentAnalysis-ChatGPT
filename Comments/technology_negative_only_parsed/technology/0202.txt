75% is a tad strong with GPT3.5/4, but I can see some CEO's doing it, regretting it immensely, then stepping it back after they realize they still need people to carry out these tasks 50-80% of the time.

ChatGPT is just to 2023 what Google was to 1998. Jobs will be lost over it just like back then. The difference here is, ChatGPT 5/6 and up, and its competitors. Will progress stall, or will we see the same gains we saw from traditional keyword search -> ChatGPT? If it's the latter, it's scary.
