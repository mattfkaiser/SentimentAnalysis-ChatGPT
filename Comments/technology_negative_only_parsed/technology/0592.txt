If people thought it was an Idiocracy now, oh manâ€¦.just wait until an entire generation of kids that â€œChatGPTâ€™dâ€ their way through school starts to get into the workforce.  The morons are beating at the door.  

People really need to start thinking long and hard about the technology they unleash on the general public.  Just because something can be done, that doesnâ€™t mean it should be done. 

This thing is gonna have such disastrous consequences for humanity.  People truly donâ€™t understand.  If you thought social media ruined the world, believe me, you havenâ€™t seen shit yet.
