It seems absurd to you because you can't answer it without acknowledging that your original argument simplified the situation to "human did nothing, AI wrote entire thing" which everyone would agree could be a little irritating, but when you read the article, isn't actually true.

But you've jumped straight down the slippery slope to a horrible and outrageous world of humans not caring and robots being the only ones writing heartfelt messages.

You know and I know that nobody would have known ChatGPT was used here if the author hadn't tried to do the right thing and credit the usage of it. 

Again, all this article and your outrage is doing is incentivising people to lie about their use of AI, which creates a significantly worse and more dangerous world.
