Headline, clickbait, misses the the point. From the article:

â€œThat students instinctively employ high technology to avoid learning is â€œa sign that the educational system is failing.â€ If it â€œhas no appeal to students, doesnâ€™t interest them, doesnâ€™t challenge them, doesnâ€™t make them want to learn, theyâ€™ll find ways out,â€ just as he himself did when he borrowed a friendâ€™s notes to pass a dull college chemistry class without attending it back in 1945.â€

ChatGPT isnâ€™t the fucking problem. A broken ass education system is the problem and Chomsky is correct. The education system is super fucking broken.
