Is Wordâ€™s grammar and spelling tool also plagiarism? 

The thing about ChatGPT is that it isnâ€™t plagiarism. Because itâ€™s the content is generated by the userâ€™s prompt. Itâ€™s not copied from Wikipedia or a book. Thereâ€™s no author that is being plagiarized. Itâ€™s not copying from published worked. So the definition of plagiarism doesnâ€™t take this into account and needs to be updated.
