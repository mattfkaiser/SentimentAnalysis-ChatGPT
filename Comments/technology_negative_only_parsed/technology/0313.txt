I remember when my middle school librarian literally yelled at us for not doing a good enough job memorizing the Dewey Decimal System because it was the only way we would ever be able to look up information by a topic. I also remember when schools fought against using Selectric typewriters with built in correction tape because it made students more lazy about preventing typing mistakes with it being too easy to correct them. 

Every new innovation is met with fear. The old ways are safe and predictable. But most new innovations are simply tools to be used for good and bad. Our moral compass will always be the deciding factor on that, no matter how many types of things we try to ban or regulate. 

I'm not saying no regulation is the way to go, or that ChatGPT won't help some students cheat. What I'm saying is that when I forgot to memorize my Dewey Decimal System and knew I was going to fail, I wrote them on the insides of my fingers as a 10 year old and miraculously passed the test. And felt ashamed for doing it. And decided I didn't want to succeed that way. 

ChatGPT is a new tool. But it is no smarter or better than what we can code it to be. So maybe it will eventually change the way we test a student's mastery of specific skills or knowledge, but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.
