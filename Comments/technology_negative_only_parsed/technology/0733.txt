Alternatively/additionally you can make the brainstorming and planning components part of the assessment, and deduct marks if the final paper veers significantly from what was planned. 

I know theoretically a student could get ChatGPT to produce the paper, then reverse engineer it into a brainstorm+ plan but in my experience there's no way the kind of student who would use ChatGPT would have the foresight and be willing to put in the effort to do so.
