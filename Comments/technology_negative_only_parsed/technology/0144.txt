Or _reckless disregard for the truth_.

You don't just get to publish lies about people and then claim "nuh-uh the computer did it".

The matter at hand here is whether the reckless disregard for the truth was from _OpenAI, by making ChatGPT available_, or by anyone who publishes ChatGPT content without extensive fact-checking.

As Fred Riehl never published the content, the lawsuit is going after OpenAI, trying to prove that the former scenario applies.

And even that's not frivolous. Building a lying-machine whose design purpose is to be _as convincing a liar as possible_ and then marketing it as "AI", is certainly ethically dubious. Integrating such a tool into search engines is just idiotic.

Whether that crosses the line into defamation itself, is for a judge to decide.
