Google has much more to worry about than that, OpenAI could replace most of the features that are offered by Google. Right now, they are known for ChatGPT, in the future they could have AI based maps, a much better email service, cloud services that can automatically organize your files to perfection, and more. If they got big enough, they could even replace Amazon, all of these companies are worried because they see the potential of what OpenAI could become. 

The only thing is that they are partnered with Microsoft, which makes sense as they need funding due to the high cost of cloud computing, but could possibly set them back in the long term. I'm not sure how much control they have over OpenAI, but in my experience, Microsoft seems to have gotten worse as they increased in size, so I wouldn't want to be tied to them.
