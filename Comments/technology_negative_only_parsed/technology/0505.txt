ever since chatgpt was released it really made me hate reddit and the internet. People take all â€œinformationâ€ at face value, make shit up from their own opinions and spew it as fact, and gobble up other peopleâ€™s shit. Itâ€™s insane. 

ChatGPT talks nice but using it extensively for programming advice itâ€™s made so many mistakes that Iâ€™d rather search for good answers on stack overflow.
