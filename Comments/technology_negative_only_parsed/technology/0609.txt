In ChatGPT's current state I'm not sure that any work you can successfully cheat on it with is really worth doing. There's no real depth to a lot of it's answers and to coax out more detailed answers you kind of need to know what you are talking about anyway.

There's also some danger to denying students the access to play around with and experience chatGPT and similar AI technologies. Not developing these skills and experiences will only further the inability for people to recognize things like fake news, deep fakes, and develop the proper skepticism to live in and survive in a world where AI can generate almost all of the media content.

A lot of the citizenry already lag behind in this regard and fail to ID articles and other content that were very clearly generated by a machine and was designed only to attract a click. These bots will only get better and I don't see how preventing students from interacting with it will help prepare them for that kind of future.
