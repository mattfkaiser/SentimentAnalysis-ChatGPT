Then youâ€™re using the tool wrong.

Everybody keeps blaming ChatGPT for â€œwrongâ€ answers. Itâ€™s not supposed to give â€œrightâ€ answers. Itâ€™s not a knowledge engine or encyclopedic database. People need to stop using it as one.

Whatâ€™s correct differs from source to source anyway.  Who would even decide whatâ€™s correct and whatâ€™s not, and how would they do it?

ChatGPT works exceedingly well when you know what to use it for and how to do so.
