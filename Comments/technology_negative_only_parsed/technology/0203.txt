The rest of big tech are not ready to compete; they want to hamper the competition before they lose more market share. That and ChatGPT 3.5/4 are already â€œenoughâ€ to displace a LOT of people, but whatâ€™s most concerning is not their current potential but future potential. How quickly will ChatGPT 5/6 advance?

I never thought that Google would be replaced despite it being more common in tech. If google canâ€™t compete in the next few years, a decade later they may not be what they once were.
