Current low level lecturer at my uni who has been following chatbots for several years now. Iâ€™ve previously warned about the issue but was shut down on the grounds that they â€œare not good at writingâ€. Now that this has all hit the mainstream, the uni is holding a weeklong workshop/lecture series to â€œfigure it outâ€.

I asked our departmentâ€™s most senior professor (whoâ€™s in their 70s) if they were worried. Their response: â€œhahaha, no. Iâ€™ll just make everyone hand write their twenty page assignments in class and ban the use of technology in most cases.â€ They clearly felt smug that they had somehow trumped ChatGPT in one fell swoop. 

We are going to see a lot of this. Professors who think they know better using no evidence to make their units exponentially worse for students and preventing meaningful engagement with a tool that will likely play a major role in most future professions (whether we want it to or not). This article is full of terrible ideasâ€¦ especially the prof who said they would just mark everyone a grade lower. 

Iâ€™ve just updated one of my units so we will be using ChatGPT throughout the whole semester. Looking forward to when the tenure profs accuse me of teaching the students how to cheat their poorly designed units.
