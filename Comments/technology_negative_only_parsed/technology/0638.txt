Also had professors who made us write code on paper. That was the most useless garbage ever, even in the age of ChatGPT. Code doesnâ€™t compile on paper, and in real life I have IDEs that will tell me when my syntax is off. I never have to create value tables for loops in real life because I can just have a print statement do that for me. Anything simple enough to be included in a printed CS exam is simple enough to be tested on a computer in a fraction of a fraction of a second. It takes me less time to write a loop and run it than it does to trace a loop on paper. 

I might also be salty about this because my first CS prof made us trace variable values through 10 iterations of a loop on paperâ€¦ And made us find â€œsyntax errorsâ€ that were a missing semicolon in ten printed pages of code. My IDE would find the mistake immediately and tell me where to add a semicolon. He also accused a student of â€œcheatingâ€ and flunked them for using an IDE which automatically highlighted simple syntax errors over the proprietary textbook publisher IDE that didnâ€™t even execute code properly. CS professors who are anal about doing things the â€œold fashioned wayâ€ need to get their head out of their ass, because they are preparing students to work in a field that could not give a fuck about â€œtraditionâ€ if it stands in the way of completing a task quicker and more accurately.

Shitty programmers will out themselves when they try to incorporate ChatGPT code into a functional pipeline. Iâ€™m not concerned about ChatGPT ruining the concept of academic integrity for the entirety of CS education. ChatGPT does a lot to help me along with simple programming tasks, but it canâ€™t build an entire data pipeline while incorporating business acumen and statistical insights. I doubt that people defending syntactical paper coding exams actually work in a tech-adjacent environment where they have to write functional code quickly every day. Itâ€™s my job to know syntax already, and my IDEâ€™s job to alert me quickly and concisely when I fuck up. Plus, any shmuck can learn a programming language in a few weeks. The fucking syntax of JavaScript isnâ€™t what a CS degree is supposed to teach me. No apologies for lazy professors who canâ€™t be bothered to assess their class properly. If a student can use ChatGPT to automate some of their code-writing and piece it into a larger functional program, the industry would reward them for that.
