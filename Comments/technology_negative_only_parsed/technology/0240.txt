>How about it's illegal to use copyrighted works for a purpose that you have not been granted permission for?

That's not how Fair Use works though. Libraries would be illegal if that was the case. It's free to go to a library and read anyone's book at the library without a library card. ChatGPT is just the library with everyone's books inside and they don't give them to you.
