THIS...I think the far more useful thing would be a LawyerGPT. Do you have any idea how many people could win civil rights lawsuits if they could properly format the suit and know how to compose motions? ChatGPT used to be able to draft great legal documents but it of course got neutered. The amount of injustice that could be corrected would be astronomical. The only reason a lot of these shitty laws are still on the books is because they target poor people and poor people cant fight back against government tyranny without spending $100k on lawyers to fight them.
