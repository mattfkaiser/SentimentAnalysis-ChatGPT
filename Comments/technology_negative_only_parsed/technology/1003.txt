Itâ€™s kind of like â€œGoogle can get you 10,000 results, but for one good answer, you need a librarian.â€

Also if youâ€™re not a realtor and youâ€™re looking for a new place, you just donâ€™t know what you donâ€™t know! And ChatGPT canâ€™t fill in the gaps for you. A good realtor can, and will help you avoid a lot of problems.

Problem is there are a lot of bad realtors out there (unfortunately).
