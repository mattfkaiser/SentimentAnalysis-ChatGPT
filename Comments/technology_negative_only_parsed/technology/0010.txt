Same with the medical profession. I'm a physician and asked it for some information with sources from a specific journal, which it gave me. When I tried to look them up, I couldn't find them. When I asked chat GPT about this, it basically said, "whoops, those articles don't actually exist!" Which is scary on one hand, but also frustrating, because it would be nice to have real sources I could look up and read myself for more information.
