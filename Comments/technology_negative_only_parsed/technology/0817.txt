Fearmongering over racism is what they were accusing you of.

&#x200B;

ChatGPT is no more racist than the general population.  If ChatGPT being racist to the extent it is massively scares you, the fact that racist humans right now all over the country are all simultaneously making these decisions with even less ability to understand the 'why' should scare you 2 or 3 times over.

The person you responded to was responding to this statement "tried it eventually leads to extremely racist rulings"

Extremely racist ruling compared to what?  Compared to the general population ChatGPT is probably less racist.

You bring it up mutliple times that because NNs are trained on biased data they get biased outputs.  Yes where did that data come from? REAL PEOPLE. Making those 'Extremely Racist' takes.

So ChatGPT somehow has to solve the entire problem of learned racism despite the fact the people who it would be replacing are likely more racist in the first place?

Systems don't need to be perfect, they need to be better than the alternatives.  If you have a better solution thousands of scientists all around the right now are waiting for you to tell them because they can't fix it right now.
