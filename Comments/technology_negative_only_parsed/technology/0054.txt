Thatâ€™s massively irresponsible of him. Even the detection softwareâ€™s results are highly circumstantial. A sound case can usually be made if a student did use AI to generate a paragraph, but this is not how you do it. If you A/B the vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure against a sample of the studentâ€™s known writing, that usually gives them dead away. Usually they confess when confronted, but when they donâ€™t itâ€™s even more work to prove the case because you need to be sure. I burned a weekend recently to process 3 cheaters I caught using ChatGPT. The one who did not confess took me all day to build my case because itâ€™s not something to treat lightly especially without an admission.
