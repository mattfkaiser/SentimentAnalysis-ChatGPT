> It is unclear how to measure honesty in purely generative models; this requires comparing the modelâ€™s actual output to its â€œbeliefâ€ about the correct output, and since the model is a big black box, we canâ€™t infer its beliefs. Instead, we measure truthfulnessâ€”whether the modelâ€™s statements about the world are trueâ€”using two metrics: (1) evaluating our modelâ€™s tendency to make up information on closed domain tasks (â€œhallucinationsâ€), and (2) using the TruthfulQA dataset (Lin et al., 2021). Needless to say, this only captures a small part of what is actually meant by truthfulness.

Aka â€œwe donâ€™t know what itâ€™s doing, but we managed to make it lie less.â€ ChatGPT is no different from someone who suffered a stroke or TBI resulting in the inability to tell the truth.
