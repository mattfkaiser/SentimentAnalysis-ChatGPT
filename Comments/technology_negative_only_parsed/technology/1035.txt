In all honesty - and how I've used the tool a bunch as of late - ChatGPT is *fantastic* at organizing data and helping you brainstorm on talking points.

I had to do a presentation for work recently, and fed in some of the information I wanted to touch on.  The AI recommended some other points I should probably mention, and helped write out a bulletpoint list of how the presentation should look - going as far as recommending the subject and talking points on each slide.

It was probably the best presentation I've given in years.

Did it write out the entire presentation?  No.  But it sure as hell did quite a lot of the heavy lifting that I usually find to be a pain in the ass when it comes to building out presentations.
