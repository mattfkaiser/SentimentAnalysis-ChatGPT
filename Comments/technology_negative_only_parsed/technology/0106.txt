My wife is a lecturer and she agrees with all your points. She is using it to create lesson plans and help with various other admin tasks but there's no worry about students abusing it.

She also mentioned that after a very short amount of time she learns her students writing style so it would likely be obvious if something wasn't written by them. Her other observation is that chatgpt has no critical thinking skills and a lot of what she grades on involves that to some extent so her view is that if someone uses it they'll likely get a pass at best.

No sleep lost here.
