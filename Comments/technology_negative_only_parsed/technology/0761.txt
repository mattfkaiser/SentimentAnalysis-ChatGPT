>You fail to realize

First off, pretty arrogant assumption in my opinion. I'm aware of what ChatGPT is, and I have no doubt that the tech will improve. I started this thread by saying I thought it was possible, just that actual novel thought is a far cry from what is being done today. There's a lot of lay people who don't understand that sounding human and thinking human are two very different things. 

There's a lot of discussion and debate right now about whether **any** amount of training can ever produce the kind of thinking that humans do. I happen to think that one or two more breakthroughs will be needed along with continued advancements in our current direction before we actually see the kind of AI that is doing more than next-word prediction.
