All the â€˜bullshit generatorsâ€™ seeing their work being replaced by ChatGPT ðŸ˜‚.

This is true, if you do real work or hard engineering thats very difficult / impossible to replace.

If your job / contributions are based on BS, exaggerations, asking others to do stuff for you or how to do thing your tasked withâ€¦chatGPT will absolutely be taking your job.
