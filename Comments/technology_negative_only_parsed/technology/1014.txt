See you and all the other contrarians in here have misunderstood my very point. You have taken "capitalists will ruin the economy by being complete and total morons overhyping an unproven tech" to mean "this unproven tech is no good/fake/pointless"

eg Uber's spent the past decade telling its investors they're "one year away" from self-driving cars to separate VCs from their cash. Does this mean a self-driving car is pointless? No, it means capitalists should never ever be believed until they can prove what they're claiming.

I've said it before in here I'll say it again, we are probably 18 months away from hundreds of companies, each with their own "AI" promising fabulously otherworldly powers, and billions upon billions of dollars will be pouring into the industry, only for a piddling percent to be legit. One day, the market will look around, see a thousand "AI" companies doing absolutely nothing, and it will cause a crash.

At the heart of it will be chatbots similar to ChatGPT, which is a bullshit generator telling the inputter what they want to hear, tricking people into what they want to hear, to separate VCs from their cash.
