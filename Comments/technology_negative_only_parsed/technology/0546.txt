I would argue that people consuming content has not changed, what changes is the kickback (0 exposure 0 money as you said) that the original content creator gets because ChatGPT doesnâ€™t cite itâ€™s sources.

And once the problem in the feedback loop is correctly reframed as â€œcontent creators not getting recognitionâ€ rather than â€œpeople not consuming contentâ€, then we can see that itâ€™s an age old problem and not a new one created by the advent of ChatGPT.
