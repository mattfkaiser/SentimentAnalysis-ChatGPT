You know the strange thing about chatGPT? It's obvious the way it writes. Back in uni I was a tutor and a TA and it pads papers the exact same way a shitty student would. I mean, it makes sense, it was trained on a lot of essays, I can't imagine that most of them are of quality. Just noise sent out into the aether so people could keep surviving.   


Halfway though the first sentence I knew it was chatGPT. It's got it's own unique flavor of mediocrity. Especially that conclusion. Ick. Even if you can't write an algorithm to detect it, any halfway conscious educator should be able to smell it a mile away.
