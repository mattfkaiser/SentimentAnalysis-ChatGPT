Yeah, and ChatGPT has 175 billion parameters, each of which acts as a weight, so whenever the model outputs a token, that's 175 billion multiplications. And each digit is (probably?) a separate token, so for ten digits of output, that's probably over a trillion multiplications done just to give you the wrong answer to a single multiplication problem...
