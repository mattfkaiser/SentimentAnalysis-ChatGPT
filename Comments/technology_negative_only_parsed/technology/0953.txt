so in different words they might store it and later use it as a "plagiarism check tool" where you can reverse check a document to see if it was produced by ChatGPT? But it doesn't look that reliable, if I'm going to cheat on a project I will just generate some text using ChatGPT and just transcribe it in my own words/style, impossible to detect imo (but I'm not a programmer). Unless I solve a problem with a completely wrong solution, while giving it completely unnatural explanation as it already happened in few cases.
