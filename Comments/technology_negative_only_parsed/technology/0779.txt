...no that's a normal-ish chatbot they made.  I would be willing to bet that was one of the excuses execs made, but the major reason was because it wasn't remotely ready for launch in a cohesive manner.  

Consider that they started this in 2018, left Google over it in 2021, and ChatGPT became a huge hit a little over a year after they left Google with their "AI" but the rate of interest spiked about[ a month *after* ChatGPT became popular.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=Character.Ai&hl=en)  

So no, fuck off with this tabloid nonsense.
