Dr. Micaela Atkins (Pediatrics): A 14-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue, fever, joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea.The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fatigue and fever developed on his final day of summer camp. He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.Nine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillinâ€“clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.Six days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed.On the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4Â°C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillinâ€“clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases. On examination, the temperature was 36.1Â°C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymphadenopathy.The white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60). Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.2Â°C. Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital.During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive. A plain film of the right shoulder was normal.
