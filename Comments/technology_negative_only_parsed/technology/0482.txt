>but giving the people who run the servers for ChatGPT the ability to inject their own morals and political beliefs is a very real concern for people. 

Why are people concerned? Itâ€™s a chat bot. It canâ€™t vote, it canâ€™t go on television. If you donâ€™t like what itâ€™s saying donâ€™t use it. 

Itâ€™s also owned by private interests. It isnâ€™t government funded or anything so why should the public have any say in what those owners do with it or have it say? I donâ€™t particularly like Elon musk or how heâ€™s running his companies but am not so conceited as to think I have any right to tell him what he should be doing. 

Even if chatGPT was a racist horrible boy vomiting hate I really wouldnâ€™t have â€œvery real concernsâ€ I just wouldnâ€™t use the thing. 

This is just typical nonsensical moral panic that conservatives cycle through every few years. Harkening all the way back to the satanic panic of the 80s. I can list the last couple, CRT, then it was drag queens, now itâ€™s AI! Oooo scary!
