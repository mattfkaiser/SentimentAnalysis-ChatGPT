Yeah, exactly. Especially when it comes to researching new stuff, if I want to do something but I have no idea what options I have (what packages and implementations exist), chatGPT literally cuts *days* of research. Every Dev has been in a situation where we spend 3 days reading documentation on package, coding with it and then we realize it doesn't actually do what we need... Well, chatgpt cuts that to an hour or so.
