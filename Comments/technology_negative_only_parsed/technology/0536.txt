Iâ€™ve done this. I needed a script for a Google doc that would update a time stamp to the header whenever the document is edited. Like Updated on: date & time by: user. Google docs doesnâ€™t have the onEdit trigger like sheets does so I was totally lost on how to code it so I asked ChatGPT. It gave me something that I thought would work. Got an error message. Tried again and another error. I did that for an hour until I realized there was no simple way of coding this functionality and even though ChatGPT knows this it doesnâ€™t say it, it just makes up functions that donâ€™t exist to solve the problem. I know enough to know why it wasnâ€™t working, but if I knew less then Iâ€™d be really confused about why I kept getting error messages. 

I never did sort it out, I think the best option is to use the revision history of the doc but Iâ€™m really not sure how to do that since I think it needs to be accessed through the Google drive data and not the individual doc
