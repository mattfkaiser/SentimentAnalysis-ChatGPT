Yeah, the more I see generated chat GPT messages and learn about it, the more I think the media duped us. It was initially too hyped up and this is barely AI. Its just a fancy program to take a large data set and try to create a small summary of a few things that seem to have a pattern. Using the bing search doesn't feel like AI, it feels like the same snippings of info google puts at the top of the search page. Just takes longer typing it out.
