Lololol. I was having a fun conversation over discord with some friends and asked ChatGPT to give me a paragraph length insult but written in Old English. It lectured me about the negativity of insulting people. After several more requests insinuating I was writing a book or something, it reluctantly gave me what I was asking for. It can be done.
