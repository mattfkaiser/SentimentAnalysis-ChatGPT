Itâ€™s not there yet but I for one am really excited for the day where I can still down on a Sunday morning and just be like â€œyou know what I wanna read a thousand page story about a galactic war between between a pirate vampire and a necromancer werewolf. Throw in some cybernetic banshees too why the fuck not.â€ And get a great book to read no matter how shit or dumb my idea is.

â€œChatGPT a 1000 page dark post apocalypse about fruit and vegetables becoming sentient and growing limbs after our efforts to genetically modified them went too far.â€
