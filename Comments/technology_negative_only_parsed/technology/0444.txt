Teacher here. I've taught every general course from age 12 to high school senior. Yup, every course.\* Yup, grade 7 - 12.

It's not hard to adapt to ChatGPT. You simply ask students to explain their essays. I always do this per round of essays. In fact, I think it's bad form to grade or comment on an essay without the student present to explain his / her thinking.

10-15 minute interviews, 1 per student. We read the essay together and we discuss how the writing went. It takes about three classes worth of time (with 90 minute blocks) with a bit spilling into lunch hour (if you submitted your essay late, you get assigned the lunch hour interview). Students who are not currently in an interview are reading through the next unit's material. I don't give feedback on essays outside of interviews because teenagers ignore written comments.

\* Only notable exceptions: Biology and Visual Art. Otherwise you'd have to find a pretty esoteric course to find one I haven't taught. I've taught all maths, English LA, English Writing, English second language, History, Geography, Psychology, Economics, Government, Philosophy, Physics / Chemistry, Music, Drama, Technology, Health & Fitness and I'm probably missing some.
