Stack overflow has been in a death spiral for years, and chatGPT likely has very little to do with it. 

Their overwhelmingly shitty toxic attitudes of senior members, and the fact they don't purge old results, and new questions constantly be closed as duplicates of 15 year old questions whose answers aren't accurate anymore. 

I'd be willing to bet they are loosing more traffic to reddit than to chatGPT.
