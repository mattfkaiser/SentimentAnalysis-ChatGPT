ChatGPT is a trillion dollar lawsuit in the making. If any data landed on the servers that is considered covered under regulation frameworks (GDPR, California Privacy Act etc), the company owning that data need to provide privacy guarantees which Iâ€™m unsure how will be achieved. You can also feed poison data to ChatGPT like someone elseâ€™s SSN, driver license, etc. 

As always pros and cons.
