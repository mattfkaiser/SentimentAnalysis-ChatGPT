All I see on Reddit and Youtube is just excessive levels of hype and people under some delusion that utopia is upon us because of ChatGPT, it's just corporate tech hype we see again and again.  
And every time I see actual effect ai is having it's all negative, things like misinformation, stealing and scamming in art etc.

 Like recently there was a professor who had the ai spew a bunch of nonsense about him being a sexual predator, when in reality he had been the one to call it out and brought attention to it.  
And because people take what ChatGPT says as gospel people ended up believing he was a sex pest.  


 People just believe everything ChatGPT tells them uncritically, I don't think people realize how much bullshit it's spewing.  
This isn't even getting into the copyright issues and how when websites tried to use it to write articles it just ended in blatant plagiarism.  


 The only positive things I hear about it is from completely random Redditors that never actually give any actual evidence, they just make huge claims about all these great things they're doing with it.  
And then every time I see something real that I can confirm is true it's all negative or underwhelming as hell.  
   
 I really don't believe that this is as revolutionary as people are making it out to be, it's a glorified guessing software.
