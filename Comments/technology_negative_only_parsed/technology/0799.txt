>After months of sounding the alarm about students using AI apps that can churn out essays and assignments, teachers are getting AI technology of their own. On April 4, Turnitin is activating the software I tested for some 10,700 secondary and higher-educational institutions, assigning â€œgenerated by AIâ€ scores and sentence-by-sentence analysis to student work. It joins a handful of other free detectors already online. For many teachers Iâ€™ve been hearing from, AI detection offers a weapon to deter a 21st-century form of cheating.

>But AI alone wonâ€™t solve the problem AI created. The flag on a portion of Goetzâ€™s essay was an outlier, but shows detectors can sometimes get it wrong â€” with potentially disastrous consequences for students. Detectors are being introduced before theyâ€™ve been widely vetted, yet AI tech is moving so fast, any tool is likely already out of date.

>Itâ€™s a pivotal moment for educators: Ignore AI and cheating could go rampant. Yet even Turnitinâ€™s executives tell me that treating AI purely as the enemy of education makes about as much sense in the long run as trying to ban calculators.
>
>Ahead of Turnitinâ€™s launch this week, the company says 2 percent of customers have asked it not to display the AI writing score on student work. That includes a "significant majorityâ€ of universities in the United Kingdom, according to UCISA, a professional body for digital educators.
>
>To see whatâ€™s at stake, I asked Turnitin for early access to its software. Five high school students, including Goetz, volunteered to help me test it by creating 16 samples of real, AI-fabricated and mixed-source essays to run past Turnitinâ€™s detector.
>
>The result? It got over half of them at least partly wrong. Turnitin accurately identified six of the 16 â€” but failed on three, including a flag on 8 percent of Goetzâ€™s original essay. And Iâ€™d give it only partial credit on the remaining seven, where it was directionally correct but misidentified some portion of ChatGPT-generated or mixed-source writing.

>Turnitin also says its scores should be treated as an indication, not an accusation. Still, will millions of teachers understand they should treat AI scores as anything other than fact? After my conversations with the company, it added a caution flag to its score that reads, â€œPercentage may not indicate cheating. Review required.â€

>Unlike accusations of plagiarism, AI cheating has no source document to reference as proof. â€œThis leaves the door open for teacher bias to creep in,â€ says Dell.

>For students, that makes the prospect of being accused of AI cheating especially scary. â€œThere is no way to prove that you didnâ€™t cheat unless your teacher knows your writing style, or trusts you as a student,â€ says Goetz.

Without proper and rigorous rules around how and when these systems are deployed live in educational settings, there exists a high likelihood of deeply problematic results that might have long lasting consequences for certain students. Unfortunately, many institutions and systems currently lack the capacity to both understand the technology and also develop appropriate rules around their usage. A pause in this rollout would be prudent, but also unlikely.
