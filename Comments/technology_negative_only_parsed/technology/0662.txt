For the record; as an ex-teacher myself I fully agree. Although I think that lecturing more wonâ€™t be enough to address the paradigm shift brought by LLMs. 

The problem here is that the education system has been becoming more and more invasive in the personal lives of students. By that I mean assigning more and more homework. Since thereâ€™s only 8 hours in a school day, there has been attempts from admins to try to get more productivity and education out of students by â€œextendingâ€ the day more and more with homework. This is why the homework that your average middle schooler comes home with daily is much more than it used to be, and the problem has only been getting worse. 

ChatGPT nukes this paradigm from orbit. And because so much homework has shifted online, that makes it that much easier for using ChatGPT to cheat. 

Ideally, this should give admins a chance to reconsider their direction and focus more on engaging educational tools, classwork, in-class education, and testing instead of over-reliance on homework. But they will always try everything that doesnâ€™t work first before they finally do the right thing. Itâ€™s a lot easier for a system to double-down on what theyâ€™re already doing than it is for them to fundamentally change their approach to an issue, we call this Systemic Velocity. Because of Systemic Velocity, we will probably see more homework, attempts to ban ChatGPT in schools, or PSAs to parents about ChatGPT. 

For the record, I do think this will eventually kill homework in primary school. Either ChatGPT or an even more advanced model. There will be hemming and hawing, but admins and education policy experts will eventually adjust to this reality.
