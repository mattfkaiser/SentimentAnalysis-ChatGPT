I absolutely agree with this, people will rationalize their perception of ChatGPT being a tool to cheat, because they feel cheated since they had to do a lot of those things themselves and manually.

But just like how the calculator was invented, we no longer had to manually do the work required to do simple mathematics.

And what did parents and teachers say back when the calculator was invented? They also deemed it a tool for cheating, because "nobody is gonna have a calculator in their pocket at all times" well, we know what happened now.
