>There is plenty of evidence and talk about how Google search is becoming less useful and other options are growing in the search scene (including ChatGPT). 

Do you think advertisers want to put ads on a chatbot that could say anything? Advertisers don't care if the user experience is better. They care about performance and the potential damage to their brand. They do not like a chatbot you can't explain how it arrives at the answers. ChatGPT costs 30c USD to generate a response. That isn't a profitable business model. 

>YouTube is getting ever more heavy with ads and less and less something people want to use.  YouTube is still huge but they are opting to make the experience worse which will slowly drive users away.

And what competitors do they have? Vimeo. It is very expensive to serve video. Google has billions of dollars of dark fibre. That makes it viable for them.

>Then Google wants to disable ad blockers which only serves to drive more people away from their system.  They are making short term decisions to boost their numbers but will bite them in the ass down the road.

Wonder if they've spend over a decade locking in users.

>Google seems to be standing still with no answers.  They are on the decline.  Seems to happen when you get a lot of middle-managers each trying to hit their numbers for the quarter.

They're making billions every quarter. They're not going to grow 20% YOY but they own the majority of advertising on the internet.
