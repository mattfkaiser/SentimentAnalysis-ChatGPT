ChatGPT invents sources - theyâ€™re not real. I checked this out in-depth with some ChatGPT results for my subfield of science and in all the examples I looked at, I found that ChatGPT had made up real-sounding article titles from (interestingly) actually-real journals, but if I went to that journal site to try to find the actual article, it turned out there were no articles with those titles. All the â€œsourcesâ€ were fake. I believe ChatGPT is just mimicking what citations look like, without actually drawing on real sources.
