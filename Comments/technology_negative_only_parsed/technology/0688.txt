Have you actually done this? Because I just did. The search page itself tells you nothing, just links. The first four links are sponsored links, one of which is behind a pay wall. If you scroll past the ads to an actual â€œcuratedâ€ result, youâ€™re sent to a page that forced you to scroll through a wall of crappy filler text while being bombarded by pop up ads. Itâ€™s a nightmare. 

Now ask ChatGPT to give you ten good options for dinner for someone who likes pasta but wants something a little different. Youâ€™ll get a useful result. Now ask Google, and youâ€™re cast into a sea of useless crap.
