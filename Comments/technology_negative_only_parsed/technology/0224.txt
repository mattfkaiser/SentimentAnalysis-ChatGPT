Stack Overflow was fucking groundbreaking. It replaced a shitshow of disparate forums with answers buried deep into threads spread across multiple pages with next to no searchability. In its early years it was where coders went _before_ Google, instead of only going there when you couldnâ€™t find an answer on Google. It grew, it had issues, and it adapted, sometimes poorly. My problem with it now is itâ€™s become more like the forums it replacedâ€”itâ€™s hard to find a _current_ answer. Answers from 10 years ago still show up, but are wrong our outdated. I think now itâ€™ll be â€œquick google, ChatGPT if itâ€™s more complicated, maybe back to google, stack overflow if I have toâ€.
