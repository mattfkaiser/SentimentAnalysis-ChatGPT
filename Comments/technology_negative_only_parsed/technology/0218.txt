you're right. for example i asked chatGPT a simple question to create a regex to split up ID, name, code and quantity of a product from a string and it took it tinkering the question more than 20 times. 

Sometimes it was not splitting up name and code from each other. or when it was telling me that this code gives this output, real output was just an error.

it could be the case that i was wrong, but i doubt.
