It's such a huge contrast between the things ChatGPT can do, and how useless Google search now is even when only compared to itself from 5-10 years ago.  ChatGPT can write you a whole essay just off one or two prompts, while Google seemingly can't understand a simple question.  

I don't know why Google seemingly prioritises results that do not answer your query but it's become just horrendously frustrating.
