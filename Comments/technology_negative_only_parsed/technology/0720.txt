I had a similar experience this week. I needed to do some spreadsheet magic trying to split the contents of one cell into a piece of example code in another. I'm not well versed in coding or spreadsheets at all. Spend some time finding a formula for it using Google without success. Then i explained my problem in ChatGPT and it very confidently gave me a formula that should do what i asked. It didn't actually work, but the base was 70% there and in a direction i had not thought of before. Took me another 15 minutes of tweaking to make it actually work. It really helped the process.
