Schools just need to adapt to chatgpt. Teach students how to use it to do research, how to ask questions to get more accurate answers, how to get it to format things correctly, how to check and make sure it doesnâ€™t give you wrong information, how to organize and compile it into an essay, how to take a one sentence fact and give a better explanation of it, etc.

Ai isnâ€™t going away and schools canâ€™t just ignore it. Remember back in the day when teachers used to tell you that you wouldnâ€™t always be walking around with a calculator in your pocket so you couldnâ€™t use it on the assignment? Thatâ€™s basically what youâ€™re saying with describing assignments that would avoid chatgpt instead of working with it
