ChatGPT is decent at summarizing things and giving reasoned arguments, but it is not capable of giving sources and providing real quotes that you can trust. It hallucinates a lot and has no idea that what it just spit out is complete nonsense.

It does make writing quicker, but it's most effective when you already have an argument formulated, you just want some help putting the words together. 

If you use it to write everything for you, your critical thinking muscles probably will atrophy, but imo ChatGPT is just the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to undergraduate critical thinking skills.
