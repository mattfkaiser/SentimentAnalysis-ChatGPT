Iâ€™ve used ChatGPT to help with a couple of functions I was struggling with.  But it took a lot of time to engineer the prompt correctly to get it to not produce total trash that errored out. 

Even GitHub Co-pilot generally returns sub-par, inefficient, error-laden crap.  I had to disable it in VS Code it was so annoying.  

You canâ€™t replace knowledge. GPT can be a tool when used correctly, but it doesnâ€™t replace humans (yet).
