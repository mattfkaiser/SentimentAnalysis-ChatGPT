So, I can gather a bunch of Youtube videos criticizing a given popular movie, and from that, I can reconstruct that movie, in its entirety, but Youtube is not infringing copyright by hosting that material, nor is a critic infringing copyright by making it in the first place. I would be infringing copyright, if I took all those pieces, and put them back together.

A page doesn't plagiarize a book, and ChatGPT can only give me a page at a time. So, even in the extremely(I've just been trying, it's not easy to keep it on track, Harry Potter deviated rather quickly, might be able to do the whole bible though) rare instances where may be possible to reproduce a copyrighted work verbatim, I could only get the whole thing by asking for each piece. I would be the one infringing copyright.

How is that any different than [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors\_Guild,\_Inc.\_v.\_Google,\_Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc).?
