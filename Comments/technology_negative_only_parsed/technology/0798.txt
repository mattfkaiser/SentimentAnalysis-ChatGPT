The fallacy in your argument is that it is not a â€˜skillâ€™ to prompt ChatGPT to write your paper for you.

In the same way that it is not a â€˜skillâ€™ to go on Fiverr and hire someone in the third world to write your paper for you. 

Sure, if AI gets to a certain point, it could theoretically replace human writers. But weâ€™re not even close to there yet. 

In the same way that theoretically, robots might be able to wipe our asses for us some day. But youâ€™re going to be pretty disadvantaged in the world if you donâ€™t know how to wipe your own ass.
