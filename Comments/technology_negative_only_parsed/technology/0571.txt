Even this can be tricky if they donâ€™t have access to your computer. 

Take search engines. Like imagine I wanted to make sure that my students werenâ€™t using any search engines during an assignment in a computer lab. 

So I block google, bing, yahoo, DuckDuckGo. 

But there will always be one less popular one I didnâ€™t catch. Thereâ€™s too many that exist to block them all. 

Eventually that will be the same for AI 

Hell even today. ChatGPT gets all the attention, for good reason, but if that was blocked thereâ€™s other options. And those options will just get better and more popular and it just wonâ€™t be possible to block it anymore
