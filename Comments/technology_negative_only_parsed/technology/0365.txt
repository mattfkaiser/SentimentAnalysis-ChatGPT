You seem to be doing even worse. It sounds like you've never even used ChatGPT and are just theorising. 

I've just stated some facts about how people actually are using the tool. You are just basing what you are saying on some poor understanding of how it works. 

Maybe you missed my previous edit. But we don't need to speculate, we can actually test and demonstrate who is right. 

Why don't you come up with some example code and then we can actually test to see if ChatGPT can translate it to another framework or language, etc?
