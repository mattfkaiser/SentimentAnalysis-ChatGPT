I'm a senior guy at a tech firm,  and I basically generate the drafts of everything I need to write from chatgpt prompts.  Sometimes they are trash,  but in most cases it gives me a pretty workable framework where I can just mad lib in some details,  correct the factual mistakes or sometimes has,  but all in all I get more work done at a high level with tools like this.   If kids can't do that then they can't take my job from me,  so any teacher who works against that goal is hurting their career.
