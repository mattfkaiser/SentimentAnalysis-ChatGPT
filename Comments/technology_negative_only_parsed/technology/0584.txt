>Both students said they do not use ChatGPT to write their essays, but to generate content they can tweak and adapt themselves.

You can just think of ChatGPT as a time-saving measure in this context. All of the steps the tool took could be taken manually. Someone could research topics in books or in databases, restate the raw data into statements using examples from books and articles about writing, then structure the statements into topical paragraphs based on examples from the web, and add connecting statements and a thesis statement based on examples from the web. 

The problem is there is no internalization of these steps through your own experience. I didn't need any external stimulus to know the required steps to write a paper. A lot of education is concerned not  with subject matter, but rather the process of producing academic-quality material. I'm not sure how much of what they are doing in this process constitutes genuine education, yet they received good marks.

Education is going to need to revert to some old methods to ensure students are actually learning something. Recitation, live quizzing, more pressure in person to regurgitate material.
