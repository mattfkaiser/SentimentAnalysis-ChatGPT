??? It's impossible to encrypt anything in the way you're imagining - it's impossible for ChatGPT to give a response to an encrypted request without being able to decrypt it (well, a sensible response anyway...), and if ChatGPT is able to decrypt the request then whoever is controlling the ChatGPT server is also able to decrypt the request because they have access to all of the same things that ChatGPT does.

"End to end encryption" just means that nobody inbetween can intercept the message (which already exists and is being used with ChatGPT requests) - there's no such thing as a type of encryption where the recipient of a message can both use the message and also is unable to decrypt the message at the same time.. that's just nonsense - the recipient of the message has to be able to decrypt the message if they're going to do anything with it. This is a problem where people don't trust the recipient of the message, not a problem of the message being intercepted, and that isn't a problem that any kind of encryption could ever solve.
