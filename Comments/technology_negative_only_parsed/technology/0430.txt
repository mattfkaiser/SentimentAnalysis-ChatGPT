I mean I've spoken with a few university teachers about this and they're already adapting. They'll have to put less grades on papers and assignment and more on exams. 

They said that, for now, chatGPT is detectable to some extent because it tends to stick a recognizable structure, but they haven't raised any flag yet because it could just be the student writing that way, they didn't want to start a witch hunt. 

Overall, their opinion is that chatgpt doesn't teach you shit. So if you're not smart enough to figure out what chatGPT is saying is bullshit, then that won't help you. If you do follow the course content and can correct chatGPT and are smart enough to polish what chatGPT said to make an accurate assignment, then it's just another way of learning.
