The real strange thing is that if I read cited cases by another attorney that I couldnâ€™t find, Iâ€™d assume that they got a name wrong or the reporter wrong.

Like if they cited *Smith v. Johnson*, 104 So.3d 718 (La. 2019) and I could find it, then Iâ€™d try maybe 104 So.2d 718, or maybe 718 was the pin cite and it was actually 714 (though Westlaw wouldâ€™ve caught that). Or maybe it was Smith v. Thompson (but again Westlaw wouldâ€™ve caught it).

So after not finding it and trying a few alternatives, Iâ€™d just call them and ask what it was supposed to be, because never would I think â€œwell they just made that up.â€ Now Iâ€™ll have to think about if they used ChatGPT and didnâ€™t check itâ€¦
