Amen. Education can work, but itâ€™s like the US government and schools have equated education with output. As long as youâ€™re writing essays, submitting homework, and taking tests that means youâ€™re learning right? While most everyone I know has leveled the same complaints about classes being boring and not instructive, and openly either complain or brag about not remembering a single thing from many of the classes theyâ€™ve taken (myself included, for the most part). 

Education is about problem solving, and everything from essay writing to mathematical reasoning to forensics and stuff, meaning all the hard and soft sciences, are expressions of innate problem solving skills. But equating education to output is innately equating problem solving to regurgitating facts without context. The use of ChatGPT in education, just like its use in writing cover letters and resumes, is a symptom of the system being broken.
