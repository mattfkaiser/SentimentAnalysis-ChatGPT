if youâ€™re tired of hearing about ChatGPT, youâ€™re not alone. Itâ€™s everywhere these days! Personally, I think itâ€™s overhyped. I mean, sure, itâ€™s cool and all, but itâ€™s not like itâ€™s going to change the world or anything. And if youâ€™re not into artificial intelligence or language models, youâ€™re probably just bored by all the talk.

So, if youâ€™re going to talk about ChatGPT with someone, make sure youâ€™ve got something interesting to say. Donâ€™t just repeat the same old stuff over and over again. And remember that not everyone is as into it as you are.
