Thatâ€™s a totally different thing though. 
Wikipedia is an online encyclopaedia. We already had books. It just mad me it easier to access information. 

ChatGPT can write a whole essay for you. Something Wikipedia canâ€™t do. Itâ€™s not accessing information anymore but also producing a Â«Â well writtenÂ Â» output. 

Tbh Iâ€™m scared of the impact of this on future generation. Those kind of tools should only be used after you understand logical thinking, argument building, etc.
