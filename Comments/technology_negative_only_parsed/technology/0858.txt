Because it doesn't have internet connectivity the system can't verify the information sources even then it might get it wrong but it'll do a better job. You should not be using Chatgpt for sourcing ever, it will always get it wrong. Many of the issues that people are linking here are user error with not understanding the system, inability to use the api/plugins, and or have been rectified in the latest version gpt4 which in my opinion is leaps ahead in interpretability. In any event OpenAI needs a disclaimer on their outputs as honestly only experienced people in a field who can fact check should be using this program for anything important.
