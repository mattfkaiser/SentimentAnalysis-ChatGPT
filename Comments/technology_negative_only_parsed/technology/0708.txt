Even there they have been asleep.

There is plenty of evidence and talk about how Google search is becoming less useful and other options are growing in the search scene (including ChatGPT).

YouTube is getting ever more heavy with ads and less and less something people want to use.  YouTube is still huge but they are opting to make the experience worse which will slowly drive users away.

Then Google wants to disable ad blockers which only serves to drive more people away from their system.  They are making short term decisions to boost their numbers but will bite them in the ass down the road.

Google seems to be standing still with no answers.  They are on the decline.  Seems to happen when you get a lot of middle-managers each trying to hit their numbers for the quarter.
