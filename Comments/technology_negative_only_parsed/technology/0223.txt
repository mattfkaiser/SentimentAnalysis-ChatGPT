Yep. Meanwhile ChatGPT can take "<code> gives <error> in <programming language>" (copy-paste your line of code and error, fill in the language appropriately) and usually diagnoses the problem on the first try. But if it doesn't, it doesn't get mad or angry, it just moves to the next most likely issue. You could probably still catch it with some really difficult code, but it is faster than doing nothing and waiting, hoping someone else finds your post.
