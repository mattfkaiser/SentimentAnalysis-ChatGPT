(c) The availability of firearms to individuals with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or mental health issues poses a threat to public safety.
(d) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution provides for the right to bear arms, but also allows for reasonable regulations to protect public safety.

(a) Appropriations: There is hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.

Section 9. Severability
If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the provisions of this Act and the application of the provision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected.

Section 10. Effective Date
This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of its enactment.

I believe this legislation would make a significant impact on the issue of gun violence in the United States, while also protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.
