Iâ€™m a professional writer. Depending on the quality of the class, the fact is, ChatGPT could only ever write a C level paper.

ChatGPT writes in a very simplistic style, frequently is just barely (but noticeably) off the mark rhetorically, and inherently lacks an authentic voice.

And if youâ€™re not putting in the effort to write the paper yourself, anyway, you wonâ€™t be able to spot ChatGPT making these errors in order to correct them.

And speaking as a professional writer, correcting ChatGPT is more work than doing it yourself, because thatâ€™s the nature of imbuing prose with voice.

I think people are making a grave mistake to think that itâ€™s a good idea to outsource oneâ€™s writing to ChatGPT really in almost any case. (Except for a paper theyâ€™re happy to get a zero effort â€˜Câ€™ on.)

Sure, you can use ChatGPT to write your cover letter. Or that competitive scholarship essay. But you wonâ€™t be getting that job or that scholarship. Because ChatGPT pales in comparison to human writing on so many levels. 

Case in point, ever read someoneâ€™s â€˜bookâ€™ written by ChatGPT? Itâ€™s worthless.

The prose is bland and borderline white noise. 

Itâ€™s definitely a â€˜Câ€™ level essay writer, donâ€™t get me wrong. But thatâ€™s it. And its self sabotage to keep yourself limited for life at C level writing by relying on ChatGPT to write things for you.
