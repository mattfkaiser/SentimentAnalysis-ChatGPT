ChatGPT was able to write correct code in a programming language that I developed myself. The language was a commercial product in the early 1990s, and itâ€™s long since obsolete now. Thereâ€™s some material on the internet about it, but not really that much. I suspect it wouldnâ€™t need much source material to synthesize a style.
