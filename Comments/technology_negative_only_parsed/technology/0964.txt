> Is Wordâ€™s grammar and spelling tool also plagiarism?

No. They don't write anything for you. They merely correct your mistakes. The overall thesis, the arguments, the reasoning, the conclusions, the tone and the flow are still all yours.

>The thing about ChatGPT is that it isnâ€™t plagiarism. Because itâ€™s the content is generated by the userâ€™s prompt. 

No and no.

It is not generated by the student's prompt. It is - at least potentially - generated by the lecturer's question which is copy and pasted into the model by a lazy student.

And it *is* plagiarism because the student would be passing off work that is not theirs as their own.

>Itâ€™s not copied from Wikipedia or a book. 

True. ChatGPT is not plagiarising.

But I don't grade AI language models. I grade the *students* and if they pass off language model output as their own work, then that is plagiarism.

>So the definition of plagiarism doesnâ€™t take this into account and needs to be updated.

Interesting that you went from "this is not plagiarism" to "we need to change the definition so it's not plagiarism". You can't have it both ways.

Regardless, as a tertiary educator myself, it is my job to, in part, ensure that the students have the required knowledge. If they copy a question I put to them into a large language model and get the answer, then I have no evidence that they know what they need to. Even if you nitpick your way into it somehow not being plagiarism - unlikely given your attempts so far - then it is *still* cheating.
