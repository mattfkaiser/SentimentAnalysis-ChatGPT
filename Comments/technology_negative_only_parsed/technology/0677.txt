Itâ€™s interesting but not unique.

If you think about it, situations *like* this where you have to write some bullshit come up all the time in life. Cover letters, job screening questions, emails at work, reports, filler in papers (intro, concl., abstract), etc.

There are thousands of situations like this, and ChatGPT can do much more than just that too. If you learn how to use this thing itâ€™ll change your life.

Itâ€™s been less than 6 months and I cannot imagine living and working without it at this point. It would be a serious detriment to my life.
