AI can pass interview exercises because our interview exercises are shit.

My company does screening questions, code exercises, pre-recorded video interviews and theyâ€™re all useless in actually predicting how the face-to-face interviews will go. Weâ€™d have more success if we just said â€œweâ€™ll interview a random 10% of applicantsâ€. 

If ChatGPT accelerates the death of those techniques then itâ€™ll save everyone a lot of time.
