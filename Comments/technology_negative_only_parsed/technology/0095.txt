This was something I didnâ€™t understand until recently. Ask Chat GPT to give you the derivative of a complex formula and it will likely get it right.

Ask it the following and it consistently gets it wrong:

>	Maria has 17 apples.  John has five apples.  Sarah has a dozen apples.  If John takes half of Sarahâ€™s apples and Maria takes the rest, how many apples does each person have?

Itâ€™s ability to crib an answer to a problem that is mathematically complex or which requires obscure knowledge isnâ€™t the same as itâ€™s ability to understand the abstract meaning of a pretty simple word problem.
