Yes, but it's less about easy validation and more that good programmers already allow for difficult-to-find errors in their workflow. u/needaname1234 mentions "proper code review or unit tests", which hits the nail on the head.

In the case of familiar patterns in simple programs it really is easy to validate too.

On top of that, it occasionally introduces brilliant ideas to me I wouldn't have even known how to ask about. 

There's also a fundamental change in how I spend my mental effort. Instead of grinding away at the minutiae of writing code, I'm more-often thinking about what I want on a higher conceptual level. Features and design rather than nuts and bolts. For problem-solution pairs that can be expressed in 4k tokens or less, the moment I precisely and accurately frame my problem is the moment when ChatGPT provides a solution.
