>What does Sam Altman actually do?

I don't know the answer to that question either, but if a company is doing this great under the current CEO, that CEO must at least be doing *something* right. There's plenty of formerly great companies that went to shit after the CEO was changed. Don't underestimate whatever it is he's doing, we don't know what is going on behind the scenes.

>to be considered a visionary and worthy CEO nowadays?

A visionary, I'll leave that up for debate. Worthy CEO? Well, again, the company is doing absolutely great so it looks like he's currently worth his salt.

Look how Sundar Pichai is currently leading his company right now.
