When you use their free offering they get to use your chat material to train their models. With the API the say that they will not do that, but the APIs are significantly harder to use, and come with a lot of limitations. In either case, I imagine enough people have signed up to ChatGPT plus to offset a good chunk of their costs. If even 1% of their users are willing to fork over the $20 a month that it takes to get priority access, then that alone is already enough to cover all their operating costs, and that's before we start talking about their API fees.
