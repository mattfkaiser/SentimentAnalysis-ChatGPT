The way I see it, it's like preparing for an exam and doing training exercises, if you immediately check out the answers and don't even try on your own, you're not learning, you're just rot memorising, and yeah, you also won't be able to spot the mistakes that will invariably find their ways in the standard answers. 

Google is actually a good example of that, how many people are relying on the default answers that are shown in the front page, even though most of the time they're neither trustworthy nor relevant, because it  provides an immediate answer and you don't have to look further?

And to go back to ChatGPT, I'm personally simply not confortable with trusting a single  tool to always be right, mainly because a)being right is very relative depending on the question, and b)I fear many people will become even more complacent and won't use it in an optimal way, the way you're using it for example.

I'm holding my judgment for now  about how things will unfold in the future, but honestly I'm not very optimistic
