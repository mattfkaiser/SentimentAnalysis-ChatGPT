I’ve been coding for decades also. Slept with wires as a kid. Wrote code for an IBM mainframe in 5th grade, got a few degrees, finally a grad degree in all thing computer.

ChatGPT and Midjourney are the most mind blowing things have see in my love of all things technology to happen in decades. Use these tools daily. Saves me weeks of work.

The IBM PC with a 10 MB hard drive also blew us all away. 

But that’s me.
