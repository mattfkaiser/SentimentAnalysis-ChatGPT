I grew up in a world where calculators exist and are allowed in standardized testing. Someone who is ‘good at math’ is good at parsing a story problem, recognizing relevant information, and putting the the right type of calculation to the calculator, understanding if the result makes sense, and assembling the answer back into the story terms. 

If ChatGPT can do everything but the calculation and is allowed access to a calculator, I would say it is ‘good at math’ in the same sense as I am.
