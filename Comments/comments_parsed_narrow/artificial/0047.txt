Well, good heavens! We have an "AI scientist" among us. Indeed, accuracy is of paramount importance in scientific discourse. However, my dear Watson, you seem to be tiptoeing around the crux of our discussion here by replacing meaningful dialogue with silly appeals to authority and blanket dismissals.

You see, we're not in a scientific paper here, but in a casual conversation where simplifications are often used for the sake of accessibility and ease of understanding. Yes, the plugin does the math, but it does so within the framework of ChatGPT - they work together, much like the many examples I've provided. But hey, if you prefer, we can always go back to discussing filaments and light bulbs.
