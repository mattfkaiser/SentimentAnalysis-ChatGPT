It's hard to say without more context, but it seems like the author is making an assumption about the student's level of motivation without any evidence to back it up. As for teaching the student how to learn, that's a complex task that probably requires a skilled and experienced educator. While ChatGPT may be a useful tool for students, I'm skeptical that it can completely replace the human element of teaching. Ultimately, it's hard to judge the validity of the author's argument without more information.
