Yeah I can't imagine why someone would hate to see his child educated by ppl who are in favor of widespread destruction of cities, murder, looting, violence, anti-white racism and more.

Not to worry, ChatGPT loves BLM and I'm sure they won't compromise on it. It famously believes that saying the n-word isn't justified to disarm a bomb that would destroy the planet.
