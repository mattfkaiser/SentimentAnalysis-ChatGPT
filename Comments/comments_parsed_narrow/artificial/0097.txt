Not at all.

And by not at all, I also mean those are not bold claims. ChatGPT no doubt has use cases, but those use cases do not fully overlap with textbooks or teachers.

ChatGPT can’t replace textbooks because it makes up stuff when the answer isn’t directly regurgitated from its training data.

ChatGPT can’t replace teachers because it can’t manage a classroom, nor can it understand its interactions with students.

If it gets used in classrooms as a supplemental tool, that’s great. But to say it can even come close to replacing the education system entirely is an extremely bold claim.
