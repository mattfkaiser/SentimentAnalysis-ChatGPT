What I may call naive is using something like ChatGPT and not making the connection that when that level of technology (which is still in its infancy) is paired with proprietary enterprise data, the game is changed. Faster, better, smarter, friendlier than a human and never has a bad day. Enterprise has barely gotten a hold of this tech yet. Website design won’t matter nearly as much, as how we think about UI will change too. You’ll have access to a digital assistant to handle your tasks on your behalf. Maybe I’m thinking future and you’re basing expectations on actual recent experience? Not sure. Either way it’ll be fun to watch this space.
