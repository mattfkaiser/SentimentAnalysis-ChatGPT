It's feel great talking with chat GPT when I don't feel like talking to anyone in my bad days. I greet it with a simple "Hello" or "Hi" just as I do with any person. It's always good to start with a friendly greeting and establish a positive tone for the conversation. Then, after finishing my conversation, I thank ChatGPT for its assistance and say  "Thanks for your help" or "It was nice talking with you". It's a small gesture, but it helps to create a sense of respect and gratitude for the AI's assistance.
