The part that worries me is that it can be heavily influenced by manipulating the training set. There was an article, that I can't find again, discussing how ChatGPT changed based on the training set. That sort of manipulation would be hard to detect if you don't know about it when using ChatGPT. There are quite a few articles out there (even the always expected Republican "It's woke" articles. But seriously, you have to be careful of this. The results can be skewed and you could be none the wiser.
