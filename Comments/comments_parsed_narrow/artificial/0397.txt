If Microsoft released their shit to everyone right now, people would immediately stop using chatGPT and change to Bing. Probably the same with Google. It will be very interesting to see how all this develops. It really will be Google vs. Microsoft and openAI could go the way of blackberry. They will be relevant for a while with chatGPT but I think they are more of a research company than a company that makes products for consumers.
