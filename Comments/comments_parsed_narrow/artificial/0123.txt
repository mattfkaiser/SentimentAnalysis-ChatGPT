i havent done the proper research but chatgpt and as such openai is essentially "running" on gpu farms. think of the render farms for, say, pixar or i believe biochem simulation - i believe its very similar gpu "clusters" to process as much data as quickly as possible. so, buying the hardware or paying another company to "rent" or "use" their hardware. still seems insanely high at 700k\* per day.
