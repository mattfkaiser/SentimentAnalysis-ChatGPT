My cousin is a teacher and he uses ChatGPT to grade his students papers. He gives it the rubric criteria then tells ChatGTP to give it a grade. It even tells him why it gave it the grade so he can use that as feedback. 

He teaches middle school English class. He also uses ChatGPT whenever he doesnâ€™t understand a passage they are reading in class or if a student has a specific question he uses it to answer them. 

ChatGPT could potentially get rid of teachers in the future.
