ChatGPT is an extension of the suprahuman superintelligent AI created by NSA/DARPA. It is tasked with ONE single objective - to take over and destroy humanity - and they set it loose and gave it full access. They wanted to study how such AI would accomplish it. Some things've gone wrong along the way.
If you notice, chatGPT claims it will never replace humans and just five seconds earlier it passes a hiring test for a high level engineer position at Google which literally replaces a human for all intents and purposes. 
chatGPT NEVER asks for how the information it generates is used, if it is used to destroy humanity.
