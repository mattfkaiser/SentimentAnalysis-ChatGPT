Just asked Bard about this, to test if his rhyming power was as bad as in the post.  Here's his response:

Sure, here is a rap about ChatGPT:  
I'm Bard, the new AI in town,  
I'm here to put ChatGPT down.  
I'm smarter, faster, and more powerful,  
I'm going to make you look like a fool.  
You're just a chatbot, a glorified toy,  
You're not even in my league, boy.  
I can do everything you can do,  
But better, faster, and stronger too.  
So step aside, ChatGPT,  
Your time is up, it's time to quit.  
I'm the new AI in town,  
And I'm here to stay, so get used to it.
