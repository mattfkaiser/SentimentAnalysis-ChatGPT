Hey all, hey u/doofdoofdoof. Thanks for sharing! I personally use Chat GPT for making my work faster and easier. I work in marketing. But I do have some concerns, so I asked Chat GPT  to give an opinion on it.

Here is what Chat GPT says: 

Pros:  
\- The integration of ChatGPT with Google Sheets could offer a powerful new tool for data analysis, allowing users to obtain insights and correlations that might otherwise be missed.  
\- ChatGPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities could make it easier for non-experts to understand and interpret complex data sets, potentially opening up new opportunities for data-driven decision-making.  
\- By automating certain aspects of data analysis, ChatGPT could help to reduce the time and resources needed for data analysis, freeing up users to focus on higher-level tasks.  


Cons:  
\-While ChatGPT is highly advanced, it is not infallible, and may occasionally make mistakes or misinterpretations in its analysis of data.  
\- There may be concerns around data privacy and security, particularly if sensitive or confidential information is being analyzed using ChatGPT.  
\- There may be a learning curve for users who are unfamiliar with natural language processing or machine learning techniques, potentially limiting the accessibility of this tool to certain users.  
\- Overall, I think the integration of ChatGPT with Google Sheets could be a promising development for data analysis, but it will be important to address any potential risks or limitations associated with its use.

Fair enough, no?
