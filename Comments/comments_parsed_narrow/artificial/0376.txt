Continuing to double down won’t make you right. ChatGPT is cutting edge technology. It’s not comparable to google. It’s not comparable to wolfram alpha. How do I know? I’ve used all three, and I know how all three work. ChatGPT utilizes a brand new technology called transformers, which give it MUCH more utility than either of your other examples. Maybe try reading a paper on the technology, and you will maybe start to realize how revolutionary this stuff actually is.

I suggest before starting arguments with people who know what they’re talking about, you do some research of your own and actually learn how things work before jumping to such conclusions.
