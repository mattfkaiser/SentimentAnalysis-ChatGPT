I agree that many are downplaying the educational implications, but I'm also optimistic about it in the long-term. ChatGPT can meet you at your current level of understanding and target your misconceptions in a way that keeps you motivated to learn. 

I teach middle school, and 'that doesn't make sense to me, I'm going to shut down' is the norm for a lot of students. I've been using one of the education-related AIs to encourage students to write the AI questions until the concept makes sense, even if it means they have to write 1,000 "I still don't get it" questions. The one we've been using does quiz students through the conversation and has them explain back concepts in ways that *do* stick in their memory.

I do think there should be more honest conversation about how AI will affect our brains, but I think it will improve education in the long run.
