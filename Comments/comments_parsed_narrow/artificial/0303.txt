ChatGPT sucks at stuff like this. Cohesive stories I mean.

With something I see as very similar, I've been trying to get it to get it to tell a story about my hometown in my home state.

And it KEEPS mentioning this nonexistant yearly apple festival.

ChatGPT is broken in that it thinks that ALL small towns in the western US have an apple festival. And I haven't found anything I can do to change that. My hometown doesn't even have any apple orchards.

Similarly, ChatGPT is currently really bad at cohesion with long stories.
