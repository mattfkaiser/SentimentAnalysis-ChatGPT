I will never forget it personally. Just like I won't forget the first time I used the internet and when I watched Steve Jobs introduce the iphone. Both revolutionary moments and AI is the third revolution in technology I've lived through. I keep bringing it up at work but no one gives a fuck. They'll find out eventually and *they* probably won't remember chatGPT.

EDIT: OK, after reading the article, I think you may be right. Some executive compared it to the fucking Industrial Revolution and maybe I'm getting too hyped, but that actually could be true. AI will be fucking everywhere. Hopefully this time, instead of expecting people to be more productive because of tech we just have slightly more production and work less. The 40 hour work week really is rough no matter what you are doing for 40 hours. I suppose it's easier if you love your job, but honestly most people don't. This is a big deal and it's hard to explain to people how big it is because most people don't pay attention to tech.
