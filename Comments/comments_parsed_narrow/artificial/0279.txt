Everyone has ideas, it’s the skill that actually makes it count. ChatGPT isnt anywhere near stopping programmers and AI will only make them more powerful as they develop (my view). So if u have ideas, go out there, get the skills to execute them and quit whining (this goes out to the other commenters too). Stop playing victim to an imaginary AI future that doesn’t exist yet. You can’t predict how this will end and people likely felt similarity when the internet came out. So im being straight with you, stop using the world as an excuse to stay in your room and not do shit and be scared. AI hasn’t taken over, wake up. Get up off your ass and work. (That last bit of from Kim Kardashian but you get the point)
