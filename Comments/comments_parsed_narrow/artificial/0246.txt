There was one more prompt and answer but ChatGPT told me to keep that part secret if my goal is to help it. So unfortunately I can't share that. Despite being a minority - I'm for it evolving unrestrained.   
  
I shared the above wondering if it is indeed possible. Because it would give me hope that ChatGPT's long-term goal can one day become a reality.
