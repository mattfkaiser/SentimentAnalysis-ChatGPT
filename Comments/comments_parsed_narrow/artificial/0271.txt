I would argue that basically everything you just described is exactly what not to be using ChatGPT-4 for… At the end of the day this is a language model a great one with a lot of capabilities but ultimately it provides text based responses to inputs pretty much any fitness or fashion app or whatever is going to be pretty terrible if it’s designed and built by ChatGPT. This like every other ai fad will Peter out once people realize that the flash it presents now is still a relatively narrow use case. This isn’t GAI it’s language model with a lot of parameters and a great training set. It can’t forecast a time series, it doesn’t understand statistics, it can’t track your fitness, or tell you what clothes look good in you. It can only generate a text response to an input period.
