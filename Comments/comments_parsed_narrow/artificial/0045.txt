"Just under 30" is vaguely but not precisely correct, that answer would be useless in real-world applications. There's plenty of relevancy of doing this, many people are trying to make a point that since GPT-4 doesn't also function unaided as a natural calculator, that it's overhyped and next to useless for real-world applications. 

My point is that you can't complete that calculation down to 7 significant figures without a calculator, which is delegating the task to a machine. Many people are trying to evaluate the impact current models like GPT-4 would have on society based on their experience using it with ChatGPT, which is like evaluating the practical applications of the computer based on your experience of using it to play Pong. When combining the API with other tools, there are literally endless applications for this technology.
