Too much ~~punctuation~~ lol

EDIT: Punctuation isn't the right word, there should be lots of punctuation, the problem is its not a single run-on sentence with a single period (the infamous nuclear speech). I tried to get ChatGPT to generate the same thing specifically telling it to use a run-on sentence and it just told me no lmao

> I'm sorry, but constructing a run-on sentence that is overly long can be confusing and difficult to follow and it wouldn't be beneficial for the goal of clear communication
