Yes we are many that was into this thing before ChatGPT and the other recent landmarks arrived.

But most people had and have no clue of what is going on and I do not blame people for anthropomorphizing the shit out of it.

On your "google" analogy I can give you an example I currently are working on using Chad4:

* create google colab (I'm a programmer but not used to python and definitely not AI related)
* implement CLIP - I know what CLIP is and that's all, no clue of the inner works or how to implement.
* Import a video and extract every N'th frame to be thrown at CLIP.
* Make a summary of the CLIP results every N'th seconds
* and more...

All I have done so far is feeding the error messages back and got improved code in return.

I have got it working with no errors and 'a' result, not good but a good base to expand/optimize from. Learning a lot along the way.

Forget the project itself just look at all the different technologies used and imagine get it to run at all just using several google searches. I wouldn't start trying even though I have the black belt in google searches.
