>I fucking hate this buzzword, hype culture.

Ignore the buzzwords, ignore the hype, clear your mind and just be open to experience.  People will hype everything, no matter how useful it actually is.

I have taught several courses at the university level and worked as a tutor for nearly a decade. Many people attended my classes who weren't even registered, because they heard stories from friends about the quality of instruction.  The network effect grew, and eventually we had to close the door to outsiders because there weren't enough seats available, even in the largest lecture halls.  I won several teaching awards.  Outside of academia, as a professional engineer, I have over a dozen patents, and have developed technologies for startup companies which were acquired for nearly $100M.

Many people I know are elementary school teachers.  Their world revolves around their students.  They are passionate about their jobs and strive to make a difference in their students' lives.  I do not have much personal experience in elementary education, but after speaking and providing feedback to educators for thousands of hours, I feel that I deeply understand their challenges.

Over the past month, I started experimenting with ChatGPT for several hours each day.  I had three goals: (1) Understand the depth of its cognitive capabilities. (2) Understand how I could use it in my daily life.  (3) Understand whether my job security was at risk.  I am still in the process of forming a conclusion for each goal, but the summary from my experiments boils down to this:

It greatly exceeds the average human capability to **comprehend** and **communicate** nearly all forms of information.  My current estimate is that GPT3.5 is somewhere between the 95th and 99th percentile, and that GPT4 is beyond the 99th percentile. Somehow, in the soup of matter and code it is created from, it appears to have a human level 'minds-eye' to convert the English language into a model of the world (in a similar fashion that you can read a novel and imagine what is happening to the characters in the story).  Furthermore, it is masterful in its ability to convert this information back into English text. It can break down *anything* into easily digestible chunks.  If they're not digestible enough for you, you can simply ask it to break it down even further or explain it in a different way.

I want you to seriously try an experiment:  Think of one general topic you know a lot about, and a different topic you don't know anything about.  It could be anything: History, Economics, Psychology, Philosophy, Biology, Chemistry, Physics.  Spend a block of time each day asking ChatGPT to teach you about the topic you don't know and refresh you about the topic you are already familiar with.  After performing this experiment, draw your own conclusions.  I think you will be very surprised.  I was *shocked*.

Right now, the interface is just a text editor. Hence, 'chat' GPT.  What happens when it has a voice to enunciate and a physical avatar which can display body language? What happens when you start talking to it via Zoom-GPT? or interacting with it via VR-GPT?  A teacher walking around a classroom, educating people in a virtual environment is not so different than a teacher walking around a classroom and teaching in real life.  This isn't martial arts or something that requires physical contact.  It just requires information transmission and reception in the form of text, visuals, and sounds.

The implication of all this for teaching is straightforward.  It can understand students' questions better than most humans (comprehension), it can answer students' questions more clearly than most humans (communication), and it can learn new information and skills better than most humans (training).  Most teachers are average or below average; this is a statistical fact because the average was determined from the population teachers itself.

There will always need to be some physical place for kids to go during the day to interact with each other, learn, and grow.  There doesn't always need to be a physical place for below average teachers to be paid a salary for sub-par comprehension and communication skills.  The better that AI performance becomes, the more below-average teachers jobs become at risk.  As the AI learns and grows, its skills will eventually exceed world class teachers.  What happens then?  I have no idea, but it will be interesting to find out.
