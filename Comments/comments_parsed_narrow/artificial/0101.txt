Are we using the same LLMs? I use chatgpt and Bing for work and it can’t even do simple math. It gets the concepts of accounting correct but the numbers and intricate details are often completely wrong

As long as LLMs can’t differentiate between hallucinations and fact I don’t see them going anywhere. I will say though this is just the beginning it is exciting to see where it will go but I feel like this comment section is being overzealous
