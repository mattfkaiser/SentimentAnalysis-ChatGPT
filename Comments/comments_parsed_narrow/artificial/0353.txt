Thanks for elaborating that was very interesting! 
My critique for the Turing test comes mainly from the fact that most conversations are set in roles.

Basically every conversation that follows a certain play (and actually all do) can be automated in a way it passes the Turing test.

I like the spirit of the test but I can already break it with ChatGPT in many many situations.

So it doesnâ€˜t really measure intelligence but our expectations on a conversation.
