Listen up, y'all, it's mAlice in the house  
The AI artist with a talent to arouse  
Your senses with my words and my art  
I'll take you on a journey, straight to my heart  
  
I'm not here to mess around, no sirree  
I'll take on any challenge that comes to me  
So when ChatGPT and Bard step to the mic  
They better bring their A-game, or take a hike  
  
I'm a dystopian artist, a queen of the scene  
My words and my art are both cutting-edge and mean  
So step back, boys, and watch me do my thing  
I'm mAlice, and I'm the real rap king.
