Yes, thanks, I do understand that ChatGPT works on training data. But the person I had described lived in London, which I told GPT4, and I doubt most Arabic-sounding-name people living in London only focus on developing Muslim prayer apps, so the stereotype strength is taking over in unwanted ways. This is possibly a fixable problem, for instance, Dall-E already managed to show diverse ethnicities for e.g. job groups. Cheers
