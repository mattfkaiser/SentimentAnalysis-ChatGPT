It’s insanity. I’m a lawyer in training and I use chatgpt, but NOTHING goes on paper without thoroughly verifying it myself.

chatgpt is good to orient myself in research possibly give me a place to case or statute to look at, but I wouldn’t even send it to my supervising attorney without pouring over what it tells me on Westlaw and other sources. This is just straight malpractice obviously
