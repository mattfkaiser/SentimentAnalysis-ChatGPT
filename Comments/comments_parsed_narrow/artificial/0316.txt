So, I saw a comparison of three sermons side by side of the same source scripture.  The two ChatGPT sermons were different but of equal quality and were to the point of the source scripture.  The human generated sermon included parallels from other scriptures as well, which IMO was a bit gratuitous, but some may like that.

If that is what is meant by 'soul' then so be it.  I'll take none of the above, but that's just my preference.
