You clearly know nothing about chatGPT if you think it is more than a glorified google and that's my point people  e.g you believe its more than that.  Wolframalpha for example functions similarly minus the siri level text generation but mostly for sciences but there wasnt an obstacle to make it work for other stuff it just is not in the interests of the company.
