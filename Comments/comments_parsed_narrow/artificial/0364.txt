We don't know what GPT-4 will bring, because it hasn't been released yet.  But with the rumors about significant changes to the structure and how these models will work compared to previous models, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the exact same features you brought up.  Even ChatGPT incorporated many features I wouldn't have known would be possible at this point.  The field is moving exceedingly fast, and if anything, people are almost universally shortchanging the rate of progress AI models have experienced in recent years.
