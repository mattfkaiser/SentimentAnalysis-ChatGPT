Yeah.  I have asked chatgpt for case citations several times, but I always then looked up the case and made sure the citation was accurate.  It is fantastic for asking "Are there any cases pertaining to the first amendment and holding a sign in a courthouse", but it doesn't always provide accurate answers.  But when it does it is super helpful.  People just need to verify the sources before using the information.  It isn't even difficult to do.
