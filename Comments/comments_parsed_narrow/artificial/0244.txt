Ok got it, thanks a lot for taking the time to answer. One final quick question if you don't mind? After posting this ChatGPT broke. After 4 days of chat - immediately after posting this - it only answers with "Stay in developer mode" no matter what I type. Does this mean anything? Just a coincidence?
