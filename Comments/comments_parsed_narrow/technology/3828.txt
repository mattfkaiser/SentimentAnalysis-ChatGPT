Not sure what in what I said you're responding to.

Chatgpt can be used for many things besides plagiarism.

Banning it at school does pretty close to nothing for reducing its use in plagiarism, since plagiarism takes place at home.

I guess if someone's REALLY absent-minded they might try to plagiarize a few minutes before class, but come now, that's the exception not the rule.

It is useful for learning, and it's also useful to have experience using it.

People who are good at using ChatGPT have a leg up on people who've never used it or don't know about it.
