ChatGPT is mostly useful for creating a kickstart for individual functions. If youâ€™re deploying ChatGPT code to production without significant tweaking/test coverage you deserve what you get.

It flat out refused (wisely) to create a complete application (despite it being the simplest minimally useful application I could think of).

These are early days, however. Even with the current limitations, I can envision a tool appearing in a couple years that will generate full unit test coverage automatically (one can dream).

I also expect that AI will greatly simplify debugging and detecting security holes (rather than introducing them) but this functionality may be further out.
