Saw the other day where a teacher was having their students use ChatGPT to write about a topic they're discussing then critique how it did. Which is a pretty great way to use it. Not only do they learn about AI and how to use it as a tool, but they also get to see its shortcomings and probably realize that the professor/teacher also knows those shortcomings and what to look for if they tried to use it for a paper.
