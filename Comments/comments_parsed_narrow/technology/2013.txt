I used ChatGPT recently to help with a writing prompt on a book that we read in class at the beginning of the semester with several others read before the final. I showed my professor what the output was, and we laughed because it had several mistakes about the book. However, I told her that it did help me with my block, as I had a lot of problems coming up with ideas to write on. Having the program feed me a summary more or less was very helpful.

I likened this to being in a study group and talking about the prompt and then using the discussion to break your block.

There are ways to make this impossible, but that will mean a curriculum change and professors will need to ask students to think more critically, something which is lacking currently in the academic setting it seems.
