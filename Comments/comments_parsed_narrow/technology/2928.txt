What a waste of human resources to take this approach. Just move outside of the bubble and realize that students can't be measured by having them do assignments from home anymore. We live in a new world now, and chatGPT is an amazing tool for students who can ask it questions.

In a way everything should be reversed now. Learning should be done from home with help from AI, and only tests of understanding should be done in person, and if you learned something that was incorrect the teacher then has the chance to correct that.
