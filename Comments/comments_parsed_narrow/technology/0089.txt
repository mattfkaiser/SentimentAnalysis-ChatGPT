For an essay dealing with sentient AIâ€™s, I had ChatGPT write fake essays on the film Night Raiders so I could make a clever introduction. ChatGPT kind of just made up what it thought the movie might be about and wrote an essay using a non-existent piece of media. It was fascinating and really funny. It made up a fake release date and cast. It was quite convincing actually, but it was still very wrong.
