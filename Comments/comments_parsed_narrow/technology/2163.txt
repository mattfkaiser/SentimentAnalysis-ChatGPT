Has a hobbyist game developer chatgpt has been an amazing tool to just ask basic questions too. A lot of times, things on unreal engine are poorly documented. And I can ask a question and it'll pull comments from the actual engines documentation to explain it better than the website that was put there to explain these things does. It's not always right, but it's right often enough to be useful. And I have learned a tremendous amount through it. On top of that, I can ask it. It's basic questions while I'm learning things and it will go over a little concepts, I don't understand.
