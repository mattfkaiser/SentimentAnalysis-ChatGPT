This is part of the scary thing about ChatGPT. The bumbling professor just asked the AI a question like it knew how to answer, and the AI is designed to pretend it knows how to answer in the affirmative.

If people don't realize that being the best pretender it can be, not verifying information... is the default behavior of ChatGPT, they're not going to use it well. In fact if you wanted to use it constantly you'd just turn into someone that has to be an editor, a re-writer, a fact checker.
