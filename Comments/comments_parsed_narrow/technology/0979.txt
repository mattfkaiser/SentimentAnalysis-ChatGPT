I just asked chat gpt: Write a three sentence explanation on why it's unsafe to cross a flooded road, but misspell a few words in the explanation.


Here is the response: Krossing a fluded rode is vary dainjerous becuz yu cannat bee shure of the dept of the water and wether thers obstaculs in the way that can cawz yu to tripp or fawl. The watur can also be carrying debriss that can injur yu, and the curren can be very swifft, makin it hard to stay upriet and not get carrid awai. It's bedder to wayt untl the watur recedes and the rode is clear bfore trying to cross it.

Checks out to me
