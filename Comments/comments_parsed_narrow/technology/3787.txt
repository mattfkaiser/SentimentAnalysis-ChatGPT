plagiarism in this case isn’t about copyright but merely passing someone else’s work as your own. Its still stupid though ChatGPT is a tool, its like asking a librarian for help but that librarian knows anything about everything. I hated how teachers said wikipedia is a bad, yes its not a primary source to quote from but it cites its sources and is an exceptional baseline to build off of, AI does the same.

Edit: to those saying a librarian won’t write your essay for you i’ll recognize that AI has certainly lowered the bar of entry for cheating but it feels grossly naive to respond with BAN THAT SHIT, when it should be understood as a tool for learning. the internet made it so much easier to find that information and research you were looking for but it also made it easier to find people write your essay for you, and for even longer than that students have been cheating the ole fashioned and didn’t education didnt stop. Students cheat for two reasons 1) they don’t care about their education or 2) they aren’t prepared enough to show their true understanding of a topic. These wont just change on their own but as we adapted to how the internet changed our flow of information and impacted education so too can we grow with AI
