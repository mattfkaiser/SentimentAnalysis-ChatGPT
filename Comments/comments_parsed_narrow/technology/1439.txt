I sure hope ChatGPT isn’t involved in any decision making processes.  The other day I asked it to help me solve a worldle. Give me a list of five letter words containing M, A and E.  It list about 15 words.  The word MAYBE was not on the list.  When I asked “what about maybe” the program apologized and added it to the list.  Just to check I then asked “what about MONEY?”
 The program apologies again and added MONEY to the list, even though it doesn’t belong there.  

Im wondering if you could pressure the program into driving your car off a cliff.
