This is the worst possible use of chatgpt. At risk of being a little melodramatic, this represents the beginning of the death of truth. Chatgpt is not Google. It is not an oracle of truth. It **does not** synthesize from real sources. Every word it outputs is just what is statistically most likely to follow the words before it. There is no concept of correctness or truth

The idea of chatgpt being used to inform legal decisions should scare the shit out of you
