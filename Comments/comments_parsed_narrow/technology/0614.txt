you cant really use chatgpt for large chunks of code. usually it wont work and it's hard to debug large code. i only ask it small stuff. however, the small stuff is time consuming and annoying to google. so chatgpt is a massive help just for that. so i wouldnt say you need deep understanding of the language, you can ask chatgpt about any quirks you find or dont understand. it'll know the answer to all of those. that's like its specialty. you just need to test the code snippets it does give you to see if it does what you want it to do before using it in your code.
