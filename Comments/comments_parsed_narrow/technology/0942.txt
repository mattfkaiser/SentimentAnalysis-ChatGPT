Psychiatrist here. I'd love to see how ChatGPT measures up against me. I've been playing with it for the past couple days.  It's clever, but not wise.  You can trick it into forgetting its own values.  I'm not sure you can program wisdom and good judgment into a computer.  Maybe someday I'll be replaced, but today's not the day.

Radiologists, I'm not so sure. Sorry guys.
