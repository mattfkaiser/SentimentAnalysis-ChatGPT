OK as a programmer my first thought to solve these issues is have AI manage the child's entire digital screen time. Wanna play forrnite? Sorry little Timmy you haven't finished your daily writing exercise. An AI is cold and wont give in to whining and kids would quickly realise this. 

You also wouldn't have an AI manage a room full of 5 year olds...you'd have a room full of AIs managing a room full of 5 year olds. AI that can probably detect social disorders before anyone else and possibly even help curb disruptive behaviour early as well as identify signs of abuse/trauma that should be investigated.

Your book example - if instead a robot had read it to them... and they could interrupt that robot at any time to ask what something meant - you really think the retention would be as bad as scrolling down one long ass page? Im not a 5 year old and even I have trouble focusing on digital books vs paper ones simply due to the format and scrolling not being as easy to keep a spot and resume it as folding the corner of a page. 

Have you tried ChatGPT. I think if you do you may change your tune about being easily replaced.
