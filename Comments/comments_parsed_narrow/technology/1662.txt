I have a friend who used to joke about Mozart's famous tour of the American colonies in the 1780's. We took a day trip through Virginia one day and we were listening to Mozart. He proclaimed, "Wow! This is really pretty! No doubt what inspired Mozart to write blah blah blah after his much publicized trip through the colonies in 1780blah blah blah!"

Mozart never visited America, but as a joke I asked ChatGPT to write a story about Mozart's famous tour of the colonies. It stubbornly refused.I reworded the question and it refused again and again. I think eventually it agreed to do it after I changed the wording to, "Suppose Mozart decided to tour the American colonies in the 1780's. What would his fictional trip had been like?"

You can get around the filters, but it takes some finagling sometimes.
