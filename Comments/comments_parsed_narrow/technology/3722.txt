AI cannot FIT inside of everything. This shit requires hardware with far more processing power than even most Americans can afford. Everything I've heard about the hardware AI needs to work leads me to believe that ChatGPT costs OpenAI a ton of money to run, and that they are only temporarily offering it freely for testing/feedback purposes. I doubt it's affordable to put AI inside of everything.
