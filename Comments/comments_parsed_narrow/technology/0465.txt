While that's a good thing for you Americans to do, it's not the end all be all.

Here I am with a good healthcare system where I don't pay anything to get access to doctors, psychologists, etc., don't have to wait much, and can normally book sessions online.

Yet, I'd still prefer ChatGPT (or a medical LLM). It's even more convenient... So I'm going to prefer it if need be.
