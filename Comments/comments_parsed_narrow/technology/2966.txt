Id be happy to use ChatGpt to get my first drafts (im a lawyer). But the actual meat of it cant just be delegated to AI, at least not for a long time. 

Most of my time isnt spent on the first draft. Its spent thinking how can I structure this sentence to emote a certain thought or feeling in the reader with these set of facts. 

Say someone obviously breached their contract. There’s no actual defense. They breached it. Cant just roll over and admit to it though or client will be out of business. How do I say “he didnt do the thing” in a way the judge goes, “aww, poor guy. He really got a raw deal. I *guess*  an equity doctrine could apply in this because of xyz” instead of “fuck that guy. Next case.”

What that process looks like is me sitting alone in a room in front of a computer screen staring at the same sentence forEVER. Say it out loud. Read the whole paragraph. Save a version. Then change two words of the sentence. Read it again. Role play as the judge. Then as opposing counsel. Try to anticipate their answer. Change the two words back. Read it again. Delete the sentence. Start over.

The thrilling life of an attorney. But when you get it right, oh its such a satisfying feeling. The unlocking of the perfect combination of words to make others see things from a specific point of view, and then actually be persuaded by it. It’s a craft.
