>When I’ve seen in class essays mentioned, people get all offended like it’s some sort of horrid suggestion. People, we did that all the time when I was in school.

I love writing, and I enjoy writing essays. I'm working on a COMMS degree right now and all I have left to do at this point is literally to write. Every course I have left, is about writing shit. I'm not even tempted to see what ChatGPT could output for me. A lot of my coursework is related to interpersonal communication and the professors often want you to tie that shit to personal experiences. ChatGPT can rearrange words but it doesn't really replicate true, personal experience and practical knowledge.
