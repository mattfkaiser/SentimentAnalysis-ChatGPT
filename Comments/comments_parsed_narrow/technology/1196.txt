I’m not in school and I’ve only used chatgpt a couple times so here’s my informed thoughts: what if students end up using gpt to generate a draft, but because there will be a way to check for gpt , students will have to revise it to the point where it can’t be detected. I’d imagine changing sentence structure, substituting words, other stuff idk, would that process offer any value? Like you’re not actually writing the thing but you still need to write.
