I don't know why you're being downvoted. ChatGPT will never, on its own, prompt itself to act. It must recieved some form of input.

So unless people tell me they sit, staring at nothing, until someone feeds them an input, I'm going to keep getting more and more concerned that people are gradually becoming more and more infatuated with ChatGPT.
