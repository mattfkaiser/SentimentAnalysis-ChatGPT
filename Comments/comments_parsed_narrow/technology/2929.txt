Kids that had help from their parents, older siblings and tutors always had the advantage over those kids that didn't. Now every kid gets a home assistant that can help them doing their homework and learning in the process. Stuff that gets you a grade should be written in class and not at home, where kids have always had it easy to cheat and get outside help. I really don't see the problem and outrage. People are acting like kids are using chatGPT while writing an exam in class.
