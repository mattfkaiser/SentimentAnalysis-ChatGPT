Reality is, it probably might not affect Google that much. I mean even if Microsoft has the edge over Google right now, Google could easily come up with a better chatbot considering that they have more data and resources to allocate towards it. Plus even if Microsoft utilises this technology to make bing search engine more advance, it'll likely won't slump Googles search engine usage overnight, users will keep using something they're familiar and confident with. But that being said, chatgpt is pretty cool, and I'm looking forward to what Google might come up with. Competition is what drives innovation.
