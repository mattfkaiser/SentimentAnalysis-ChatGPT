I think you missed the point of the Picasso line. Good artists take inspiration from great things and then waste time trying to make them their own. A great artist understands beauty and truth for what it is and waste energy trying to find a personal deviation from perfection.

Blocking ChatGPT because some moronic students will use it to write their whole essay is throwing away the baby with the bath water. In reality, many students will use it as a tool to learn - at least half the students in a classroom understand the importance of their education. As educators, it is our primary responsibility to instill in our students the understanding of understanding. Most of them are smart enough to learn from static material if they know why they should. We are shepherds for the most part. ChatGPT will help students in different ways. It is our job to make sure they understand the gravity of the situation. In any case, they’ll have to learn how to use it in the real world

Edit: I replied to the wrong comment. The bit about missing the point isn’t aimed at the comment above
