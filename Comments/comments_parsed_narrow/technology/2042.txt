Oh for sure. I just think the breakneck pace is so fast, that the other structures society relies on (like academia), cant keep up. That inablity to keep up and adapt to a rapidly changing world, presents some deeply concerning challenges right on our doorstep.

Dont get me wrong, tools like this are *insanely useful* and i look forward to leveraging tools like ChatGPT as a data assistant, but getting from here to there safely, is tricky.
