Or you can say “write out 25 steps it would take to code Tetris in Java” and then start like the method before.

Once it makes the window or does the first step (sometimes the first step is weird) keep saying “Modify the code to include that”

When ChatGPT reaches its limit and randomly stops, say “continue in a code viewer” and it will continue where it left off.

I want to create a jank ass Mario clone, so I could say:

 “Create a window in Java, center it and size it to 1280 x 720.”

“Create a character in the center, it can be an image or a basic shape.”

“Modify the code to let the user move the character with WASD like Mario.”

“Modify the code to let the user jump with the space bar like Mario.”

And then you just keep going hahah
