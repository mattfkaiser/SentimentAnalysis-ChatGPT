I'm fairly certain Google and Microsoft don't explicitly state that they will use your documents stored on/created by their services for their own purposes (assuming that they do at all, since it'd be a massive risk if they were doing it behind everyone's back).  OpenAI does.  They're very up-front about the fact that nothing you say to ChatGPT is in confidence, and in fact it will be used for further training of their models.
