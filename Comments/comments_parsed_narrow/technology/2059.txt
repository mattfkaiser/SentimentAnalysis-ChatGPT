Schools just need to adapt to chatgpt. Teach students how to use it to do research, how to ask questions to get more accurate answers, how to get it to format things correctly, how to check and make sure it doesn’t give you wrong information, how to organize and compile it into an essay, how to take a one sentence fact and give a better explanation of it, etc.

Ai isn’t going away and schools can’t just ignore it. Remember back in the day when teachers used to tell you that you wouldn’t always be walking around with a calculator in your pocket so you couldn’t use it on the assignment? That’s basically what you’re saying with describing assignments that would avoid chatgpt instead of working with it
