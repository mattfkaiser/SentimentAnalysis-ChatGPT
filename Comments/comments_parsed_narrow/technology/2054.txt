yeah it's caused me a fair amount of cognitive dissonance since i first played around with chatgpt last fall. still, i stand by my advocation for more careful discernment on the use of ai in the arts. the ai landscape is changing at incredibly speed which to me means we should be asking the hard questions and figuring these things out sooner rather than later. 

given the US's track record with updating regulations to the demands of tech innovation and our current political handicaps, I'm mot super hopeful :')
