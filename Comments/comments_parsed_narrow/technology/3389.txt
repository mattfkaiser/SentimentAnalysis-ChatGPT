Unless ChatGPT can deal with dumb software requests and read peoples’ emotions while navigating the workforce politics in all of this. I’m not worried about it taking a programmer’s job. What I could see it do however is take over Google’s job. As a developer I do a lot of searching over the net to figure out certain things. If ChatGPT gets advanced enough to get me my answers faster, then bye bye Google.
