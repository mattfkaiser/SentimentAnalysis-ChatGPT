I'm all for ai utilized in work to increase efficiency in labor, but in academia, it's not just being used for efficiency by people who know processes and methods already. AI is more and more being used to shortcut that stuff. 

proponents of AI in academia act like it's no different to using a calculator but thats a seriously inept false equivalency. a calculator has a limited scope for use and it's not going to get you far in mathematical theory. with the most advanced calculator in front of a middle schooler, they arent going to stumble across the formula for the total sa of a cone in the middle of an exam. 

if AI use described in the article was merely a means to efficiency than these students should have gotten approximately similar grades on papers written with or without using chatgpt. but their essays using ai got significantly better marks. 

if we're okay with students finishing higher education knowing how to use ai better than the nuances and skills of their field, then fine. but we should probably figure  out sooner than later if thats acceptable or not.
