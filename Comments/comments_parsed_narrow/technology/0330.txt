People keep saying that they let chat GPT fo all of their homework in college. They use it to write their 5 page paper. Thr things it comes up with are down right laughable. It might make 3 weak points throughout the whole thing. It does however have a use. To gather suggestions and give ideas. 

"I am writing an essay about the US involvement in WW1. Can you provide some starting points for ideas" and then further refine the input and outputs from there. Then go write the paper yourself (with citations to actual sources). That's going to put you much further ahead than "write a 5 page essay on the US involvement in WW1".
