Ulpt: You can prime chatgpt with a sample of your own writing and it can mimic it (to a certain extent)

A prompt example (not mine):

Type the following text prompt: "The text below in {} is a writing sample, please digest the sample into an abstract description of the writing style, including attributes such as formality, conciseness, persuasiveness, narrativity, exposition, poetry, satire, traditionality, personalness, activeness, simplicity, persuasiveness, descriptiveness, narrativity, exposition, poetry, satire, formality, informality, experimentalness, journalisticness, conciseness, detail, vividness, clarity, precision, flow, coherence, clarity, grammatical correctness, and structural soundness. This output should be a list with the header of "Here is my writing style, I want you to use this style when you write prose for me:" For each attribute, write an instruction starting with words like: Avoid, Use, Maintain, Demonstrate, Adopt, Provide, or Write. These instructions are intended to guide future writing to mimic the attributes of the writing sample, and they are to be written in affirmative language. Avoid referencing specific information from the writing sample. Write the description and only the description in a clear and concise manner as a numbered list. {writing sample}"Â
