I know I was foolish to click the link, but this is such a good idea that instead of reading it, I pasted it in quotes to ChatGPT paraphrasing that a little bit the direction:

"Rewrite the following article, being the text within quote marks, with more flowing language and less bias towards shallow analysis:"

That direction could be improved, but the ChatGPT model (took some time) and output something that is at least easier to read:

*"OpenAI's ChatGPT, a language model released in November, has been put to use for a variety of purposes such as composing cover letters, writing a children's book, and even assisting students with their homework. The chatbot's capabilities are seemingly greater than anticipated, as Google discovered that the bot could potentially be hired as an entry-level coder if it were to be interviewed by the company. Amazon employees who tested ChatGPT were impressed by its ability to answer customer support questions, create training documents, and answer questions on corporate strategy. Despite its strengths, ChatGPT has also shown to generate misinformation, provide incorrect coding answers, and make basic mathematical errors.*  
*A 2013 study by the University of Oxford predicted that AI would eliminate 47% of US jobs in the next 20 years, but this prediction may have been overstated. According to Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, human judgement still needs to be applied to AI technologies to prevent errors and biases. She stated that AI should be viewed as productivity-enhancing tools rather than complete replacements.*  
*Jobs in the tech sector, including software developers, web developers, computer programmers, coders, and data scientists, are particularly vulnerable to AI displacement. ChatGPT and similar AI technologies are capable of performing mathematical computations with great accuracy and could potentially produce code faster than humans. This means that work could be completed with fewer employees. Some tech companies, including OpenAI, are already exploring the idea of replacing software engineers with AI. On the other hand, Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor, believes that AI will enhance coders' work rather than replace them.*  
*The media industry, including advertising, technical writing, journalism, and content creation, is also at risk of being affected by AI. ChatGPT and similar AI tools are good at producing written content and have the ability to read, write, and understand text-based data. Economist Paul Krugman stated that AI may be able to produce reports and articles more efficiently than humans. The media industry has already started experimenting with AI-generated content, with CNET using a similar AI tool to write articles and BuzzFeed planning to generate new content with OpenAI's technology. Despite these advancements, Madgavkar believes that the majority of work done by content creators cannot be automated and requires human judgement.*  
*Jobs in the legal industry, such as paralegals and legal assistants, may also be susceptible to automation. AI is capable of replicating some of the work that these professions do, as they consume large amounts of information and make it digestible through legal briefs and opinions. However, AI will not be able to fully automate these jobs as they require human judgement to understand a client or employer's needs. Market research analysts are also vulnerable to AI displacement as they rely on synthesizing and analyzing data.*  
*In conclusion, while AI has the potential to displace some jobs, it should be viewed as a productivity-enhancing tool rather than a complete replacement. Human judgement is still necessary to prevent errors and biases, and some jobs will be more vulnerable to automation than others."*
