I think this is the key difference here between AI and a person. chat GPT is just a really fancy box that tries to guess what the next letter should be given a string of input. it doesn't do anything more, or anything less. this means that it's much more of a evolution of older Markov chain bots that I've used on chat services for over a decade now rather than something groundbreakingly new. it's definitely way better and has more applications, but it doesn't understand anything at all which is why you can tell on more technical subjects that it doesn't understand what it's actually doing. it's just spewing out word soup and allowing us to attach meaning to the word soup.
