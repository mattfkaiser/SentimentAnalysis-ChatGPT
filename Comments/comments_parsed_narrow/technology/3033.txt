Naah.

Anyone who thinks its easy to cheat with chatGPT has never been a teacher. I've played with chatGPT and I can tell you right now that there is no possible way I'd ever mistake its output for something a real student wrote.

In the future that may be a bigger concern, and I think the process in the linked story isn't a bad approach.

But right this second if you turn in a paper written by chatGPT I guarantee you that the person grading it knows you didn't write it if they've ever read anything else you wrote. And if they've played with chatGPT they don't even need to have read something you wrote first, one or two paragraphs in and you say "ah yes, that's chatGPT". It has a distinctive style and a distinctive set of mistakes and repetitions its fond of.
