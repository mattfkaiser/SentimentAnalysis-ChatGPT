The best DM thing I use ChatGPT is for descriptions of things. What players see, hear, smell, taste, and feel is my weak point. So I will ask ChatGPT "Describe to me what characters in a jungle experience with an emphasis on the heat and humidity." 

And can read almost verbatim ChatGPT's responce: As the characters step into the jungle, they are immediately hit with a wall of heat and humidity. The air is thick with moisture and every breath feels like they are inhaling warm water. Sweat begins to bead on their foreheads and trickle down their backs, making their clothes cling to their skin.

The lush vegetation of the jungle surrounds them, with towering trees providing shade and shelter from the harsh sun. The ground beneath their feet is soft and spongy, with a thick layer of fallen leaves and vines covering the earth.

As they move deeper into the jungle, the sounds of chirping insects and singing birds fill the air. The scent of blooming flowers and vegetation hangs heavy in the humid air, intermingled with the pungent smell of decaying leaves and mud.

The dense foliage of the jungle makes it difficult to see far ahead, with vines and branches occasionally tangling around their feet and legs. The characters must use all their senses to navigate the jungle, feeling the texture of the leaves and vines as they push through the thick underbrush.
