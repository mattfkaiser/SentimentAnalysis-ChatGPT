I think this is all a knee jerk reaction without asking the important question of why?

Chatgpt is no different than hiring someone to write the paper. Maybe it's just democratizing cheating. After all, it's lot lower cost. Wolfram Alpha has been capable of solving most any Calculus 1 - 3 I've thrown at it for over a decade. We haven't heard about the death of math degrees.

Is the argument that degrees might be awarded to dirty cheaters? Is the fear that someone could make it through a whole program by simply cheating? Is there a fear some students might have overly high GPA that make it difficult to bucket them?

That all points to other failures that the uni system need to adapt to - rampant cheating and gpa inflation has been a thing for decades. The only change here is everyone can do it. I'm having difficulty seeing the actual downside.
