Can’t say I’m surprised. This feels a lot like how the Apple/Google App Stores went when engines like Unity became more popular and a bunch of shovelware started choking out other well made apps. The books ChatGPT writes may not be any good, but that doesn’t mean these won’t take over the marketplace.

Definitely a bummer of a time for me to have learned how to actually write novels. I have to wonder how many new authors will be written off as ChatGPT products whether or not they are.
