I think the moderators are right to be concerned about the increase of posts generated by chatgpt. This language model is very advanced and can deceive people with plausible but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Also, it can violate the rules of reddit or the copyrights of other sources. I think chatgpt should be used with responsibility and transparency, and not for spam or manipulation
