I'm a high school teacher.  I played with ChatGPT, feeding it various questions from my curriculum.  It did a mediocre job at many essay type questions.  If a question involved making specific references to a text, it fell on its face.

It's scary how we have shifted from laziness as motivation for cheating to what's now an epidemic of an inability to process and generate thoughts/ideas.  These kids want to Google the most basic things, including their opinions.
