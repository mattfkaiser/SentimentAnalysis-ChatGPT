I have written a couple of books that are published by Amazon Print on Demand.

I'm somewhat lucky in that I write technical manuals aimed at niche audiences. While this automatically limits my audience - these books will never be *Harry Potter* - it also means I actually *have* an audience, built-in, as there are not many competing books out there.

I sell 1-2 books a day. Peak sales, like on the day a book is released, is about 9. 

My sales rank per book pings around 30k on a really good day, to maybe 1.2M when there's been a bit of a dry spell. As of this second, book 1 is at #120k, and book 2 is at 660k.

There are 49M books for sale on Amazon.

So book 1 is currently selling in the top 0.2% of the set of all books, and I probably sold 3 that day.

Unless you can pull a Rowling or a King and catch lightning in a bottle, the way you make a living as an author is to not write 1 big book, but 50 books with some degree of legs, and then live off your back catalogue.

As for the ChatGPT books, my biggest problem is promotion; informing potential readers of the books that the book exists *at all*. That is a nut I have not cracked - and a problem facing *all* authors, AI or human.
