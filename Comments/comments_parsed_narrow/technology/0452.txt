I'm using ChatGPT to help me write grants. What used to take a team of people to put together a decent and fundable grant proposal now only takes two of us (one focusing on the project narrative and program design while the other focuses on the budget and budget narrative). What also used to take an entire team of grant writers weeks to accomplish now takes a couple days. And the key factor here is this: Every other grant writer I know of, and who I am in competition with, uses ChatGPT and other AI platforms to do this work. If I refused to use it, I'd only be shooting myself in the foot. Educators need to understand that industry is already utilizing AI platforms to make their processes more efficient. Those entry-level employees who understand this and know how to use them appropriately will have an edge over potential candidates that do not. This is happening in industry and needs to seep into post-secondary education IN THE LEAST; high school students would benefit from understanding this as well.
