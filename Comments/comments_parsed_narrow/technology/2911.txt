So chatgpt does your job at a C level, sounds about right.  

Couple of years back, it couldn't write convincingly at all.

Few years (3-5, tops) in the future, it will out-write you. I'm sorry, it just will. A few years after that, it will out-write anyone who has ever lived in any language. 

So, which students will be better prepared for that world? Those who learned to write the way you and I did? Or will it be the ones that learned how to interact with AI in such a way that elicits compelling prose? 

I promise you that it will be the latter. Don't fuck up your students' futures teaching them to use an abacus.
