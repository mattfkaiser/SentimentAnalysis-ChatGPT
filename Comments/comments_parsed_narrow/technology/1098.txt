I mean, I get why people think it's banal. Practicing most skill is pretty banal. Like being able to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Yeah, incredibly banal and something a computer could do but absolutely necessary for actually learning how to do it yourself.

And I think what's getting glossed over is WHY ChatGPT is able to write these essays. It's able to do it because it analyzed tons of essays that other people have written. It doesn't inherently know how to write essays out of the blue. So if there was no one capable of writing those essays without ChatGPT to being with, it'd never happen.
