You’d basically have to setup your whole class to support that new style of testing, because those oral challenges would take much longer to assess.

It also defeats the purpose of written revision, and the recursive writing process. Analyzing and revising one’s own work is practically more important than the first draft. Public speaking and writing are two entirely different skills, which I’m sure you’re aware of, even if the argumentative structure is similar.

I agree with all your points on this thread. There’s no easy answer and I really hate the amount of people that say “teachers need to be better” in response to ChatGPT when in reality they’re just projecting their grade-school resentment on today’s problems. 

It’s incredibly challenging. Kids are already stooped in their own online echo-chambers from a young age. I think you’ll start seeing Critical Thinking 101 instead of Comp 101 in the future, because it won’t be about the writing as much, but the methodological thinking process (which is best displayed in writing imo).
