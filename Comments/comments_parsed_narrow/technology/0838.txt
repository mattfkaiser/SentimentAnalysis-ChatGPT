To put it more bluntly, ChatGPT will give helpful and accurate answers to certain kinds of questions (“What should I consider before getting a dog?”) and, what is less widely appreciated, entirely fabricated answers to others (like what is the menu option for achieving XYZ in Adobe Illustrator, it will just invent menus and tools and settings all day).  For a lawyer to think ChatGPT is citing real cases *and never check* is beyond stupid.
