It'll probably be a while before you can run it fully on your average phone or computer. I'm pretty sure ChatGPT is using GPT3, which is a massive machine learning model that genuinely requires an entire data center's worth of computer hardware to run. When I was bored I was playing around with a language model that uses an older version of GPT that is far smaller and it could run on my single NVIDIA RTX 3090, but it essentially *required* an NVIDIA RTX 3090 and it wasn't as convincing as ChatGPT/GPT3 is.
