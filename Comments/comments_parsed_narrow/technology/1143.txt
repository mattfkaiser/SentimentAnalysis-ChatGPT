I learned about it through a seminar for college professors on how to utilize it rather than ban it, and one of the biggest reasons they promote it is to help people with disabilities. I am getting a PhD despite having pretty severe ADHD (recently diagnosed) and having ChatGPT or Tome create outlines as a place for me to start is a revelation. 

I get so overwhelmed trying to start a paper that it causes huge problems for me. I have to insert all of my own thoughts, research, and citations in there anyway so I don’t understand why people act like it’s “cheating”. It’s not like ChatGPT can do actual work, the limits prevent it from being able to process a whole article and it doesn’t cite it’s sources well.
