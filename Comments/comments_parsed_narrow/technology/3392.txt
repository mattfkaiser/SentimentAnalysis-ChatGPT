At least with the kind of dev I do, this is the biggest factor.  I just started a new contract for a customer who could not even explain the task.  They handed me a monster spreadsheet and said it doesn’t match the system and they want to know why.  They didn’t make the spreadsheet.  I never got to talk to the person that made it.  The person that made it doesn’t use the system or do things in the same way, use the same accounts, etc. I spent the first 2 weeks trying to gain enough contextual information to figure out what they were probably asking for.     This is an extreme example but this is business dev in corporate America.  And yea, they’re interested in how chatgpt could help them.  Omg.
