Ha that explains the strange words. Poetry is devilishly difficult to translate into another language. And I agree even knowing I was being tested by you i had to admit I couldn’t say for sure what it was, only that it felt very different  from what I knew to be chatGPT . I did a little reading on that poem and there’s a lot of cultural context, a knowledge of Zen, the poet’s own life, that would help in understanding . It’s not that he was being deliberately obscure, it’s that he expected his work to be read by people who would have some clues. And again, haiku is tricky because there is necessarily little material to work with.  But I still stand by my assessment that there is such a thing as bad poetry and that for now at least , chatGPT can’t write a decent Haiku. Maybe never will because as I said before , we love to insert ourselves into literature and we are able to enjoy even bad or synthetic poems and stories. Maybe that’s the whole point of literature, to be a shared interactive art form, but it begs the question of what art is. I don’t like AI generated “art” as you might guess. Now where did I put that buggy wip?
