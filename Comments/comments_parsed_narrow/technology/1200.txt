I’m a teacher, and I’m currently using ChatGPT in the classroom for numerous things, like creating engaging projects for my class. It’s also a valuable resource to help explain concepts outside of the everyday curriculum to different demographics of students, say explaining nuclear fission to a fourth grader.

While there are risks that students will use this inappropriately, teachers should be focused more on exploring the benefits of ChatGPT as a learning tool *with* their students, not pushing them away from it.
