Yeah, they've definitely not marketed it as a calculator, but when people think it's an oracle and they're already talking with ChatGPT they often just don't bother pulling up a real calculator. And I think OpenAI needs to do a better job of making sure people know they shouldn't do that.

"ChatGPT: *get instant answers*, find creative inspiration, and *learn something new*" on their product page for chatgpt.

The splash screen for ChatGPT before you give it your first prompt gives some examples, two of which are "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" and "How do I make an HTTP request in Javascript?" both of which imply that it is intended to give factually correct answers.

Bing's chat was a rebranded OpenAI LLM, IIRC. And it's very obviously intended to replace or augment bing searches.

And I haven't seen any public statements from OpenAI about how people shouldn't use it to get factual information other than some half-hearted disclaimers that say "it miiiight maybe sometimes be a little wrong about something." And those disclaimers are not worded in a way that tells you not to use it for getting facts, they just ask you to be cautious (as a way of covering their asses legally, I presume).
