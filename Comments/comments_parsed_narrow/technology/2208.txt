This is where I’m at. I’m a beginner with Python, learned the fundamentals of operators and functions, found that library documentation is tedious to study, so I just have ChatGPT parse all that for pertinent info for me to incorporate. Debugging the code given to me has taught me a lot about how it all goes together, rather than watch dozens of hours of boring tutorials online to accomplish a similar thing.
