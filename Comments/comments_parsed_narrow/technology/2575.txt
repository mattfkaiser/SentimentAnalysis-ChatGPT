That's because Google has been lazy and didn't put the effort into AI.  Look at the Google Home/Nest line.  They've had it out for over half a decade and *literally nothing has been improved*.  Where it's still better by Alexa, Bixby and the biggest trash of the bunch Siri - It's still leagues behind ChatGPT.  

All it'll take is someone dropping ChatGPT into a voice assistant and Google's finished.
