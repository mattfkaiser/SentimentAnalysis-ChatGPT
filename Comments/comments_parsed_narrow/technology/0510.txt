Obviously I don’t think AI is a replacement for therapy. But I’ve been in therapy for a while, and ChatGPT has allowed me to “practice” bringing up conversations about trauma with my real therapist, who has helped me greatly. I think it serves as a good outlet, but probably nothing more. Still though, grateful for that role play!
