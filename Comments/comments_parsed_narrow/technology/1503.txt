As a professor myself, I have to say that I feel like education is reaping what it has sown to some extent with these issues.

I see the real problem being that students don't think of school as an opportunity to learn, but as a system to get the grades they need to pass on to the next level of what they want. 

In a world where education worked for what it was meant to do, students might be interested in using ChatGPT as a tool to help them learn to write better, and a minor one, because what would be the point of just using for an assignment? Then they don't learn anything and what is the point of going to, or paying for, school then?

But parents, schools, the world, just emphasize achievement and not learning.

These students are just fucking themselves over for their future, but it's our jobs to help them understand that.
