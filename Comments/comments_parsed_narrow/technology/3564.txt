It's extra depressing because chatgpt genuinely has massive potential as a writing *aid*.

You can knock out text fast, not worry too much about small mistakes and then it does a beautiful job of fixing any errors and you can even ask it for commentary/feedback and suggestions for improvements. 

There's a lot of crappy books from amateur authors full of spelling mistakes and errors that would benefit a great deal from, essentially, a very cheap editor/proofreader.

But instead people are just pumping and dumping bullshit and they're doing it so much they're gonna cause platforms to ban **any** use of these tools.
