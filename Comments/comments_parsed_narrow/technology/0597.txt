People think ChatGPT is super smart, and it is, but not without its fault. It will not only make up the citation, it will straight make shit up if it doesn’t know the answer, and provide the fake citation to “prove” it. If you didn’t know any better and took it at face value, it looks super believable. But that’s the scary thing, people don’t know any fucking better.
