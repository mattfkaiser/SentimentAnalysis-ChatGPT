Nonsense. ChatGPT is just an alternative to Stack Overflow and looking up documentation (it provides roughly the same information). It can make you more productive, but if you were already proficient with google it's not going to change much. All the most frustrating parts of the job are untouched, including the most important: taking business requirements and translating them into code. You can't tell ChatGPT "I need to write a new page that takes quotes from several brokers and displays them for the user to select".
