Funniest thing is its just google translate feeding into chat gpt.  

Its funny because the word busy road might equate in their language to literally water dragon and chat gpt just takes the literal translation.

If you ask it in chinese to talk about how to deal with busy roads you get back a response on how to deal with water dragons because its just translating the chinese to English and plugging it into it.

If they were using their own work it would be using chinese grammar and phrasing.
