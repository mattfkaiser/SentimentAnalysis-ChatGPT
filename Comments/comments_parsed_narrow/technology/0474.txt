The last 3 therapists I've had have been completely incompetent in being able to actually provide any help. Just sit there, listen and make generic, short winded responses as if they were tired of listening to me and just wanted me to leave. Very little compassion from these hags. Meanwhile the advice I've received from ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful since talking to it. I'm better able to navigate difficult relationships and scenarios as I always have an outlet to discuss things with. I wouldn't believe everything it says just like I wouldn't believe everything a human therapist says with their biases...

My last therapist recommended I start believing in a magical being (God). Said it might help me with my issues if I were to accept religion. Started injecting completely delusional shit into conversation and then suggesting that committing myself might help me find God and peace. That last practice I went too was filled with trained and licensed therapists simply manipulating everyone that went in to either become more delusional or to convince them they were in an attempt to get them committed. And I know 3 people personally who have been taken advantage of by mental health professionals and become mere shells of their former selves. 

I truly believe there are more of these bad therapists than good ones here in the South. It's a systemic failure and it begins somewhere in their education cycle (though I'm not trying to call them woke).
