I mean *you*, at least as you are conceiving it, don't exist as a matter of physics.  You get tired because your brain releases chemicals to regulate your sleep cycle.  You wake up because your brain is reacting to external stimuli or it's decided that sleep cycle is over.  You're happy because of serotonin and dopamine your brain releases in response to inputs like sex or food.  You're sad when you don't get social contact because we're hard wired to be social creatures.  All of these decisions are 'made' long before you're consciously aware of them.

That's why questions of consciousness are tricky.  Are *you* in charge of your meat suit or is your conscious experience an executive summary?  A post-hoc rationalization to explain things the brain has already decided.  Evolution found it useful, but just because free will or conscious thought helped us survive doesn't mean that they are the only form of intellect.  It's possible consciousness and free will are illusions.  We may just be making statistical predictions about the world in order to keep a self-perpetuating system alive and that conscious thought independent from exterior input just doesn't exist.  

Long story short: The line between conscious experience and statistical engine predicting stuff based on inputs is a lot fuzzier than you're implying.  

ChatGPT isn't conscious though and anyone who thinks it is is nuts.
