> ChatGPT doesn't synthesize information and is frequently wrong.

Do people even use ChatGPT? I can prompt it generate unique objects or names using completely random concepts or themes and it does. Is this not synthesis?

>Information synthesis is the process of analyzing and evaluating information from various sources, making connections between the information found, and combining the recently acquired information with prior knowledge to create something new.

ChatGPT creates new stuff all the time, that's why people say it's wrong.

>Instead, he see's ChatGPT being more akin to a search engine, which will enhance the work we're doing.

I hate when people say this about ChatGPT.  It literally is a fucking search engine and more. Right now. Go try it. You prompt it to give you a list of websites related to a list of keywords and it will.
