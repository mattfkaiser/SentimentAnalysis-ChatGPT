> plagiarism: the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own

Copyright has to do with plagiarism because anything a human writes is automatically copyrighted. Work an AI creates cannot be copyrighted as it is not considered a human. And if it is not a human is it not "someone" and therefore copying its work is not plagiarism. Chat GPT also cannot have "ideas". It is a statistical language model that simply outputs text based on how probable the next words in the sequence are. It is not a general AI and does not understand anything it is saying. It does not truly know what an orange is, though if you ask it what an orange is it will tell you because it knows where in its database a description of an orange lies and it will repeat it with a few alterations.
