Lawyer here. I was understanding until he asked Chatgpt to verify its own citations. But then and worse was that when challenged by the judge and opposing counsel to produce the bogus cases he went back to Chatgpt and had it spit out full text versions which he filed with the court. 

He should have used Westlaw or equivalent to shepherdize/cite check his cases in the first place and discovered his mistake. But after the judge came back and asked him to verify his research, verifying the case numbers against a research tool, not Chatgpt, should have been the obvious step to take. Hearing the judge and opposing counsel say they couldn't find the cases should have been a bright red flag. Law is complicated but not at all secret. Dude fucked up several ways and doubled down on his mistake.
