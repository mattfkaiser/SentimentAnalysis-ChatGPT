"He said that a more likely outcome of large language model tools wouldbe industries changing in response to its use, rather than being fullyreplaced.Â "

Yeah, of course, but this is by far what companies can have access to once GPT4 hits.  Not to mention more specific designed AI that uses a language model for an interface.. We have yet to see the peak of this type of AI, let alone combining it with other AI systems..

I don't see ChatGPT replacing a team of any means, but an AI that is 1/10th the size and training length, absolutely can if its for a single area.

Edit: Forgot my point of posting.... Below.

Industries wont even have time to adapt before an AI that can replace workers causes them to adapt again.
