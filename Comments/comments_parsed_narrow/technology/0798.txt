Stack Overflow was fucking groundbreaking. It replaced a shitshow of disparate forums with answers buried deep into threads spread across multiple pages with next to no searchability. In its early years it was where coders went _before_ Google, instead of only going there when you couldn’t find an answer on Google. It grew, it had issues, and it adapted, sometimes poorly. My problem with it now is it’s become more like the forums it replaced—it’s hard to find a _current_ answer. Answers from 10 years ago still show up, but are wrong our outdated. I think now it’ll be “quick google, ChatGPT if it’s more complicated, maybe back to google, stack overflow if I have to”.
