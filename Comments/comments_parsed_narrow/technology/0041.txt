Because it feels like magic. A lot of people already struggle writing something coherent on their own without relying on the work of others, so it's not surprising to see something produce complex text out of thin air.

The fact that it's a really fast process is also a big factor. If it would take longer than a human, people would say it's a dumb waste of time and not even bother.

I mean, we live in a time where tl;dr is a thing, where people reply with one-liners to complex topics, where everything is being generalized to finish discussions quickly, where nuance is being ignored to paint a simple world, etc. People are impatient and uncreative, saving time is the most important aspect of existence right now, in order to go back to mindless consumption and  pursuit of escapism.

People sometimes say to me on social media they are 100% confident my long posts are written by ChatGPT because they can't imagine someone spending 15+ minutes typing an elaborate comment or being passionate enough about any topic to write entire paragraphs, not to mention *read* them when written by ohers.

People struggle with articulating their thoughts and emotions and knowledge, because everything these days is just about efficiency. It is very rare to find someone online or offline to entertain a thought, philosophizing, exploring a concept, applying logical thinking, and so on. 

So when "artifical intelligence" does this, people are impressed. Because they themselves are not able to produce something like that when left to their own devices.

You can do an experiment, ask your family or friends to spend 10 minutes writing down an essay about something they are passionate about. Let it be 100 words, make it more if you think they can handle it. I doubt any of them would even consider to take that much time out of their lives, and if they do, you would be surprised how much of their ability to express themselves has withered.
