I do think people are overhyping the AI right now, but yes in the future this might be easier than Google.

Go ask Google how to make pasta. You'll have your results in a second.

Go ask ChatGPT and it'll be about a minute before it has finished typing shit out.

And because Google is showing you the most relevant information, it's curated information. People go to this pasta site a lot, it gets linked to other places a lot, and it looks to have been written by a pasta making pro... in short, you can trust it.

ChatGPT might have listed 3cups of water for 2 cups of flour, simply because that was the most probable quantities it calculated. Not because it's a good pasta recipe. Nobody knows if it ripped off an actual pasta maker's recipe, or generated total bullshit.

This is why ChatGPT isn't really that big of a deal right now for Google. What it might be useful for is handling basic IT questions or customer service issues without needing to involve a higher level tech to assist the customer.
