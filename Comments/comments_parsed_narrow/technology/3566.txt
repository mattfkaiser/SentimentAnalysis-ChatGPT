Chatgpt is already leagues ahead of its predecessor, which was capable of coherent individual sentences but nothing long-form. Chatgpt can now write complete essays and does a decent job of remembering things. That improvement is largely due to increasing the size of the AI model by 10x. If the next gpt is a further 10x increase, then it's not improbable that AI will be writing half decent books that make sense. It should have a much better understanding of structure and composition, maybe even themes and metaphors.
