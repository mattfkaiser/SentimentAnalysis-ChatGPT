I've found a similar rabbit hole of it going awry. Try asking chatgpt who directed the movie Cyrano de Bergerac, then ask it to name other movies directed by him (Jean-Paul Rappeneau). For some reason, it'll list a bunch of made up movies that don't even exist mixed in with actual ones. Pick one of the made up movies and ask it to tell you what it is about and how it relates to the director's overall work. Chatgpt will not only make up a full plot and cast list with movie stars that obviously never did those characters, but it will also explain how this made up movie fits into the director's aesthetic and themes. All indistinguishable from an actual movie.
