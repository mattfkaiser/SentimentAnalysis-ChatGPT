DONT USE THE INTERNET FOR SCHOOL

I was at the very, very beginning of this when you were still more likely to find something at the library. 

Then later...

DONT USE WIKIPEDIA 

Why not? Every article has several or hundreds of linked sources from videos to paper books. I now know what materials to go through myself. Is my assignment to learn classic research methods?

Do we make every generation of new scientists drop apples on their heads?

Is my assignment to write a paper about X or is my assignment to only do research the way the teacher did thirty years ago when I was their age?

It’s the same thing again. These tools are like idiot baby versions of Star Trek computers. I use it sometimes to generate a quick summary on niche topics that either I wouldn’t know the wording to straight up ask Google, or they would be unlikely to even have a Wikipedia article as it’s an intersection of two or more topics. 

There’s nothing wrong with being able to do a week of research in a few hours. 

Now... in the old days as a kid maybe I had to read hundreds of pages of text on paper to get the information I needed. Would I be vastly more immersed and well-rounded in the topic and ancillary areas, as opposed to modern focused research methods?

You betcha. But then you have to make THAT the assignment.

ChatGPT et al are just another generation of tools that if applied properly will benefit us all overall. 

Twenty years from now we’ll be complaining about the introduction of another new tool.
