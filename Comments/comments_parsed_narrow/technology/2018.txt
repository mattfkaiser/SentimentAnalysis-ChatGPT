High school teacher here.  I wish my (mostly middle class) kids could write as well as ChatGPT.  It follows basic rules out outlining pretty slavishly while most of my kids - even many in honors classes - still write in a very “stream of thought” style.  I’d be thrilled if the average paper I saw was as organized as ChatGPT.
