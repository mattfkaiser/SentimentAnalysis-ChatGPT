Yeah well they say it can code or answer technical questions. I asked it questions related to my job as the senior software developer and lead at my company. It didn't know anything. It repeated technical documentation and spit out some garbage code it took from github. If you want poems and stories from something with no concept of feeling or reality, boilerplate documents that already exist, or are generally incompetant at your job, chatgpt is for you.
