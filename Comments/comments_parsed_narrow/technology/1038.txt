I believe it is a refined model trained on Chat GPT. 

I don't know if he is toxic, he is definitely a capitalist. He increased the price of a med which was patented in 1953, while another family killed millions of people with an opioid crisis, with the help of many doctors. There are levels of toxicity. 

I am sure he is doing this to raise capital, and that is how the world works people invest in things for many reasons and publicity is one of them. I doubt all of the people invested in Apple have a desire to make tech better, they want to make money. Doctors, programmers etc will work for him if he pays them. 

I watched a few of his blogs on Youtube just before, he does mention a little about the process/people involved. 

Building a medical AI is expensive, look at the costs of building OpenAI. So I don't think it is outrageous to get some publicity to acquire capital.
