I could agree, having a tool to help with structuring your essay and finding an order to write in could be considered cheating, but essay outlines are also the part I struggle with the most on. However, I still heavily edit the outlines I receive, and in the end it’s entirely up to me to provide the information required to make a cohesive and well written essay as well as cite the sources that I received the information from.

I can see how using ChatGPT to assist on any step of the essay writing process is considered cheating, but in the end I still need to know the information personally to make sure the information that’s being outputted is actually true and not just ad-libbed. 

The last essay I wrote (and the only essay I’ve ever used ChatGPT’s assistance with), I poked the AI for help with an essay outline just for shits and grins, and what it helped with the most was structuring the information in a way that flowed well and made the most sense to read, and helped greatly with what I needed to research to get the work done. But in the end, I’m still the one doing the research and writing the multipage essay. I wouldn’t use the app to write an entire essay, but using it as a tool, I’d argue, is a great way to understand what you’re trying to learn.

Because in the end, I’m not just trying to churn out a thing just to get a grade, I’m trying to better understand the subject that I’m writing about.
