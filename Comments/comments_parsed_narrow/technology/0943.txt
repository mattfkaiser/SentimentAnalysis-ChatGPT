Well, some of the most useless and entitled idiots that I have came across in this life were doctors. 

You can be a prick and know your craft but most of the times it’s just not the case. And it’s not like you can argue with them or sue for a misdiagnosis. 

Hopefully, chatgpt will replace most of them and make way for really skilled people that can actually practice this craft.
