Of course there's competition. Everyone knows Google and more companies will be releasing their chatbots too. They're all competing against each other. People have known LaMDA is coming for over 2 years already and know from the research papers what its potential is. OpenAI have been competing against them for years already. Being first to release doesn't mean much when it's clear ChatGPT's accuracy is shit and unlike Bard it doesn't have up to date information.
