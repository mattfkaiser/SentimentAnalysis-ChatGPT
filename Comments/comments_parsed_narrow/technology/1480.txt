If they ban ChatGPT, they certainly aren't wrong saying that there are no protections for minors, and that it does collect too much data. I can see that. But what's up with Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp), Google, Microsoft, Apple and the like? In my opinion these are way worse. No protection for minors and so much more data collected. Even when you try to opt out, so people think they're safe but really aren't.

I think we really should regulate established tech giants further, ChatGPT needs a much more conscious decision to collect your data.
