I have already addressed this in other comments. It's not just about using ChatGPT, it's how to use it so you don't even up like the Samsung employees. Or like the US military when their soldiers started strapping fitness devices to their wrists and uploading their movement + GPS to Strava. Were the soldiers morons? No. But the military had to "teach" them how innocuous things can leak information to outsiders. The cost of those fitness devices was trivial. But having Strava collecting detailed, near real-time data on US troop movement and secret base locations was priceless! The bigger your organization, the more it costs to roll out new tools. Even simple ones.
