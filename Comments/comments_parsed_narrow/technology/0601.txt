I’ve played with ChatGPT for my legal practice. It often gets the general principal correct, but its justifications (legislation and common law citations) are largely erroneous. On occasion, I’ll call the Chat on its flaws, and it typically addresses the one error I pointed out, but replaces it with a new erroneous statement. If I press it enough on errors of legislative citation errors, it eventually conceded and changes its legislative justification to a common law justification…which it also cites erroneous or fake cases.

I find that it does a decent job at creating outlines, basic motion structure, and argumentative phrasing. It can even do a decent job of analyzing a particular piece of legislation or common law. However, it’s ability to accurately cite is noticeably lacking. 

It’s a good jumping off point, but shouldn’t be used as the foundation of an motion, let alone as a final product. It doesn’t appear to understand what it is generating. As one user pointed out, “it’s just a very advanced spell check.”

Edit: A word.
