While this is true—AI can and will spout untruths—this feels like the early days of Wiki. Everyone said Wikipedia was an unreliable source (particularly in higher ed). And yet it's become a crowd-driven staple of research. Pretty soon it won't need humans to update it, just humans as peer reviewers.

AI is only as good as the influences that teach it, like any child it can grow into a productive resource or a little asshole. It's up to us how we want to reinforce learning.

I can say ChatGPT has already done a great job of answering questions I used to ask Google, and more concisely.
