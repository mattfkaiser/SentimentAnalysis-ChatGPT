It absolutely can come up with something new or at least something that may appear to be new. It's learning database will get bigger and bigger and it will become more and more advanced that it will be able to pull information and construct it in a way that it will appear to have original ideas or the knowledge it obtains will be so vast that it will present something as new that most of the world has never seen yet because that obscure data exists within its database. You can easily fake a personal experience with a prompt. I just had it write a birthday card to my niece a few days ago. It was very personal with one simple prompt and I asked it to dumb the reply down and sound more robotic so she would know I was lazy and used ChatGPT and not write this super personal card to her. I can have it write a fake scenario about an actual revolution of the past and tell it to add something about me being a major role in that revolution and it will do it. And it will only get more advanced from here.
