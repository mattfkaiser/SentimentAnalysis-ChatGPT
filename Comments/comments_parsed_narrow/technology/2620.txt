There is a difference now that affects how this sort of tool is used. 20 years ago people relied on credible media outlets (newspapers) that had a legal duty to clearly separate fact from opinion and speculation. 

Today, the only goal of any platform, or at least the platforms people actually read, is money as expressed by clicks. Even once-reputable news sources are more and more opinion- rather than fact-based. Facts are secondary.

If AI tools will generate content that make people click more and spend more time reading, that is what will be used, truth be damned.

You really can't compare it with calculators because calculators tell the truth. ChatGPT does not, or at least cannot be trusted to do so consistently, which is the same thing.

This is about significantly more than jobs. It's about the collective idea of what reality is. We will each of us, more and more, only see fake news created by AI tools to look like facts and honest opinion, based on micro-targeting marketing models of what will make us spend more time at a platform and ultimately buy something.

We are talking about the destruction of what makes a society a society, and right now it is about polarization for political gain. Soon enough it will be about more and more fragmentation for economic gain. Until nothing online will be trustworthy, and nobody will know it.

In a world where most people can't (or need to) do math because they learned to trust calculators, what would happen if every calculator out there gave you the answer it thinks you want to see?
