The vast majority of software engineering is spent communicating with stakeholders, planning, designing, and modeling solutions. The actual process of writing code is not the majority of the role or even the most difficult part. Once you know what your problem and your solution are suppose to look like, its much easier to put code together that will accomplish your goals. Having a tool that helps write code more quickly when you understand everything else is actually pretty cool and not really a danger to the discipline of software engineering. Engineering requires thought and creativity, this is something ChatGPT or any other AI type tools cannot do now or potentially ever.
