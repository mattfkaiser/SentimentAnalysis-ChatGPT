A friend of mine recently said to me: "prepare for academia to become as hard as it once was."

Professors already start changing assignments here, all thinking hard about the "human aspect". Meaning, the times of "imma just cite the 5 first books on wikipedia" are over. Now we're talking application of knowledge.

If that truly happens, then ChatGPT may have revolutionized academia in the 21st century. We'll see.
