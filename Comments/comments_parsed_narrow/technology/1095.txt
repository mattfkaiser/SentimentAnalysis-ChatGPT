After being on n the real professional world for 15 years, I support anything that makes professor lives more difficult. The amount of pettiness in academia is just astounding. Attendance policies.  Points off for stapling papers the wrong way. Banning phones in class. -10% for using the wrong font. It’s absolutely absurd.

It’s especially bad in liberal arts. Literature. Humanities. Etc. I believe the study of those things is important, but all the bullshit sure takes away from the message. 

I get students get more out of reading their “own” chat gpt essays than sitting in the lectures.
