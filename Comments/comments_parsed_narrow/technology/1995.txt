I have asked it to answer questions that it didn’t want to, and then I led it into the subject with a couple of more innocuous questions and ended up getting it to answer the “offensive” question it refused to in the beginning. One of the first things I tried with ChatGPT was to expose biases that the system may have against certain groups of people. It takes a little bit of extra time, but it can be manipulated into talking about subject matter that, depending on how you phrase your question, it might have refused to speak on the first time. It’s almost like you have to convince it that you’re writing a paper on the subject and not just looking for validation of crazy opinions.
