How these detection models work is by examining the probability that each token would follow the preceding part of the text under that model.  The ones for GPT-2 are fairly reliable.  I am not entirely sure how one would even get access to the information to do this on GPT-3, if OpenAI provides it or something else, but the same approach should theoretically be possible.  You could also try a number of different approaches since ChatGPT has a very strong model average for its writing style in the absence of specific instructions.  People can usually tell that text is written by ChatGPT just by looking at it... if you can identify it, so can a machine.
