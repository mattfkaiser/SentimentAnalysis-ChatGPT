Yeah honestly I had no idea they had already implemented it into Bing, I knew that was the goal and that it could be a gamechanger but I didn't know we were there yet.

Just to nitpick, it doesn't change anything about what ChatGPT is, what they did is they took GPT3.5, used it to build a super advanced chatbot (ChatGPT) and now synced it with bing so that the chatbot (and thus GPT3.5) can only provide answers that are "allowed" by the Bing results. That's my understanding as a relative layman.
