Marketing and history can be equally academically rigorous. The degree to which one is challenging will highly depend upon the specific school or even instructor. 

In my marketing class, we had to work as a team of four to determine the evolving brand strategies of four major consumer packaged goods companies, and then compare and contrast their evolution in terms of effectiveness, innovation, cost, awareness, etc to develop 5 conclusions/lessons for other CPG companies. The project was written up in a detailed report and had to be summarized in a three page memo and presented to the class in 10 minutes. 

Far more rigorous than my history classes, where I had to write the 5,000th 5 page analysis of “child labor during the puritan era” or “impact of British industrialization upon the environment.”
