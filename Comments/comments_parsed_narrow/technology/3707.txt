I replaced my content writers  with ChatGPT. I am saving about $1500 to $2000 a month. 

I don't have to worry about my writers getting inspired or dealing with them on exactly what a client needs. Also, I don't have to add SEO key phrases or geographical terms for local SEO. 

My workload for content marketing(articles and blogs) has gone from 10 hours to 2 hours a week. 

I can now schedule a whole month of content marketing with scheduling weekly posts through WordPress. 

It is a gold rush like the dot com bubble of 2000.
