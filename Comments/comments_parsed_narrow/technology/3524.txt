And so computers and the internet is also cheating, because you're accessing information more openly, and in a less restrictive way, where before you had to rely on what you heard around your neighbourhood and trust in the news papers.

It's not about cheating, it's about ease of accessibility to information, which is the correlation that I am making and arguing for.

I am not saying that ChatGPT, calculators, the internet and what not cannot be used to cheat, I am saying that because we know it is possible to cheat, and that this technology clearly has tons of practical use cases, we should not restrict or ban it, but rather integrate it, as in a way it is inevitable. And change the way we teach, and focus on what AI cannot teach right now.

I hope I made myself a bit more clear about what I meant this time ðŸ™‚
