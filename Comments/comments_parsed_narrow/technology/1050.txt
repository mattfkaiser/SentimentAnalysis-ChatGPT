It was really surprising to me in college the number of people who got by with extremely poor writing skills. Had to help my boyfriend rewrite a section of a group project contributed by another person because it was so unintelligible that it was nearly impossible to even edit. There are a lot of people who are intelligent enough to do well in their classes so long as they don’t have to write, or if they do have to they’ll just pay someone else to do it. I guess now they’ll just use ChatGPT.
