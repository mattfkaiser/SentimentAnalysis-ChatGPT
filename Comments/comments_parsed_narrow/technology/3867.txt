I think the other part of the issue is that if you're able to ChatGPT your way through your degree, employers ultimately wouldn't need to hire grads in that area because they could just hire an admin assistant on minimum wage to use ChatGPT. 

Which leaves the inherent value of education in a topic you're passionate about - but you're not getting that either, if you're ChatGPT'ing your way through uni.

I suspect the net result is universities will have to shift away from coursework and only do in-class assessments and exams, which makes things a lot harder for most students.
