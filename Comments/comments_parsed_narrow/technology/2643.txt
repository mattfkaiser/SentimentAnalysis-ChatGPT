I agree it's not going to threaten any but the most menial writing-based jobs anytime soon. But it is a serious cause for concern for teachers, who are going to lose some of the valuable assessment and learning tools (like long-form essays and open-book, take-home tests) because ChatGPT will make it too easy to cheat on them. The most obvious alternative is to fall back to education based on rote memorization and shallow, in-class tests, which are very poorly suited to preparing people for the modern world or testing their useful skills.

Many people compare it to allowing calculators in class, but they totally miss the point. It's easy and even advantageous to assign work that makes a student think and learn even if they have a calculator. A calculator doesn't do the whole assignment for you, unless it's a dumb assignment. ChatGPT can do many assignments better than most students already, and it will only get better. It's not just a shortcut around some rote busywork, like a calculator; it's a shortcut around all the research, thinking, and idea organization, where all the real learning takes place. ChatGPT won't obviate the usefulness of those skills in the real world, but it will make it much harder for teachers to exercise and evaluate them.

Teachers are coming up with creative ways to work ChatGPT into assignments, and learning to work with AI *is* an important skill for the future. But this does not replace even 1 % of the pedagogical variety it takes away. I still think it's a net-beneficial tech overall, but there are some serious downsides we need to carefully consider and adapt to.
