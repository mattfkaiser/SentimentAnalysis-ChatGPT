Yeah, I find it's excellent for simple snippets and basic/intermediate questions, but falls apart fast if you try using it for anything more complex.

That's still useful though, as software engineers are always having to learn new things or interact with aspects of things they haven't touched before. Plus Google's search results have _really_ gone downhill in the last half year or so.

And since it's software, it's usually quickly obvious if ChatGPT is blowing smoke or not since it won't work. I would be wary of trusting it with any questions that have less immediate consequences though - e.g. security implications.
