I've specifically seen Chat GPT write things that were clearly incorrect, such as listing a town in southern Texas as being 'located in Mexico, just south of the Mexican-American border'. That's a pretty big thing to get wrong, and I suspect that if people start generating articles and pasting them on blogs without checking, future AI may use *those* articles as sources, and away we go into a land of widespread incorrect 'sources'.
