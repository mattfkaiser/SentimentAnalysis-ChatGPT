This story broke on Reddit the other day. That professor is a straight up moron. Every paper he ran through chat GPT was flagged as written by the AI and he didnâ€™t have the critical thinking skills to try to write something himself and upload it in the same way?

When OP disclosed his name some Redditors found his dissertation and ran it through chat GPT and of course it said that it wrote that too.

What a fucking moron. He should be fired on those grounds alone.
