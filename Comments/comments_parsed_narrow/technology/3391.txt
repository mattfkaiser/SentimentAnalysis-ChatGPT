So far it's done great making programs for me that any college level programmer could in 10 minutes flat. 

The rest of the time I struggled more with explaining what I wanted, and how I wanted it to work than anything else. I am not skilled enough to know how to do what I need done, and not skilled enough to adequately explain the specifics of how it should work because....I am not skilled, that is why I am using ChatGPT.  

Were I to ask an actual programmer they'd probably get the gist of where I am going a lot quicker. Hence why you pay them the big bucks and hence why they aren't going to be replaced any time soon.

I'd love to see some manager who has 0 programming experience sit there arguing with ChatGPT on what he wants done when he has no idea how programming even works.
