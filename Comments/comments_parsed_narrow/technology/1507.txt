As someone still in Uni, I’d like to go there for the passion of studying, really I would. But with an endless stream of graded projects and exams thrown at me that condition wether I will be able to do the job I want later, I don’t have the energy nor the will to truly absorb what I am being taught, especially when the program is extremely weird with more than half of the courses being actually irrelevant for my future endeavors.

That said, I still wouldn’t use chatGPT to do my work, it would just feel wrong.
