I'm not saying you're wrong but the cost to using ChatGPT isn't just the $2K fee, it's also the time it takes to train employees to use the system. Not just to use it but use it properly with respect to data security. Does ChatGPT store what users feed it? They say no if you use the API...that means you have to educate your users on how the API differs from the web interface. Otherwise, you may have a mess to cleanup when someone accidentally feeds your proprietary data into ChatGPT web interface.
