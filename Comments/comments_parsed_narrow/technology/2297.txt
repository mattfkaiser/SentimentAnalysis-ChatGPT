I've been using ChatGPT for my work and, frankly, I don't get how it can be used for cheating. I treat it as a research assistant in that I ask it for ideas in the form of questions; not to give me content that I'll use as answers. 

Do people actually just copy the content and present it as their own work? I think this is more about the school system and less about the tool.
