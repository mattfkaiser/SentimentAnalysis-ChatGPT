Old ass Teacher here:

If you ask students to write explanations and not entire essays, this program isn't a problem. 

I have students complete essays one part at a time, and document their progress through the parts. 

Outline - in person feedback and direction 

Research - In person feedback and direction

Rough draft - I grade on a rubric

Peer feedback - written comments on each other's docs

Final draft - I grade more harshly on the same rubric as the rough draft 


The only people ChatGPT screws over are the people who assign essays and then walk away, or who don't build in feedback at each step.
