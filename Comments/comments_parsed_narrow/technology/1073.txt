I asked chatgpt to summarize this


>The modern essay originated with Michel de Montaigne, who developed the essai to see the world anew, rotated an idea, scrutinised it from all sides, and sought fresh insight. However, the industrialisation of the academic essay has created a crisis in formal education because there is an undue focus on convergent thinking. The college essay should involve divergent thinking, which is an important precursor to creative work. Unfortunately, software like ChatGPT is not good at divergent thinking, but it can mimic the glib, bloodless prose that characterises so much academic writing. An engaged academic could return the essay to its proper Montaignian heritage, a divergent and creative exploration of possibilities, by overhauling the system and promoting student-to-teacher ratios.
