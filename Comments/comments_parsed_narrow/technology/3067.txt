Honestly, I feel like we should be embracing modern tools rather than trying to stomp them out. Instead of asking your students to write an essay, ask chatGPT to write one, and then have your students review that essay, edit it, and improve it. If they were asked to provide an essay about something in a real job, and used chatGPT to do it, nobody would have any problems with that as long as it's a good essay. We should teach them to leverage those tools, not to compete with them.
