The other thing is human intelligence and self awareness. We don’t understand that either. 

In many ways human intelligence and reasoning is as “dumb” as chatGPT from the logic level.

It’s all just reacting to scenarios, “predicting” what will give us the best outcome.

There are very good examples in neuroscience of free will that show that our brain makes the reactionary action first and then our self awareness comes in after the event.

It is very likely that our “general intelligence” is based on a much simpler algorithm than many would believe. 

AI don’t need self awareness or free will to start making an impact. In some cases it just needs the right environment. 

In the same way AI does not need to be self replicate. Or self improve its code. Through its symbiosis with humans it will 100% get replicated and manually patched with AI made code by humans until it becomes able to do it itself.

Now it’s reached the stage where it can self improve its code but needs human manual upgrades to make it active.

The flywheel of AI is in full motion. There is almost no way to stop it from becoming self improving and more independent. Still just as a language model…
