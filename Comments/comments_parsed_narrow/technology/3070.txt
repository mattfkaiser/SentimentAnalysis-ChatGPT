Chatgpt is incapable of judgement or of reassessing the opinions it finds on the internet.  I found it easy to lead ChatGPT into a loop of logic where it proved its own initial statement wrong - but then insisted it's initial statement was correct.

ChatGPT has a long way to go before I consider it "intelligent".
