It's crazy that people defend this. Chat GPT uses the data of its conversations to improve its learning learning model. Sure, they may be using your data specifically to see what you personally have been saying to it, in order to possibly build a personality type around you as an individual, combined with 'usage reasons', and 'conversation topics', to help create a more well rounded AI bot that can then seek out these personality types and respond accordingly. 

The EU kicking up a fuss about GDPR isn't necessary here. If I'm talking to chat GPT I'm assuming all my info is going back to google just like same thing here using reddit. Me, my device, my cookies transferred across different apps and whatever else info they have.

What GDPR should be doing, is stopping whatsapp selling my phone number to scammers so my phone isn't constantly calling with ppl from India trying to get me to buy google play cards that they can sell the codes for lol, my data on the services I use I already assume to have lost immediately when I give it, don't we all assume this? 

The EU is out of touch with technology, if it's saying that Chat GPT will be banned EU wide because they're using too much identifying information which isn't fit for purpose, this just hurts the citizens of the EU, because you already assume all of the info about you is on there anyway.

Same thing with the cookies and having to annoyingly click accept. Nobody gives a fuck everybody just clicks accept and it's just an annoying EU law which has made this the reality. 

Big government bodies like the EU sticking their noses in where they don't belong is frustrating and that's what this is.
