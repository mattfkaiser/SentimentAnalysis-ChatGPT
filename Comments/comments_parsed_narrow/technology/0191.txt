Which honestly seems perfectly fine... **IF** OpenAI is held legally responsible for any damages.

If this were to actually happen, they would easily lose in court.

**The real problem is more nefarious.** It's not going to be identity theft or anything so cut-and-dry like that. It's going to be bits and pieces of everyone's personal information. And it's going to be *inferences* that bad actors can make, based on the outputs of the model, rather than ChatGPT explicitly "revealing" these secrets in complete sentences. Ditto for IP theft.

This is why it's so important to regulate these issues *before* they show up in court -- the most problematic stuff isn't *going* to come up in court because it'll be virtually untraceable.
