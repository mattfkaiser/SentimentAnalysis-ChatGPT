I would argue that people consuming content has not changed, what changes is the kickback (0 exposure 0 money as you said) that the original content creator gets because ChatGPT doesn’t cite it’s sources.

And once the problem in the feedback loop is correctly reframed as “content creators not getting recognition” rather than “people not consuming content”, then we can see that it’s an age old problem and not a new one created by the advent of ChatGPT.
