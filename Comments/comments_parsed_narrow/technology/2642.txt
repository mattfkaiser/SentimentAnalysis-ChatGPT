this really isn't an apt analogy

The cited professor isn't generalizing that AI won't be impactful, in fact it is their field of study

But they're entirely right that ChatGPT doesn't warrant the panic it's stirring. A _lot_ of folks are projecting intelligence onto GPT that it is entirely devoid of, and not some matter of incremental improvement away from

An actually intelligent assistant would be as much a quantum leap from ChatGPT as it would be from what we had before ChatGPT

"bullshit generator" is a spot on description. And it will keep becoming an incrementally better bullshit generator. And if your job is generating bullshit copy you might be in trouble (sorry buzzfeed layoffs). For everyone else, you might need to worry at some point but ChatGPT's introduction is not it, and there's no reason to believe we're any closer to general AI than we were before
