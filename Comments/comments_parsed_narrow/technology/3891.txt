At a certain point it’s cheating. We’re not saying don’t embrace new technologies but has no one in this fucking comment section heard of the phrase “walk before you run”. How about we force the fundamentals before letting them just use chatGPT for everything. 


It’s no different than with calculators. We learn the basics of math THEN give them a calculator for things like stats and calculus.
