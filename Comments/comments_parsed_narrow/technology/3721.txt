I had to help my wife write up some blog post one time. Never had done it in my life. I do, however, have extensive writing skills from the ridiculous amounts of papers I had to write in college. So I basically treated it as a research paper peppering in the SEO terms and such. If ChatGPT was around when I did that; I wouldâ€™ve used that to pump it out for me.

There are a lot of things ChatGPT cannot do, but making up texts it is really good at.
