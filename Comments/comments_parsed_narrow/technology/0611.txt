As a self taught backend developer currently working with angular (the primary front end guy on the project quit early on) chatGPT has made the transition easier. It was basically sprung on me that I would be doing front-end instead without any time to start prepping. I've learned so much in such a short amount of time and the responses I get are filled with information I can use to Google or search the angular documentation later. I'm tired of trying to find the "right" stack overflow that is close enough to my exact problem, trying to read tons of documentation because the getting started isn't enough, or sift through medium articles. Like let me just tell this thing what I'm trying to do and have it break down the steps and reasoning behind it. I can do more research from there. Blindly copy pasting ai generated code is obviously dumb, and so is claiming that this isn't going to be a huge game changer for the average developer.
