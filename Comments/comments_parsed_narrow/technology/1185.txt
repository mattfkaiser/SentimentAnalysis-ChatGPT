Yeah I've been using ChatGPT a lot lately and I immediately recognized that this comment was AI generated.

That's the catch, you can't just put a prompt into ChatGPT and then immediately turn it in as a finished paper. You have to re-write the ChatGPT output to fit your own writing style. And at that point I don't see how ChatGPT is much different from traditional research (as long as you're fact checking and collecting sources on any information that ChatGPT uses).

It's powerful, and it reduces the amount of time that a student would need to write a paper, but aren't these good things?

AI art is very similar. It's great for ideas and to get you started but you're still going to need a bit of art talent to get to a finished product.
