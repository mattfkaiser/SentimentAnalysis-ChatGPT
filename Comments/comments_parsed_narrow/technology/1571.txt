You might try asking it again with different phrasing.  A co- worker and I were able to get ChatGPT to return a functioning powershell script when we were very specific about what we wanted: “Write a PowerShell script that returns all user accounts whose password will expire within 17 days.”

Did it “generate” the script?  Don’t know, don’t care.

It got the job done just like calling a bunch of code libraries, changing strings and variables does.
