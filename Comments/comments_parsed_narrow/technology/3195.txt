Again, it isn’t “stupid” if it’s been effective at doing what it was intended to do for literally years now.. 

There being other methods is irrelevant here. Captchas aren’t really stupid, that’s just you trying to frame them as such, now that AI has found a way around one. It’s also worth noting that ChatGPT still couldn’t pass the Captcha directly. It basically had to think of a creative Hail Mary strategy. So if even our most advanced AI’s still can’t pass them (despite those same AIs being able to pass the fucking BAR exam…) How “stupid” are they really?
