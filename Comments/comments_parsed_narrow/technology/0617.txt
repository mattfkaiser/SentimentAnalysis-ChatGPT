You are right about machine learning algorithms, which use trial and error, to simulate 100 years of experience doing something simple in say 10 days instead of 100 years. 

But if you are talking about artificial intelligence, then you are basing your search results on what is popularly said in the data sets. If most of the data is wrong, then it will suggest the wrong answer, or make up an answer. Artificial intelligence is only as smart as we teach it to be with the data we give it.

Now if there is a combination of machine learning to verify artificial intelligence’s findings, and at fast speed and vast scale, then we really have something special.

But because most complex systems are way more complex than what simple machine learning algorithms are trained on, it could still take 100 years for a mega AI/ ML being to be able to interpret data, verify data, and then at that point, implement the findings.

Because a lot of AI’s secret sauce is behind closed doors, it can’t explain or show it’s work yet completely. 

Once experts can verify the steps that ai takes, confirms the findings, then we can really keep accelerating AI/ ML to be accurate with its findings and way of thinking.

I’m trying to experiment with bing and chatgpt integration for my really complex tasks, but the mindset to create the prompts and even describe the problem that you are trying to solve is the missing human link, where all knowledge comes together. 

It’s easy to say what you want, the hard part is figuring out how to get the there!
