I think if you give it a prompt to writ ea legal argument with a specific viewpoint it might do better, not just giving it a question with a right or wrong answer. I just tried giving ChatGPT a prompt of the ongoing Supreme Court case Garland v. Gonzalez, and asked it to come up with a legal argument siding with the government's view (after summarizing the government's argument in the prompt). I'm not a lawyer by any means so maybe there are parts of this that are complete BS but at first glance it doesn't look totally unreasonable:

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that the government must provide fair and impartial proceedings before depriving an individual of life, liberty, or property. However, the Supreme Court has held that the nature and amount of process due in immigration proceedings depends on the specific circumstances and context of each case. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976).

In the context of immigration detention, the government may argue that paper file reviews, which are periodic reviews of the individual's case and detention status, are sufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause. The government may argue that these file reviews provide a reasonable opportunity for the individual to challenge their detention and present evidence in their favor. The government may also argue that immigration proceedings can take a significant amount of time, and that the interests of the government in maintaining immigration control and national security justify the use of detention as a means of ensuring that individuals attend their immigration proceedings.

This argument would emphasize the deference given to the government in immigration matters and the balancing of individual liberty against the government's interests in immigration control and national security. The argument would also assert that paper file reviews provide sufficient process to ensure that detention is fair and impartial, and that the Due Process Clause does not require a bond hearing in all cases.
