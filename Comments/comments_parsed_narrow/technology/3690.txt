I think one big strength could be if ChatGPT could become a tool for dealing with a lot of mundane office tasks. 

Someone brought up the notion of using it to help in creating job descriptions and responding to applicants. Imagine now if every single resume sent could get a decently personalized response.

I know some might not want to see it, but I would even love to see the AI go to the point of looking at your resume and then sending back up a light rejection, but also the points that they felt were weak compared to what the company wanted.  

Something of real feedback so people can pivot and try to adjust and learn and grow so they can possibly get more success.
