I showed it to my friends a few weeks back.

One is dyslexic and loves it because it is excellent at correcting errors in what they write.

The other tried simply telling it "assume I have severe ADHD" and it fluidly started writing text in a different style she found much easier to concentrate on and parse.

Turns out there are guides to writing text for people with different problems and chatgpt knows how and can switch as fluidly as it can talk like a pirate.

Now she runs any dense text she needs to parse through it.

This shit is going to be a **huge** deal for people with various mild disabilities and I'm betting employers HR depts will start to realise the implications of blanket bans.
