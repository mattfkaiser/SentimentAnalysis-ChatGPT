People who can write well are unicorns and worth their weight in gold.  ChatGPT can create competent prose, but it has a voice and tone that grate on me.

It’s fine for what it is. But it isn’t a replacement for all writing and writers — not by any stretch of the imagination.

I’ve used it to generate some ideas. It’s often great for that. But when you take a closer look, the ideas are general in nature. Sometimes that’s fine. If you ask for a marketing plan, for instance, it will be general, marketing 101 stuff. Follow-up answers to prompts can make it stronger, but it’s not creative. 

I do like how it will create the outline for certain materials. That can help with organizing my thoughts or get me thinking about another direction.

It also is good for the first draft of cover letters. I’m not looking for a job. But when I was, I hated writing cover letters with a passion. Its cover letters suffer from the same problem with generalities, but it is an excellent start that can be made better by hand.
