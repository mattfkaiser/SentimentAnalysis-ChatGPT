There’s such a wide variety of pessimism, optimism, and skepticism around the future of this technology. Just look at the comments in this thread. It’s crazy. I would consider myself cautiously optimistic, but emphasis on the cautious part. These are the two biggest concerns for me:

- **Corporations are greedy** - decisions are made by middle management and executives who just want to grow revenue and reduce expenses. They don’t care about the long term future of the company and they sure as shit don’t care about employees. They just care about their bottom line, getting their numbers up so they can cash out and move on to the next company. If there was a way for them to automate a ton of jobs they definitely will. People say “Well ChatGPT is very mediocre at best, there’s no way it can program like me.” Companies thrive on mediocrity. They amass tons of tech debt by constantly launching new features and deprioritizing work that keeps systems running efficiently. If all the tech implodes 4 years later from shitty code written by AI for pennies on the dollar, they don’t care, as they’re already on to the next big payday at another company.

- **Our politicians will not be able to help us** - Let’s say that we do see a big upswing in jobs being replaced by AI. The goons in Washington are so technologically illiterate, they would have no idea how to regulate this kind of technology. Remember when Zuck got grilled by Congress, and we found out just how out of touch with technology our leaders are? They couldn’t even grasp at how Facebook made money: people willingly give their information to the platform who packages it up and sells it to advertisers. Simple, right? Imagine the same goons trying to figure out how AI/ML works, arguably one of the most complex subjects in technology. By time they had enough of a basic understanding of the tech to regulate it, it would have already grown leaps and bounds. Washington can’t keep up.

It may not be good enough to replace jobs right now. It might be awhile before it can, if at all. Hopefully it just makes people’s jobs easier. If people’s jobs are easier, they’ll get paid less to do them. I just don’t have enough faith in the people that make the decisions to do the right thing but I’ve been wrong before so I hope I am wrong this time too.
