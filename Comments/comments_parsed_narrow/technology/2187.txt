I’ve actually used ChatGPT3 to see what kind of answer it’ll give as opposed to mine and it did basically give the same answer but had way more detail so I took the detail word for word and turned it in. I know this tech won’t be free to use forever so I wanted to see if they’d come back with you used openAI or not and no one said anything and the paper got full credit. Some clever professor MIGHT be able to deduce the writing style as possibly Ai generated due to the uniformity but there’s zero ways for them to replicate your exact output as every single reply is unique. It’s definitely possible to cheat and not get caught for now
