Because it's a piece of software, it's not conscious. ChatGPT didn't actually understand how a chili recipe works, it just draws connections between words it frequently sees together. When a human creates a new recipe based on recipes they have seen before, they are thinking about the ingredients, how they might interact and what flavor they are going for. GPT doesn't do that, it doesn't even know what chili is.
