Yeah, if you just copy whatever the AI spits out, then you're probably going to have a bad time, no matter what essay prompt the teacher gives you. But I just tried both of those prompts, and ChatGPT gives you *a lot* to work with in either instance. 

You do obviously have to tweak the prompt a bit for the one about how something has impacted *your* life. But an incredibly basic description of who you are will give you a great starting-off point. For example, the prompt that I gave it was: “write an essay about how changes to American society in the anti bellum South have impacted the lives of white, middle class Americans living today.” 

And, you can easily take points ChatGPT makes in its original result, and feed them back to the AI, in order to get it to expound on topics that you think would be interesting in your essay. 

Its not the mindless process of simply pasting a prompt into the text box, verbatim, and then wholesale copying the output as your essay. But there's no comparison between the speed and ease at which I could put together a decent essay by relying heavily on ChatGPT vs not using it at all.
