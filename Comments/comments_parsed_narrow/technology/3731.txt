Looks like they deleted their tweets in shame. Some guy responded to a tweet about an interview between Josef Stalin and HG Wells, saying the interview never happened. When asked WTF he was talking about, he said he asked ChatGPT and it said there was never an interview between the two, and he provided a screenshot of ChatGPT saying as much. He was dragged for using ChatGPT as a source.
