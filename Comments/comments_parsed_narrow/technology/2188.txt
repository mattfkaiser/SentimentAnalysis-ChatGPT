Just quit school altogether and use ChatGPT to write yourself a resume. Just fake it until you make it. Become that certain someone at work who doesn't know crap about the job and still got paid by either 1. bossing everyone around or 2. always be the victim and feed on others' pity 3. act like you're learning but in reality you are not 4. kiss up to your boss 5. have sex with your co-workers and/or boss

All sarcasm, of course. If I hit a nail, I apologize. Nah.
