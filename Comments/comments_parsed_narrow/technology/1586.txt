I wonder how much it depends on years of discussion forum questions and answers by users versus official technical documentation that's accessible online.  If it's more the former than the latter,  what happens when many thousands of people are no longer asking questions on public discussion boards because they're using ChatGPT? Doesn't its effectiveness partly depend on both novices and experts NOT using it so that new questions and answers can be learned?
