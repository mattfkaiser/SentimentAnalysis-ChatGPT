From the article:

>Altman said under the way the proposed law is currently drafted, both   
ChatGPT and the large language model GPT-4 could be designated   
high-risk. This would require the company to comply with certain   
requirements. According to Time,  
 the OpenAI CEO said “If we can comply, we will, and if we can’t, we’ll   
cease operating… We will try. But there are technical limits to what’s   
possible.”

Not quite as grabby as the headline
