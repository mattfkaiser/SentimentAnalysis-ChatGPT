While GPT3.5 (ChatGPT) is certainly one of the, if not the best LLM out there, there are plenty of open source models already, some small some large, some easily runnable on your home hardware, some require a massive GPU cluster. Some small models can perform at the level of giant models for certain tasks, with the right tricks. Optimization such as int4 quantization allows for large models to much easier to operate, etc. You'll have your own ChatGPT in your pocket in no time, even if the state-of-the-art will be run on giant GPU systems in the cloud, some behind an API only.
