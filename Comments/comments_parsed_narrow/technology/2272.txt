>The part I don't understand is writing a paper about it because the real life application of that is very niche and unless that's a field that you're interesting in pursuing. But that's more of an education problem rather than a chatgpt thing.

You're still misunderstanding the point of writing school papers. At most grade levels, it isn't about trying to turn the students into experts in the subject of any particular paper or training them to be academics in that field.

As for the rest of it, let's just say I'm not impressed. The fact that ChatGPT was able to pass a law school exam, just barely, says more about the dumbing down of American higher education than it does the intelligence of ChatGPT. From what I've seen, it isn't able to reach new or surprising conclusions about anything. It just repackages and regurgitates in easily digestible form information that others – humans – have already discovered and vetted.

Not sure why you're so excited about what you expect will be the replacement of human intellectual endeavor with machine intelligence, or why anyone would be, but I guess that's for you to ponder.
