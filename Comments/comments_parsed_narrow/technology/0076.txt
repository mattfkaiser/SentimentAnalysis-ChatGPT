I tried to use chatgpt to write an abstract for a paper because I couldn't come up with any ideas to start it. I requested the sources and it listed them all.

Every single source was made up.

I told it that the sources were all wrong and it made "corrections" by adjusting the source websites/dois. They were still all wrong. Nor could I find the sources by searching Google scholar for the titles. This article is only surprising in that the lawyer didn't try to confirm any of the cases beyond asking chatgpt if they were real.
