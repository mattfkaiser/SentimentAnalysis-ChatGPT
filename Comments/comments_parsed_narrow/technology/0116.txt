I'm a teacher in mathematics, so chatgpt isn't really that much of a problem yet. It does very well on extremely standardized questions, but not at conceptual questions. 

The way my students have cheated is they take a picture of the test, send it to someone good at maths (or using an app solver) who then sends back pictures of solutions. 

The key thing for me though is I don't have to prove it. Their grades are based on my judgment. I do not have to prove cheating or how they did it to fail them. I can simply ask a follow up question in person (which they refuse, or they've 'forgotten') and say hey, looks like you don't know this stuff after all.

It would be nice to catch them cheating, and I'm curious on how exactly they do it. Probably just a cellphone in the lap. But to fail them, I don't need it.
