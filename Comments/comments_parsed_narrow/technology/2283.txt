I once thought the same thing, but i also keep coming back to the same problem: so much of what we know is based on the precise, thorough, and specific research published by others. 

I personally think of large language models like chatgpt as language calculators that will make us all more efficient.  I mean, imagine the number of people with brilliant ideas who aren't capable of writing robust arguments to support those ideas who get ignored regularly but could get greater attention towards those brilliant ideas. To imply that being able to produce longer, academic writing isn't useful outside of academia is a narrow view. Yes, for most, writing a more concise document is better, but I think it's really important in our modern political climate to acknowledge how important academic writing is and the skills that enable it are.
