I dont see how in-class exams are bad? Every MINT program will be 90% in class exams and even my management program was 100% based on in-class exams. And have fun writing an actual bachelor or master thesis with chat gpt. I don't see how it will handle a thorough literature research or make interviews in a case study and everything that's a bit practical is also not feasible right now.   
So I don't really get where this fear is coming from? My school education was also build nearly completely on in-class exams and presentations.
