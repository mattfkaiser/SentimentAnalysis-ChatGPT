>Itâ€™s like putting your employees on Aderall- the goal is to give productive employees GPT as a tool and allow them to produce 20 hours of work in an 8 hours span

And this is what kills it for me. You hear about people who have been ahead of the curve taking advantage of chat GPT to do their work in 1/4 of the time and then take on 3 full time jobs at once for some hefty income. But employers are going to catch on and this will become the norm. Eventually workers won't get any benefit. We'll be expected to be at least 3x as productive as we used to be all while still working 8+ hour days, 40+ hour weeks, for the same salary we had before. The real winners will be the ones at the top as always.
