High school teacher here.

I have been playing around with ChatGPT since December. It has a lot of potential as a tool for teachers. I have 200 students and it is difficult to give individual feedback with so many students. Depending on the activity, ChatGPT can provide useful feedback that students can build from.

At this point, I think a lot of these articles are just creating a Streisand effect. I decided to talk to my students about ChatGPT because I was assigning an essay and I wanted to be proactive in warning against its dishonest use. Out of 200 students, not even 10 had any idea what ChatGPT was. 

Personally, I still think this was the correct approach. They may not know about it now but they will eventually. What my students know is that I am aware of ChatGPT, and I am familiar with what its output looks like. That is likely to be more effective than just banning it.
