On the other hand, I am a systems engineer and for the past month I've been keeping a tab of ChatGPT up at all times. I use it daily when I work and it has been a massive help. Where I'd normally be scrolling through tabs of stack overflow or Reddit threads for people working on a similar project as me, I toss a simple prompt into ChatGPT and can build from that when needing to build some script or automate a process. Even simple questions I toss into ChatGPT because it gets right to the point and I don't have to bother structuring my Google search properly to look up all the right terms, not show results for other terms, only show results from specific websites, etc. Setting up a new Azure tenant at work and I've had more success with it answering my questions than the consultants we brought on to help.
