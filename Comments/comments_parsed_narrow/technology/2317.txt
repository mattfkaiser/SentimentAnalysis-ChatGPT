I mean in general, cheating doesn't matter because everyone cheats in life somewhere to get ahead (you cannot solely get through life without cutting a few corners here and there).

But the big issue is whether students are actually learning or not. If they're just inputting ChatGPT responses but have no base understanding of whatever subjects they're 'cheating' in, that's the biggest issue. Students being unable to understand what it is they're being shown/taught is something professor's will have a far more difficult time handling.

Even as the current generation grows up with access to a vast amount of tech for a multitude of purposes, it doesn't help if they can't even understand basic knowledge on various subjects, or if they lack the understanding to use the basics of said tech (e.g. you can learn to use smartphones and access the internet, but can you figure out what File Explorer is on a computer, and where your programs, downloads and saved files go?).
