One day, but it's not imminent.  Someone with no knowledge of coding can't go into ChatGPT and just ask it to write a complex program.  You, as the human entering prompts, still needs to have enough knowledge to know *what* to ask for because it will only output exactly what is asked.  And you still need to know enough that you can review the code to find out why it doesn't work. It also won't write any extra code to cover things you didn't specifically ask of it like security or error checks.
