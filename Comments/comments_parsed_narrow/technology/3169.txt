From [OpenAI themselves](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq):

>**How does OpenAI use my personal data?**   
>  
>Our large language models are trained on a broad corpus of text that includes publicly available content, licensed content, and content generated by human reviewers. We don’t use data for selling our services, advertising, or building profiles of people—we use data to make our models more helpful for people. **ChatGPT, for instance, improves by further training on the conversations people have with it, unless you choose to disable training.**

However, you can't even disable this on mobile (yet).

>**Can I disable history & training on mobile?**   
>  
>At this time, history & **training can only be disabled on web.** We're hoping to add mobile support soon.
