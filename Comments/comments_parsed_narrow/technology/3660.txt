If you think it's BS, then that's fine but then you have a gross misunderstanding of what programming is. Programming isn't writing code, it's being able to break down a problem into its smallest constituents and then solving each of those algorithmically until the entire problem is solved. That is where ChatGPT struggles immensely. Logic and mathematics are it's two weak points in my anecdotal experience.
