It is certainly possible to build an app that can detect if a given essay was written by ChatGPT or another AI language model. ChatGPT is a language model that has been trained on a large dataset of text and can generate human-like text when given a prompt. However, detecting whether an essay was written by ChatGPT or another AI language model would likely involve analyzing the style, syntax, and content of the essay to see if it matches the characteristics of text generated by AI language models. This could be done using machine learning algorithms or other text analysis techniques. It is important to note that detecting AI-generated text is just one aspect of combating plagiarism. Plagiarism can take many forms, and there are a variety of tools and approaches that can be used to identify and prevent it.
