I think the fact that it's literally a completely different type of product is very relevant, and that not acknowledging that will ultimately lead to further confusion. People believe a lot of incorrect stuff because it was the "simpler" answer, and then inevitably get confused when their resulting expectations don't match reality. Like there's no need to go into what exactly GPT is or how it works, it's just literally "this is not ChatGPT, this is a different kind of product".
