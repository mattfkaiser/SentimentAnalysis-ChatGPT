It shouldn't. I tried to have it write me a piece of python code for some DB stuff I had to do. Completed the code over the course of a week and forgot I asked ChatGPT for help with it. Then I spent about a day trying to debug an error in the code, only for me to realize ChatGPT had used an incorrect library, and by just following it and assuming it was the right library, I lost time I could have spent doing a different task. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Hoping these companies face the consequences of their actions.
