Yeah, but the work tasks you will be assigned are not going to always be something you are interested in either. If your boss asks you to investigate some problem, report on the issue, and give a summary and recommendations, that is a very similar task to reporting on random French philosophers. 

Those skills become immediately evident and useful as soon as you step into the job function that requires a college degree. It's part of the expectation of skills that come with that degree. 

Chat GPT can spit out bullshit about a french philosopher, but cannot reliably frame that information to be relevant to the interested party. That is the actual human skill that you are hopefully being trained for.
