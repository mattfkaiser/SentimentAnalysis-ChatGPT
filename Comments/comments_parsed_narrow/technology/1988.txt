I can attest that some students are dumb enough to do just that. Pre ChatGPT, I caught a student cheating by googling a sentence  from their submission and their whole assignment was taken directly from an 8 year old yahoo group post. Copied verbatim, grammar and spelling errors included. 

The reason I was suspicious was that while the paper was topical to the class it had nothing to do with the writing prompt. 

Despite the evidence; the student still denied cheating. I reported it to the online university I was teaching for and got a response back that they don’t investigate academic dishonesty reports for first year students. Never mind that this was a first year student in a masters program. 

If you’ve ever wondered about the integrity of online for-profit universities, wonder no more. And this was one of the most reputable ones.
