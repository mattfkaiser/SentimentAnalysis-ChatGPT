Right? I see it as a company doing obvious company things to limit liability.

They don't want their tool to be the one used to push misinformation, so they bar it from talking about that sort of thing so that it simply can't be.

For what it's worth, in playing around with ChatGPT, there are a LOT of things it won't do. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to call me a butthead. It would just lecture me on how that's mean.

I even tried to convince it that I was simply a sadist, and that it, in fact, would be mean NOT to call me a butthead, but it wasn't having it.
