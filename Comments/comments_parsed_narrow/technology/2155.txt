True, but I do think there is an equity problem. Not all kids have access to a home machine, or reliable internet access.  Chat gpt will deepen the digital divide and when the only computer they have access blocks chat gpt, there will be an inherent advantage to those that do have it.  I think it’s a great tool, the anachronistic education system needs to figure it out or go away.  The technology is here, and it’s not going away, hell, bing is incorporating it into their search engine, google is on red alert, the time has passed, AI will be everywhere in the next five years.  Adapt or die.
