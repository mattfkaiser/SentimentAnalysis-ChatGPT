The dissonance is being created because the school system instills a curriculum that isn't useful in 'real life'. The kids know this, and just want to. get through the slog of their education as quickly as possible so they can get to the part that really matters most - making money. 

Making money is the conduit that gets them the Instagram life they really want - and I'm willing to bet that if standardized education focused more on money-getting (e.g. learning business acumen, financial literacy) from a foundational level, you'd find more kids buying in because it is directly tied to their future. 

We've entered an age where you can monetize yourself and no longer have a need for an employer - and the kids know this. That's why ChatGPT is so important, because it's the anchor to changing what's important to people.
