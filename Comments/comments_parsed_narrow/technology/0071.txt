It's also comical because folks tend to give it really common tasks and then act amazed it did them. Good chance ChatGPT was even trained on that task in its immense training dataset. Humans are *really* bad at randomness, and you can even see patterns in thought processes across different people: [when asked for a random number between 1-10, seven is massively overrepresented](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/acow6y/asking_over_8500_students_to_pick_a_random_number/). If you could similarly quantify the tasks that people ask ChatGPT to code when they first encounter it, I'd guess they heavily collapse into a handful of categories with some minor differences with the specifics.

Any time I've taken effort to give it a more novel problem, it falls flat on its face. I tried giving it a real-world problem I had just coded up the other day, (roughly speaking) extract some formatted information from Markdown files and transform it, and it was a mess. Tried to use a CLI-only package as a library with an API, etc. After going around 5 times or so pointing out where it was wrong and trying to get it to correct itself, I gave up.
