I think we need to stop being upset that people don't read articles. That's how Reddit works, because that's how *people* work. We're not going to change things.

Instead, submitters need to rewrite headlines so people get the essential info right up front (and to nullify clickbait). This one should be rewritten as "Germany considers following Italy in banning ChatGPT due to breach of EU privacy laws".
