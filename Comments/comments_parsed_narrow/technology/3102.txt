I really wish there was a more accurate way to describe AI. Its not independent, ChatGPT is a prediction model with a user interface. We are a long ways off from building true AI. The problem with regulating it now is very few people on politics have the technical knowledge, familiarity or interest to really understand what they are regulating.  So it's going to turn into a shitshow of blowhards either claiming its skynet or that it will get out of their control like social media did.
