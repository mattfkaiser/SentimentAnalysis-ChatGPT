I have a complex work presentation this Monday. And this is on top of my daily duties. So I figured... I guess I'll have to work for free this weekend doing my research for my presentation.

Oh my world.

I literally asked three questions to ChatGPT regarding the subject I needed to research. A really obscure subject that I tried during the week to investigate using the NHI library and some other academic and industry resources. 

The result from Chat was an almost perfectly finished product. It needs some references and verifications, but saved me I guess about 20 human hours of work. 

Just insane.
