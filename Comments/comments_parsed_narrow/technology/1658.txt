Someone is programing it to be a certain way. I tried to get ChatGPT to write me a short horror story about Helen Keller. It refused. Straight up said she was a magnificent women and it couldn't write that. I tried many different ways, different types of stories. Wouldn't do it. Everything came back that it wouldn't say anything bad about her.

This is clearly someone putting some bias in the algorithm. This actually did alarm me a bit, because nobody should be able to do that.
