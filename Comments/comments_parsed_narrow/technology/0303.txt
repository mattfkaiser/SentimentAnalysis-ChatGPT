This hype is getting to conman level, this is the "[product] beats index funds" moment using selective windows. This is guaranteed long term to not be true, one bad stock and you can't match the top that are already heavily algorithmic driven and selective.

> Between March 6 and April 28, a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks gained 4.9 per cent while 10 leading investment funds clocked an average loss of 0.8 per cent, according to an experiment conducted by financial comparison site finder.com.

> It wouldn't "be long until large numbers of consumers try to use [ChatGPT] for financial gain," Jon Ostler, Finder's CEO, said in a statement earlier this week.


> Over the same eight-week period, the S&P 500 index, which tracks the 500 most valuable companies in the United States, rose 3 per cent. Europe's equivalent, the Stoxx Europe 600 index, ticked up 0.5 per cent in that time.

There might be some small windows where it will beat, but you can't beat just getting the top stocks all the time that are in index funds. You might beat it here and there, but you'll also lose here and there and that will bring it under index funds performance.
