# Boom. Smoking gun.

All chatGPT does is put light on this fact. The only possible way that chatGPT is an issue is if the education system measures grades, not learning. 

With an education system built to learn, chatGPT literally ***cannot be an issue in this environment.***

Honestly, I'm looking at this as a good thing. It's a good thing because the ONLY possible permanent fix to this is to restructure the education system, which it has long needed.

Of course, someone will come up with a temporary resolution of creating an AI to spot AI generated stuff, but that would just be a bandaid as this stuff gets more complex.
