The prof sent a mail to everyone about the so-called fraud.

Someone actually sent a cease and desist to the prof for sending a fraudulent mail (that someone claimed THEY originally wrote the email the prof sent, and they had proof, because ChatGPT said _they_ wrote the email, and not the prof!)

In other words: Someone did the exact same the prof did to the students.
