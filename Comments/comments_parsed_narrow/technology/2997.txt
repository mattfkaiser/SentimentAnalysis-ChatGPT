Basically, the guy formed his opinion and then used ChatGPT to extend it in the summary which the summary was included and cited.  That would be similar to our exchange that has been going on, I would state my opinion on the matter then used ChatGPT to expand upon the exchange in summary.  Give it a /r/science article then use it to formulate a summary for the abstract to be used in addition to the author's summary of the study in the abstract.
