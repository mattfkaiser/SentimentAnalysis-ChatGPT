A friend of mine is a TA and said the papers she's graded that are written by chatgpt are very obvious. They tend to repeat points and confidently state misinformation. It seems to be left out of discussions that chatgpt is *really* bad at identifying the difference between a reliable source and a blog post. 

It is, however, really good at improving Grammer and sentence structure of an already written paper, which I think is a much fairer use.
