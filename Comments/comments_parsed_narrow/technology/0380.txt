> as an experiment I found a pair of Earth Sciences college courses at Princeton University, and asked ChatGPT to write essays that I could ostensibly hand in as coursework. I then emailed the results for each to the professors teaching those courses.

> As well as the aforementioned Earth Sciences essays, I also gave this prompt to ChatGPT, for an essay I could share with the lecturers at Hofstra...  Again, ChatGPT obliged, and I sent the resulting essay to the Dean of Journalism.

What a dick move. Professors (and especially Deans) have so many things to do other than read some randos essay.

> As I write this, none of the professors at Princeton or Hofstra have commented on my ChatGPT essays. Perhaps it's because they're all on spring break. **It might also be that they read the essays, and were too shocked and horrified to respond.**

Or it might also be because you're not a student, you're not in the class, and there is zero upside to responding to you.
