Here's one example of something I consider pretty disruptive related LLM adoption. A $3 billion company in China is swapping out their creative teams with an LLM. We'll see how it turns out and whether it was a good idea, but one can't deny that all those people lost those jobs and won't get them back if the LLMs pay off. I personally think they will, but again, I'm just giving a singular example of the type of disruption that I'm thinking of.
