the stuff in the article is straight up incorrect also... It says chatgpt is great at "crunching numbers"? What? It is often wrong about simple arithmetic word problems lol. This article is seriously garbage, a shame too, bc there is a real discussion to be had about AI potentially replacing some white collar jobs IMO.
