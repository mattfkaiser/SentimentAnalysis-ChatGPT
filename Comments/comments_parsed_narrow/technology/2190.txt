Chat GPT has actually significantly aided my understanding of complex topics such as quantum computing and time crystals. 

The ability to ask the AI specific follow-up questions about a particular part of its previous explanation, and to receive a coherent and informative response, is incredibly helpful in attaining a deeper level of understanding. 

If Chat GPT could become a helpful tutor that explains how to get an answer, rather than the answer itself, it could be an incredible aid in education.
