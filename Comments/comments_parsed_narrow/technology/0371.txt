I was trying to use it as a search engine (which it isn't but Google scholar was getting me nowhere) where I was asking if it could find me a research paper with a specific study design. It churned out a title with a description, authors, year publish, journal and a link. The link went to some other completely different article and I couldn't find it by searching for title. The authors were all real people but when I looked through the published work the study wasn't there. I tried this multiple times and every time it appeared to just make up a study. Chatgpt isn't supposed to be used as a search engine but it appears that if you ask it something it can't do, rather than tell you, it just bullshits and makes stuff up that sounds like an answer.
