Our economy is literally measured in output, and people using AI are maximizing their output as capitalism requires. This AI hysteria is ridiculous, it's stupid to punish children for the same skills that six+ figure careers would reward them for. They should be taught how to vet information from AI and how to edit it to fit the assignment, the outright ban only cripples them in the long-term.

I also was using Jarvis before ChatGPT, and my child will be taught how to take advantage of the technology available to her.
