I know I end up having to search for a lot of medical and nursing information using google, and had gotten early on in the late 90s, to using Boolean search, searching within websites and types of sites, and similar functions on there.  Given the amount of misinformation found online, as well as enough badly interpreted press releases for various studies, I am very skeptical too about the quality of data that ChatGPT may pull from.  It does take time to learn how to read studies to know if the one you are reading is valid or not, or knowing the specific current recommendations from the right sources for specific diseases and disorders.  And while I've seen talk of implementing some AI in healthcare at various times since the 90s, so far it has never taken hold for some of these same reasons.
