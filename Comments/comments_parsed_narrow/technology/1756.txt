I just did, and here's what it answered:

Q: Who's the current CEO of Twitter?

ChatGPT:

*As of my knowledge cut-off, the CEO of Twitter was Jack Dorsey. However, I don't have the ability to know the current CEO of Twitter, since my knowledge cut-off is 2021*

EDIT: I just asked it like 5 times in a row, and finally got this:

*As of September 2021, the CEO of Twitter is Elon Musk. However, as of 2021-11-08 Jack Dorsey is the CEO of Twitter.*

Ridiculous answer obviously, however the website quite clearly states that its limited on data after 2021, so yeah dont trust any answer that involves any time period after 2021, so i still dont know what the fuss is about, the website says this is expected and it wasnt made for these questions.
