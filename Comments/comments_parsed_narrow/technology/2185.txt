Chat GPT is exposing a flaw In the way that education has been morphed into a banking system where teachers have knowledge to fill the student's minds. Education is about discovery, examination, and discussion. ChatGPT poses a unique threat to our current education system because we focus so hard on grades and pedagogical orthodoxy that we completely fail to engage the minds of students. ChatGPT is not a problem in an environment where a teacher is in dialogue with their student and determining their knowledge through dialogue and discussion. If your method of judging comprehension is subverted by such an imperfect AI, your method of judgement should be examined and refined.
