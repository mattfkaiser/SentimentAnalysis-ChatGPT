ChatGPT is a tool for writing school essays in the same way that stealing someone else’s essay from online is a tool for writing school essays. It’s pure plagiarism, because you didn’t actually write it. Someone, or something, else wrote it for you.

Now, are there situations in life when copying someone else’s work is okay? Yeah, like drafting a boilerplate legal contract. You’re typically copying prose from somewhere online, anyway, to do that. So that’s fine for ChatGPT.

But when it comes to academics, copying from ChatGPT, or from someone else… that’s plagiarism.

And when it comes to the real world, knowing how to actually write in an effective and compelling way is a pretty critical life skill. And someone who can actually write will always have a huge leg up on someone who only knows how to prompt ChatGPT.

So no, I don’t agree that someone graduating without knowing how to write is no big deal. I think that person who only plagiarized through school with the help of ChatGPT is woefully underprepared for adulthood and the job market. The same way I would feel about a student who buys their papers from someone else all through school.
