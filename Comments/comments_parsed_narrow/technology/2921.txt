ChatGPT cannot write high quality anything if you don't know whats being talked about. Seriously. Take a subject you know well and ask it to write a report on it. It'll be full of lies, misconstrued facts and logical inconsistencies. The major problem is that high school essays are full of this stuff as well. It's real hard for a teacher to tell if the nonsense paper is written by an AI which regurgitates random facts into a semi coherent essay. Or if its a 15 year old who regurgitates random facts into a semi coherent essay.
