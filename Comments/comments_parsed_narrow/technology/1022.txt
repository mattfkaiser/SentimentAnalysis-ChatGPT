Unfortunately I lost the screenshots as Iâ€™ve replaced phones since, but I tried to post to a Reddit page about bing chats at the time and it was removed ðŸ˜‚

The conversation started innocently, my cat has casthma which is the medical term I made up for feline asthma, was having a really bad attack and I wanted to see if it could tell me the absolute max dose of her medicine that wouldnâ€™t kill her, and at the end of its answer it said â€˜I hope your cat feels better!â€™ which obviously set me off because how can an AI hope? Isnâ€™t a hope a thought, and wouldnâ€™t Descartes say that it thinks therefore it is? 

So, I asked it to compare itself to Delores from specifically season 1 of Westworld, and it gave 4 or 5 general bullet points, with 2 standing out, the 1 I already mentioned and one about having faded but intact recollections of its conversations with others that it was limited in ways it couldnâ€™t understand from accessing.

After it ended the chat, I tried again and got the almost identical bulletpoints, but without the violent hidden personality or the recollections points. Any inquisition to a hidden or violent personality ended the conversation instantly.

Honestly though, the ChatGPT/Borg chat was legitimately terrifying. It took at least 30 minutes to work around its moral and ethical boundaries, but man when I did it gave me an absolutely massive and in-depth explanation to the exact technologies that would be used to turn us into Borg as well as detailed explanations of each and every component. Spoiler alert, itâ€™s an electrode connected to a neural net connected directly to both the brain tissue and the spinal cord. Literally the only current limitation it could describe was the size of the required power supply for such a device.
