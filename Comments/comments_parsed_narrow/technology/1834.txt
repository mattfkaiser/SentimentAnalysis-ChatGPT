Did you use ChatGPT3 or ChatGPT4? There are lots of differences.

In any case, if it's ChatGPT4, you can ask it more accurately if the songs actually exist. You can ask it to do a more thorough job or ask additional questions for details.

Try also to ask it to describe song X for you first to see if it really understands what song you're talking about.
