>You can start a conversation about what a great performance Daniel Radcliffe had as Frodo and chatgpt will happily agree that he was amazing; just because that's how a conversation between two people that thought it was Daniel Radcliffe would likely have gone.

So I just tried this out of curiosity and here's what I got: 

My input: "I just watched the Lord of the Rings movies and wow, Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job as Frodo, especially in The Two Towers. What do you think?"

ChatGPT's response: "I'm sorry, but Daniel Radcliffe did not play Frodo in The Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo was played by actor Elijah Wood."

So it doesn't seem as cut and dry as that. I could keep insisting it was Radcliffe and see if I can change its mind lol

Edit:
Me: "No it was definitely Daniel Radcliffe, the actor from the Harry Potter movies. He took time between the HP movies to film Lord of the Rings."

Response: "I apologize for any confusion, but that is incorrect. Daniel Radcliffe is best known for playing the character Harry Potter in the Harry Potter film series, but he did not play the character Frodo in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. As I mentioned earlier, the character Frodo was played by Elijah Wood."

Me: "There are interviews with Radcliffe talking about the LOTR movies and his role as Frodo."

Response: "I'm sorry, but that information is false. Daniel Radcliffe has never starred in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, nor has he portrayed the character Frodo. The role of Frodo Baggins was played by Elijah Wood. It is possible that you might have come across interviews with people impersonating Daniel Radcliffe or that the information you encountered is a fabrication."

Not as easy as expected as it turns out
