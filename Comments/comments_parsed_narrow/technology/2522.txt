> It's just that it will be unfiltered and Google will be sued to pieces

Sued for what? It's not illegal to express unpopular opinions, never mind unpopular opinions from a bot.

Google isn't afraid of being sued, they're terrified of any negative P.R., which is a disease endemic in the tech industry.

I wish the first line of all the AI initiatives wasn't "working to make AI safe" as in "working to make sure it doesn't offend anyone". That's not the road to innovation. Sure, it should be some concern, but it should be about #100 in the list of concerns. They should just have a line that says, "it's a creative engine that may say things that are offensive. Use with the knowledge that it's not predictable, nor may not be accurate." And move on.

But they won't, because they're terrified -- except for ChatGPT, and they should get a huge amount of credit for having to guts to release it publicly, even though it won't be perfect (and lord knows moron journalists have been trying to make a scandal when it says something they don't like).
