Did you check the sources though?

100% of all the sources chatGPT sent to me about 3d printing were fake.

And then 100% of the emails, file transfers, "private messages" chatGPT was going to send to me, also 100% haven't arrived.

The google drive links it made for me to download what it made for me, 100% fake.

100% of the scripts and coding I've gotten from chatGPT were wrong and needed heavy editing, but still very helpful, especially if you don't know the language.

edit: I think the whole thing is online if you wanted to read it, but I'm not finding the share link on my openai character thingy.
