I've been sucking dry Chatgpt for all my google search, until they paywall it I'll be using it till the last day.

the amount of useful info it can come up vs the useless shit and sponsored content I get when searching something on google it's just too much to give up.

I was searching for the trend of natural gas prices and how they would relate to domestic market utility bill increase/decreas. 30 minute of google was only articles full of pop-ups and mailing list spam, trading titles platforms or useless blogs shilling their trade bots.

I went to Chatgpt in 2 minute it was able to guide me step by step on the European commission website, what link and sub-folder to click to dowload a 180 page long report on natural resources prices and give me the exact page number to look for what I was looking for.

something that, google, which probably has indexed that document as well, could not give me.


I was pretty good with google-fu in the past years but lately they either changed their algo too much or they weight paid content too much to the point where I can't even get an AIR FRIER recipe using "brackets" terms to get what I really need. I clicked 3 recipes link and they all lacked that bracketed word (ingredient)
