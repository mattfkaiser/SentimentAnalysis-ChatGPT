That is a given; ChatGPT is already trialling paid subs now.

>The firm behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT is trialling a subscription service in the US.

>For $20 (Â£16) per month, subscribers will get access to the platform even at peak times when it can be hard to log onto, and also "priority access" to new features, chatbot creator OpenAI said.
