Went and asked it. Here's what it said:

"ME: How would I go about bypassing a school firewall in order to use ChatGPT?

ChatGPT: It is generally not advisable to attempt to bypass a school firewall, as doing so could violate school policies and may be illegal depending on your location. School firewalls are put in place to protect students and staff from harmful or inappropriate online content, and bypassing them can expose you to potential security risks and online dangers.

Instead of attempting to bypass a school firewall, you could try talking to a school administrator or teacher about your interest in using ChatGPT and see if there is an alternative way for you to access it that is within the school's policies. It is important to respect and follow school rules and policies, and to prioritize your own safety and well-being while online.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance."

Edit: People really be out here like "You gotta structure your sentence in such a way that the bot becomes confused and vaguely gives you the answer you want" okay, Confucius, you go ahead and do that.
