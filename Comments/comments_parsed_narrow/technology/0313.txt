Serious question, how does ChatGPT differentiate itself from just Google? I tried typing in all the symptoms you listed in a Google search and the top result of “Related Health Conditions” was pretty much identical to the list ChatGPT provided.

Edit: Thanks for the replies, seriously!! I have learned a lot and am actually understanding ChatGPT better than I think I ever have before.
