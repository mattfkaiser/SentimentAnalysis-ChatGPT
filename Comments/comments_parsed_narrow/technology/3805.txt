> Well you've edit the post and completely changed what you had there before?

No I didn't. I edited it to fix the formatting because Reddit was screwing with it with their pseudo Markdown.

> Even then I can't read your code in your example well. I agree with ChatGPT here that it's hard to answer without more context. What are the datatypes meant to be?

Once again, *read what it said*. ChatGPT gives two explanations based on what the datatypes could be, and is *wrong in both explanations*.

I tweaked the code snippet to be complete and runnable (I left it ambiguous before to see how ChatGPT would handle it).

    ```python
    sentence = ["I", "am", "a", "woman"]
    # If the word man is in the sentence, log a message
    for word in sentence:
        if 'man' in word:
            print("Man found")
    ```

It will confidently tell you there is no bug there. There's a super obvious bug and running it will show you it's wrong.
