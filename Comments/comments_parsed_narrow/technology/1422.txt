The formula has been as cynical as it is simple:

Push stories about how "scary and powerful" the magical new AI is, then have your CEO make equivocal statements that feed into that hysteria. To a dumb-as-bricks VC that smells like opportunity, when in fact it's a trap.

I think we're going to learn pretty quickly that this is like "self-driving cars..." the first 90% is doable, the last 10% takes decades or more. In other words people are imagining what something like ChatGPT will become soon, when it fact we've already seen most of what it will ever have to offer without a totally new approach.
