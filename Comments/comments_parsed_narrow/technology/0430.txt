I had an english teacher that made us hand write essays for entire class sessions. We wrote sooooo many essays, she corrected them, we rewrote them and i absolutely loathed it at the time. However, it made me a much stronger and more confident writer. I really didnâ€™t understand it at the time but it was really helpful for my writing development. 

The only problem i have with chatgpt is if the person doesnt already have the fundamentals of writing and comprehension down. Similar to math. I can follow math formulas by plugging numbers in but the answer means nothing to me if i cant read and understand what the answer means. 

So i agree with having some form of in person teaching that requires pen and paper. Im a big fan of learning the basics and fundamentals first. Then move on to using the tools to make us more efficient.
