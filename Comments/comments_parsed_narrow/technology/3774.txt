> Really cuz when I was a kid I was told I needed to know cursive to succeed in the future. ChatGPT is dope. People are just reacting from headlines and gut feeling.

Bingo.

Public schools are political organizations.  The decision makers are elected positions.  Your teacher answers to the principal and the principal answers to the board and the board are elected.

Taxpayers are, well, taxpayers and you piss them off enough and a lot of people who live and die in elected positions will be out of a job.

There is a trick that these people employ.  

You are correct about ChatGPT and things like it should be leveraged. 

Smart policies that properly leverage this thing are not likely to be understood by the average taxpayer and voter.

But..... 'Banning' something is a policy that can be expressed in a sound bite and takes very little effort to put in effect.

Add a couple of lines to the next handbook, make an example of some damned fool in the student body and all those people that could never understand a smart policy that leverages this technology (or any technology, ChatGPT is not special) will celebrate you as having 'done something'.

It doesn't matter what the teachers and principals think, they are along for the ride.
