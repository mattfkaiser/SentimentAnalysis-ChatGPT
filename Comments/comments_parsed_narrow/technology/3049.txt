Today I couldn't get my lecturer to simplify something enough for me to understand it - so I asked ChatGPT, then asked it to try again but this time ELI5, and I finally got it. Usually I spend half an hour Googling instead of listening to the rest of the lecture and still don't figure it out. It's a really useful tool.
