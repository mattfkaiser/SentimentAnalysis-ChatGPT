Yes, thank you. As a soon-to-be college professor for English classes, ChatGPT is something I’m unfortunately seeing way too much of recently. Students and others who argue “Well, it’s a tool like a calculator!” have a critical misunderstanding of what an essay is and what it’s supposed to do: challenge a student’s ability to progress an argument/discussion rhetorically from beginning to end. Essays are fantastic ways of teaching students not only how to think critically but also how to *express* their thinking logically, both of which are sorely missing in current civil discourse.

I don’t want to judge too much here, but I think anyone who jumps to the “It’s a tool!” line is either lazy and doesn’t want to write or hasn’t had teachers explain the necessity of essays in a good way.
