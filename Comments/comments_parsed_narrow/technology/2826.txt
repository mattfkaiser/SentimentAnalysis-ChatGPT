Also in sciences because the practical applications aren’t really about knowing equations, units, and values of constants. It’s about knowing how to apply those things, when to, and why you would. 

Like the dumbest thing ever is a HS Chem teacher making you memorize the periodic table or some dumb shit: if you work in chemistry down the line you will literally *never* be without access to one. Or the values of constants. You’ll probably use these so much if you went down postgrad in a field where it eventually becomes memorized, and understanding how the periodic table is constructed means you don’t really have to, but asking students to waste valuable *actual thinking power* on something as trite as that gives no value. 

My hardest class in college was a geophysics class for my minor. Open everything. Open book (never that helpful), notes, and homework. The last was actually the closest thing to test questions but the questions were like 2x harder. Even with all that we’d get like 50s-60s bumped up into the b range. He wasn’t even anal about the answer being exactly correct since the numbers you work with are enormous: he was happy with like, just the order of magnitude being about right. 

I see a problem with copying a straight chat GPT prompt yeah. It’s probably not even correct. Where the value comes is using it as a tool to get started past what I always found the hardest thing in writing: the first paragraph and thesis. That would take hours alone while the essay basically would write itself from there. Having to actually analyze the text chat GPT will spit at you and critically think about it it, whether it’s correct, a cohesive argument, etc. is still a valuable skill set. 

That said anecdotes of people on Reddit say they use them almost verbatim for cover letters. Since no one reads those anyway, and they suck ass to write, I’m all for that.
