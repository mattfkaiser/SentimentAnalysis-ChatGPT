I think a lot of business people just imagine chatGPT as a true AGI ( which it's not even according to its creators and proponents. ) It's damned impressive for certain but I don't think it's ready to just replace everyone's entire work force.

Honestly, if 5-10 years from now a true AGI emerges quickly, we're going to see total social collapse at some point as capitalists desperately try to justify continuing a system that no longer appears to have a purpose and almost nobody has a job. There will be transitional stages of grief, UBI will suddenly have wide bipartisan support etc.
