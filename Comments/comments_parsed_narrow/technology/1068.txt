ChatGPT saves time and increases productivity when writing business emails.

Make this polite.  "Get X project done by the 15th. Make sure you add Y&Z to documents A&B and inform Team C when done."

It then spits out all the extra people seem to require.  I preferring minimal wording TBH. Maybe because as you say people cant organise their thoughts and their emails are a mess.

But now Pandora's AI box is open, 'Basic skills' now include being able to leverage an AI to get something done and work faster now.

This isn't a good thing!

Your want for better basic skills is a way better world.
