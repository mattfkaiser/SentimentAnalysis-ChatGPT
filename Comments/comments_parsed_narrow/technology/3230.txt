Its too soon to be happening, I think, but I pretty much guarantee that within a few years, a LOT of customer service calls will essentially be handled by chat bots. There's already a lot of them that use them already, and ChatGPT is about a million times smarter than the existing ones, so look for a lot of companies to be greatly expanding their usage. 

It'll never completely eliminate the need for actual human customer service agents, but it's going to keep getting harder and harder to get to an actual human.
