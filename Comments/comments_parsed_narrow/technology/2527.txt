Their large language model (LaMDA) is probably better than GPT3. OpenAI managed to build ChatGPT in 2 weeks (13 days) on top of it. So they most likely have the tech. But

1. Does Google corporate structures will allow them to pivot that fast? It will be very, very hard to do in their "management by committee" style.
2. Google is very bad with making actual products that they stick to.
3. OpenAI is close to releasing GPT4.

They got slow, lazy and too careful. Like Intel in Microsoft in the past. They can pivot, but it will take a lot of effort. And in a few days they have some press about AI planned. I doubt they will do more than say how good their tech is that they might release later, but we will see.

I am really glad they got kicked. I'm not really sure if it will be enough to wake them up. And still having 2 companies fighting over AI dominance is for sure better than one. But what would be really good is companies just couldn't buy all those successful smaller companies to stifle innovation as they been doing for past 10+ years. (Yea, I doubt it will happen)
