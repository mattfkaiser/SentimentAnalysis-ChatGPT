I’m a mathematician who also did some a lot of engineering classes in undergrad out of interest. I went to an “elite” (gross) school and I don’t think I took a single in-person exam where a calculator was allowed outside of chemistry. The tests were written to be computationally simple (for an aspiring engineer/mathematician) but conceptually deep. Essays were different, but in college they required citations or references to specific readings which I don’t think chatgpt does. 

Out of fun me and a couple of my mathematician friends put old exam questions in chatgpt and it just kinda spits back circular logic, I’d assume it’s better for like a sociology essay, but that’s not my field so i would t know how to judge it
