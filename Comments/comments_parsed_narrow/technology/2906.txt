Obviously I am being hyperbolic when I say we tell students to fuck off, but that essentially is what homework is. "Here's something for you to do, don't bother me. But also don't cheat". The obvious (and impractical/highly expensive) solution is personal tutors for each student - personalized learning, one-on-one education to walk them through each step of reasoning and writing, and also teaching them how to leverage tools like chat GPT after they've proven to master the basics themselves. For _a_ student, it's the best possible way to elevate them to their highest potential, but we just can't do it for _everyone_ (until of course we can have Digital Aristotles... but that's for the far future of 5 years away)
