My wife recently started using chat gpt and she used to tell our 3 sons they need to go to college but lately she is saying things like I think you should be a plumber or electrician. She thinks we're entering a technological revolution where most jobs will become obsolete, especially most white collar jobs, and the best high paying jobs will be for people that can do things with their hands. 

I gotta say this article definitely reinforced her opinion for me.
