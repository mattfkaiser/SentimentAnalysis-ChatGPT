I see what you’re saying and respect your opinion, but I still disagree with you. Stealing an essay from someone online doesn’t require a prompt, or interaction. The student is still producing something, and may have to continue to tweak input to adjust the output, until an acceptable product is complete. The student is still responsible for the content, and ultimately the grade. Some students will have a great understanding of what’s being taught, and a tool like GPT will be a great time saver.

That said, I also think effective communication / writing is important. The students that don’t want to learn this will be weeded out in the interview or application process, which is great because we need unskilled laborers too. If someone manages to pass that barrier, their lack of communication skills will be shown in poor performance. If companies choose to hang on to these people, the companies bottom line may suffer. If it doesn’t, then I ask again - who cares?

The technology is here and you also have to look at the risks in trying to detect these texts. If you try to detect them through software, eventually you will falsely accuse a certain percentage of the people you test. Is that worth it? Personally, I don’t think so.

I believe society owes it to people to afford an *opportunity* to succeed in life, and part of that is of course educational opportunities. We owe it to people to give them classes on proper English. We don’t owe it to hold their hand through these classes. Some will use chat GPT as a tool and fail to learn, others will learn the material really well and set themselves apart from those that don’t. The problem will solve itself, it’s certainly better than falsely accusing people who did their own work.
