You got downvoted for preaching the truth man. Teacher’s shouldn’t be discredited, but at the same time, there was a time when students couldn’t have calculators. Then they couldn’t have phones. Now they can’t have AI. It will make its way into the classroom eventually, and likely sooner than later. I was in high school a little over a decade ago and even having a phone on you would land you in trouble. Now they use phones and iPads in class every single day, to the benefit of the students. The average kid nowadays knows way more the average kid when I was growing up due to technology. To be fair, AI like ChatGPT is in its early stages for public consumption, but I’d bet it’s a commonplace tool in classrooms in 5 years time.
