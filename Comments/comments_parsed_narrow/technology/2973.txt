This could just mean consulting chatGPT for a search query to quickly find legal information about case law pertaining to this ruling. How is this any different than using google to look something up? As long as the AI didn't actually write the ruling (or if the AI wrote a ruling the judge paraphrased lol) then this is just using a tool to gather available information.
