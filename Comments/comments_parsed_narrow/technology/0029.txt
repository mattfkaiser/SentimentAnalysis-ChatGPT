I think the people saying it will replace devs etc are looking more at what will be coming in the near future if a non specified AI model can already get this far. 

I dont think its ridiculous to assume that a language model trained specifically to handel coding queries would be far more accurate, even more so if they break it down to focus on specific languages etc.

Chat gpt in its current form isnt replacing much of anything. But its already further along than most people anticipated at this point in time and its a sign that rapid acceleration on this tech is on the horizon and that can be scary.
