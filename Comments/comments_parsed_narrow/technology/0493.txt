> “person centred therapy” and it basically relies on having a therapist that can fully empathize and accept you without an iota of judgement

I'm someone who's never been to therapy, but just wanted to mention that the whole not one iota of judgement/vulnerability aspect actually seems like a point in favor of chatgpt. at the end of the day AI is just a soulless machine that doesn't care about you. But that also means it'd never judge you, never gossip about you, never leak your vulnerabilities. the actual advice is probably crap but if the main barrier of entry to therapy is to not feel judged and feel safe, AI seems like it'd have an advantage there.
