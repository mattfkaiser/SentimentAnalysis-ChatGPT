> The whole point of teaching how to research is to show how to get information from the most reliable sources.

I think the point of teaching is to make it possible for the student to *verify* information and build their own source list from their own research.

If you don't teach them to verify information on their own, you're only teaching them that they can absolutely trust certain sources, which gives you only half of what you need as a researcher.

If you're using ChatGPT or Google or Wikipedia, you must understand the nature of each tool in the same way that you must be careful about seeking wisdoms about being sober from the drunk down at the street corner or that when you're reading a news paper, it may be politically slanted.

Political ideologies rely on you being unable to do your own research.
