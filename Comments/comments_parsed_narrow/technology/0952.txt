ChatGPT is as empathetic as a rock with googly eyes. Its natural a machine designed to cherry pick popular and desirable answers is better at giving people what they want to hear in the way they want to hear it.

But no one is entitled to other people's empathy and while we'd all love an empathic doctor or physicians, people preferring the meaningless words of a robot shows how vapid and self-centered people are. I mean everyone thinks they deserve empathy, but a good chunk of people are mean, vindictive spiteful shitheads and healthcare workers see it all. A smaller chunk are literal monsters, abusers, violent psychos and narcissists.  Every one of them think they deserve to have a 2 in 1 therapist/doctor.
