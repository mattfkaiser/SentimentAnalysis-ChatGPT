I copied the article into Chat GPT and this was what is said:

The article mentions a few opinions about the impact of AI systems like me on education and writing, specifically the undergraduate essay. It cites Noam Chomsky, who views the use of AI systems like me as "basically high-tech plagiarism" and a way of avoiding learning. Another professor, Robert Zaretsky, argues that the college essay has already died and that the output of a machine-learning system like me might actually be preferable to the "jumble of words" that students send in as finished papers.

Overall, the article accurately presents the views of Chomsky and Zaretsky on AI systems like me and their impact on education, but it doesn't provide a comprehensive assessment of the issue. While some people may view AI systems like me as a threat to traditional forms of writing and learning, others may see potential benefits in using AI systems for writing assistance or as a tool to enhance the learning process. It's important to consider a range of perspectives and conduct further research before drawing definitive conclusions.
