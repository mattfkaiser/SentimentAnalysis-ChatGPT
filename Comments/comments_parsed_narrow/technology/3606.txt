All this is going to do unfortunately is give politicians and corporations reasons to stifle free speech and push their own initiatives. They will make self publishing that much more hard and less profitable and we will lose on true free thinking and outside the box experiences. When will Amazon only sell “certified” books or the government to make books and written content that isn’t “certified” illegal to own or even be in public schools? We already see echoes of this with the rash of book bannings and burnings (I can’t believe I’m even saying these words outside of a dystopian science fiction novel or the Nazi’s of WWII) we have seen in recent years.

I love the idea of chatgpt and it’s ilk, I love the idea that it can be a tool for us to utilize to do things better and more efficiently. But if we don’t stifle this growing fear and sensationalism that is being pushed by news media and certain other special interest groups, it will only ever become a tool used by the privileged or used as a tool to control.

Fucking stop banning, sanitizing, and burning books already. For Christ sake.
