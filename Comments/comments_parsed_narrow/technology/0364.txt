I completed school and university back when almost nobody used computers, and everything you have said is 100% spot on.

The sum total of human knowledge is already so much more nowadays than it was if you go back to 1980 or even 1990. I would argue there's a tipping point where it's no longer possible to absorb all the previous knowledge in any given field in the old fashioned way, and that we will need tools like Chat GPT to help get each individual to the point where they're standing on the shoulders of giants and ready to research forward into more discoveries.
