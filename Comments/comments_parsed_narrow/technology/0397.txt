While I am not a professor nor do I read papers at the college level, I do teach high school and I can confirm that the essays I have read that are suspect chatgpt are really obvious. They do not specifically address the prompt (close, but obviously not written by someone who was there for the discussion leading up to the assignment), and they sound very mechanical - no real voice present in the writing. 

What I have found difficult is justifying a zero for cheating if the student doesn’t confess. Traditional plagiarism was easy to justify because a quick google search for a specific passage would take me straight to the original writing. With chatgpt, if the student and parent insist it was the kid’s writing I have no recourse other than giving a poor grade because it just wasn’t written well, when they really deserve a zero.
