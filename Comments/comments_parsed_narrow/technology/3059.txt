It’s just wild that society has gotten to a point where college isn’t about learning, it’s about getting the paper that says you learned. 

Ok so you cheat your way through college using ChatGPT and get into a job in your respective field. Day one when you need some actual knowledge what are you gonna do? Google everything? This won’t work at scale. 

Everything is so abstracted and is going to have hard hitting ramifications. Engineers and doctors faking their way thru college using AI aren’t going to be doing the best work.
