"77% of companies using ChatGPT say they use it to help write job descriptions"

Nobody writes a job description from scratch. They use an old one or Google one. 

I used chatgpt to create a job description for a specialized role. It creates a good one, but very similar to the first that came up on Google. 

In fact, suspiciously similar.
