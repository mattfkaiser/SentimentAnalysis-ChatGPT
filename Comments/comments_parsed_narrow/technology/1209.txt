I think it's pretty obvious. Everyone other industry uses government to stifle competition through government, through regulations, using fear to to do it. I don't buy it. They're algorithms, they're not sentient AI, and even if they were sentient AI the government has no business getting involved with anything outside of the damn constitution. It's a conversation that should be had outside of government. This regulation call from Chat GPT is clearly them trying to rid themselves of all the other companies and individuals hopping onboard it. Anyone in their basement can make AI now, and they know it. It's foolish to try and control a technology we're still learning and has this much potential to do good. Every buffoon and their mother is scared of new things when they come out but ultimately we figure it out in the end. The same scare happens with every new technology. The free market will decide if it's safe or not. Same thing happened with cars lol. Now we have all these safety features, and guess what people still die. The world isn't safe, never was, never will be, you either learn to adapt or you die. You either wipe your own ass or someone else does it for you. So you can cry about it all you want, but at the end of the day, if I'm paying for it, I want it. You don't get to decide what is safe for me, I do. Period. Grow up, and start taking responsibility for your own life and leave the rest of us out of it.
