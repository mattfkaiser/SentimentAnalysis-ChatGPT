No. It can simulate decision making that seems human like. Thats it 

Can we PLEASE collectively stop falling for yhe “ChatGPT is good at X decision making and is AI” shit? Its an advanced chat bot. It is NOT making decisions. It is gathering (usually wrong) trivia from the web and then presenting it as fact. 

The fact that most redditors fall for this shit shows they’re no better than the anti-vaxxers on facebook. FFS.
