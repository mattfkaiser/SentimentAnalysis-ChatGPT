Absolutely, as a high school teacher we work and rework essays through writing conferences. There are multiple revisions and if a student uses ChatGPT or caktus, that will become painfully obvious in a writing conference. 
Maybe it’s not absolutely terrible seeing as they get to read an exemplar. 

I had ChatGPT write a few essays for different prompts. It writes well-organized, but simplistic essays. The transitions and structure follow the five-paragraph hamburger essay and I find it had redundancies. I’ll try and revise GPT prompts to see if it can generate essays following different organizational structures for the same topic. 

I want to also see it’s ability to respond to the same prompt with a variety of thesis statements. 

It isn’t able to do the deep literary analysis and focuses more on broad generalizations and main ideas. I haven’t seen any evidence of it accurately citing evidence to support literary analysis. 

Never has there been a better time to beat the bots by expressing unique stories, ideas, and interpretations supported by logic and reasoning.
