Well I was worried about finding a job coding until today when I spent an hour arguing with ChatGPT about code because it couldn't wrap its circuits around how a circular buffer works and had incorrect comments about when it would be full and how it should behave when the writer index catches up to the reader index. It seems pretty good at basic data structures and saves some time copying down skeletons from pseudocode or python, though.
