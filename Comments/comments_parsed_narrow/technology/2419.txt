It shocks me how many people are in denial that chatgpt and other advanced AI will replace a large chunk of their jobs within the next 10 years.

The AI doesn't have to "perfect" for most of these jobs, just "good enough" where someone will say, "fuck it" I'd rather save money, pay for an AI plugin or piece of work than pay a person.

Writers, Possibly underwriters, etc. and especially artists have their heads in the sand.

You go to the art subs and many can't admit, their jobs are on the line.

AI doesn't sleep, complain, call in sick, require paid benefits....the list goes on.

AI is coming for jobs whether you believe it or not.
