I don't understand the panic behind chatgpt cheating scandals. For shorter assignments, just go back to pen and paper. Not everything needs to be done on a computer. Or heaven forbid, actually proctor your exams if technology is a must. Hold exams in class and watch students complete their work. Secondary school teachers and even many college profs assign almost everything as upsuprivised online homework and then wonder why cheating is so rampant.

This is nothing more than another item into the pile of Ls that school districts take for being so dependent on technology.
