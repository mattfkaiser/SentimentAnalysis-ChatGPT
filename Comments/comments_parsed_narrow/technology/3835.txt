I had some crappy teachers especially during my earlier school years. That said, I would have found it awesome, if we had things like Youtube back then to listen to different people explaining different concepts, that specific teachers just aren’t able or don’t care enough to break down in digestible portions. It’s similar to what I see in ChatGPT or more generally AI for their future potential. People are way too hung up on it still being imperfect and the perceived copyright issues to see where it may actually benefit society as a whole. From a personal perspective this discussion is similar to the one we had, whether or not copyright trumps the needs of the blind when books got transcribed to braille.
