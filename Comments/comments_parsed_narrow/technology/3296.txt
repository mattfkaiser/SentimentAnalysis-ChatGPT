ChatGPT is still really stupid. I don’t know how many times last week it said “I’m sorry, you’re right about” when I corrected it. But even if it was perfect, you still have to write good questions about the subject you have decent knowledge in. So, as a tool, it’s great…a way better search engine than Google now. Kinda like in Interstellar with Tara and Case…they were great pilots, but you still needed a pilot.
