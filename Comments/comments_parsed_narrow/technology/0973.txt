For me, the most annoying thing about ChatGPT is how freewheeling people are with accusations that others are using it. I recently posted a lengthy comment that I’d put a decent amount of effort into writing, and initially it was getting upvotes, but then a user came along and accused it of being written by ChatGPT. That was all it took to turn the tide and the comment ended up downvoted, so I deleted it.

The result is I’m finding myself less and less inclined to participate, because anything I write could be accused of being written by a bot (which it wasn’t) and summarily dismissed.
