Yup. I think the comparison to calculators is in fact wrong. Calculators don't solve the problem for you (unless you're using one of those graphing ones), they just do rote arithmetic. Using ChatGPT is far more similar to having someone else write your paper, which, as you may guess, is VERY not okay in academia.
