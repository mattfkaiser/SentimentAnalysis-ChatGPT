So I read the complaint, and boy oh boy. There's no actual screenshots of what they prompted, simply the output that they conclude is defamatory, but if you keep reading they give the game away:

>31. Riehl contacted Gottlieb regarding ChatGPTâ€™s allegations concerning Walters, and   
Gottlieb confirmed that they were false.

So no actual defamation occurred. Even if we assume that they didn't work it over with a blow-torch and a pair of pliers to get the response, a statement has to be made publicly to be defamatory. I'll bet a dozen donuts on this never making it to trial
