>While this is a good distinction to make and I agree that it might be a problem that the developers are putting their own opinions in the chat bots voice, I don't think that any of those solutions would alleviate concerns about "wokeness".

Also it's just software, it doesn't have thought or a voice. The people making those statements are ignorant at best or possibly idiotic. Trying to make a rational point of view assessment is a waste of time. They are concluding things based on nothing. The AI's voice? Give me a break lmao. Take their stagement and replace any reference of the words ChatGPT with Microsoft Clippy. It's the exact same ignorant statement.
