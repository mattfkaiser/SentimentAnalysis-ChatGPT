What's with this pervasive myth that a junior developer somehow doesn't solve novel problems or debug novel issues? I've got news for you practically every problem even in the academic world requires problem solving skills. 

Also there is a pervasive belief that chatGPT can't solve anything new which is literally proven wrong over and over again too, but I guess some people just love keeping their head in the sand.
