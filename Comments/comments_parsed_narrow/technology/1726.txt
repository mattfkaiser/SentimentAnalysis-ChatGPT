This is my friend. He's very excited about AI, but he's romanticizing chatGPT to the point of arguing that we aren't being considerate of its feelings.

When you try to explain to him that it's not "intelligence," there's no sentience, it's just a bunch of algorithms, he says "isn't that basically what our thought is?"

And it's like... Yes, sort of, I guess? But there's a big difference between an algorithm responding to a prompt, and a human hearing and interpreting a question, coming up with an answer, being aware of the answer and the thought process, and then responding.
