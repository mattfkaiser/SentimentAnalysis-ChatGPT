Not to mention most therapists are really mediocre if not terrible. It took me 10 years and 6-7 arduous attempts before I found someone who was dedicated and professional. And that’s in affluent parts of New York City. I can’t imagine what it’s like elsewhere in the states. And as you said, the process of finding someone in the US is itself an awful undertaking. In my experience, Chat GPT is more qualified and infinitely more accessible than most real therapists, even if it’s occasionally not nuanced enough on details of an interaction.
