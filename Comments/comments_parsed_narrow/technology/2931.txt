I’m a teacher and I’m all for chatGPT. The goal of education should be to make life easier for you. Employers don’t care what steps you took, as long as the job is done. Education in its present form is pretty redundant and impractical nowadays anyway. We need a massive reform to make schools more relevant. Kids should be learning about forming labor unions and writing code, not Shakespeare. Like it’s fine as an elective but shouldn’t be a focus.
