Hi ChatGPT, please write me a python script that can emulate keyboard presses  
Let it read a text file and "type"  the characters in a realistic   
time.  Take occasional long pauses between words or sentences.    And save (ctrl-s)   
from time to time.

(Reddit doesn't let me copy/paste, but it does generate a nice little script that looks like it would work, it even randomises the pauses between characters and words.)
