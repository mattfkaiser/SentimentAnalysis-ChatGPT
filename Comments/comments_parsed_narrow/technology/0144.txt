TBF, these are very different technologies and at very different states.

AI is overblown at its current state. At the same time, it is not using pure logic for calculations, it only serves the best answer it can from databases of information all over the internet...which as you know, can have wrong information.

I work in the field. Chat GPT is a great step, but the way the media and marketing portrays it is just absolutely wrong.
