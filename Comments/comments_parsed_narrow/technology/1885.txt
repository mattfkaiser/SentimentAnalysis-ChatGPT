I’ve done this. I needed a script for a Google doc that would update a time stamp to the header whenever the document is edited. Like Updated on: date & time by: user. Google docs doesn’t have the onEdit trigger like sheets does so I was totally lost on how to code it so I asked ChatGPT. It gave me something that I thought would work. Got an error message. Tried again and another error. I did that for an hour until I realized there was no simple way of coding this functionality and even though ChatGPT knows this it doesn’t say it, it just makes up functions that don’t exist to solve the problem. I know enough to know why it wasn’t working, but if I knew less then I’d be really confused about why I kept getting error messages. 

I never did sort it out, I think the best option is to use the revision history of the doc but I’m really not sure how to do that since I think it needs to be accessed through the Google drive data and not the individual doc
