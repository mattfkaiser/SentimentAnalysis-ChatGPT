The one thing not being discussed is that ChatGPT is basically in a free trial stage right now. It won't be free for much longer because the costs of running it are massive (per the CEO). So this isn't like Wikipedia, which is free forever.

I'm guessing it will be segmented into specialized uses and will be priced accordingly.
