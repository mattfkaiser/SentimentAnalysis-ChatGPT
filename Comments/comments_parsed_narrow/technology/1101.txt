ChatGPT refused to analyze crime drama book for me because "art is supposed to be about happy things and I shouldn't write to it about negative subjects".

It's so censored it's pretty much useless. I'm not interested in using, and especially paying for an AI that can just decide to give me fake moral lessons or judge my tastes on art instead of factual answers or entertainment. This whole neural net technology is being kidnapped and walled off from regular people by corporations at this point.
