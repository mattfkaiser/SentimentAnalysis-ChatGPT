Yea. And success of ChatGPT even surprised OpenAI. They made it out of 2-years old tech in 13 days. I've been using GPT3 before that for a while and I was also surprised how popular it got for how little new things it provided (essentially the UX... and censorship). 

I think OpenAI got extremely lucky with timing. The AI hype was growing in media and general population for a while now. Ofc. it being free + simple to use UX helped a lot too.
