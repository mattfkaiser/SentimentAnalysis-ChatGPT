if you've ever used ChatGPT it's pretty explicit in you not sharing personal information with it.  

but that doesn't stop people from doing it and it doesn't stop chatGPT from collecting it if you give that information to it.  


It's not really saying ChatGPT is malicious, just that it's can potentially violate laws they have in place around data collection and analytics.  Especially involving minors.  


This is the sort of stuff the USA is failing to protect us on because we no longer have a functioning legislative branch.
