"As a language model, ChatGPT does not have the ability to take exams or have morals or basic human decency. It can provide information and generate text based on the input it receives, but it does not have consciousness or emotions. Additionally, an MBA program covers a wide range of topics, including ethics and leadership, which are important aspects of business decision making. A machine like ChatGPT can assist in providing information and data analysis but cannot replace the human element in decision making that takes into account ethical considerations."
