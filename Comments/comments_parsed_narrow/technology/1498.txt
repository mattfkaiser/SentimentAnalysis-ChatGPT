I also write a lot, mostly technical design documents, so it's usually information dense and nobody cares about the style. However, it also bothered me that I had trouble with using connecting words to give my arguments better flow. This is one aspect that ChatGPT has helped me immensely. It can take my poorly written sentences, which is more like bullet points, and show me how it can flow more like a narrative. This is incredibly powerful because my strength is clarity of thinking, and ChatGPT can help me with expressing it.
