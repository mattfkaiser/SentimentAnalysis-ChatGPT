It should be more concerning than that.

It's not the calculator. It's flipping to the back of the book to read the answer key. It's paying someone else to write your essays for you, minus the paying.

The point of most exercises in education isn't to teach students to prepare the product they're producing (essay, etc). It's to teach them how to research a topic and synthesize ideas, or it's to teach them about the substance of the topic they're researching by requiring them to engage with it deeply enough to produce something new. Learning how to write a good prompt for ChatGPT doesn't build any of those skills, but ChatGPT is not and never will be a replacement for those skills in the real world.

The kinds of assignments and tests from which I always learned the most in school were the ones that allowed me to take plenty of time, and use every resource at my disposal, to answer challenging questions I can't just look up anywhere. ChatGPT is greatly shrinking the list of things teachers can ask students to do that they can't just look up, that require some actual work and learning. 

It's going to be much harder for teachers to use those kinds of tools now, because students will be able to cheat them with ChatGPT or its more sophisticated descendants. This could end up favoring in-class tests of rote memorization and other bullshit that sends education backward rather than forward.
