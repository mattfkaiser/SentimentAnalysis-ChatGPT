Write a reddit style comment to explain to people that I am using an LLM to make my writing sound more casual and human. Please dumb it down, and use some common mistakes in grammar and typos.

Hey y'all, so uhmm I've been usin this fancy shmancy LLM thingy called ChatGPT, u kno like, one of those AI thingamabobs. 🤖 It helps me make my writin' sound more like, well, a person n' all. Lol, I kno it's kinda weird, but it's like I got this robot buddy helpin me chillax my grammar and stuff, so I don't come off too much like a smartypants. 😅 So yeah, if you see some typos n' grammer mistakes, it's probs coz of that! Just tryin' to be more human-y, y'know? 🤷‍♂️🤣





That is too verbose. Nobody human will type so much. Make a shorter version.

Yo, I'm usin' this AI called ChatGPT to make my writin' more casual & human-like 😅 So if u see typos or weird grammar, that's why lol 🤖👍




Make it more like a comment by a speaker who uses English as a second language.
