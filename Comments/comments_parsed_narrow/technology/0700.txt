I work for a small business on a team of three people. We've already started laughing about how we will absolutely be replaced by AI. Like.. maybe not our boss specifically but I could see him just not replacing us as we leave for automated AI. At the very least he could go down to one office staff that could cover the parts and AI can't cover.

We started using ChatGPT for email replies to difficult clients. It's real handy when you're trying to figure out how to not ask someone if they're an idiot. It does a very good job.

Edit, I work as a service provider. Effectively a sales person but.. you either need our service or you don't. Figured I'd include that since it often feels like most people on this sub are IT type people
