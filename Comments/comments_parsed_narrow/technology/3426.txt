Until Chat GPT can provide factual information 100% of the time, or do work with 100% accuracy, it is not replacing jobs. As a tax accountant, I asked Chat GPT some very simple tax questions, and it failed to answer them 100% correctly. These jobs require accuracy, and are not going to be done by something that makes silly and unpredictable math errors, even if it gets it right most of the time. Employers know that, and they aren’t going to take this seriously while it is still making such egregious errors, even if the errors aren’t frequent. Another problem is the unpredictability of the errors makes it impossible to rely on it, and supervising it when it makes unpredictable errors is almost as time consuming as doing all the work yourself. I think it is just going to remain more of an assistant to human work until it can get it right, and I don’t think it will get it right for a very long time, if ever.
