It’s text, there is no meta data or image artifacts like text to image AI creations. Copy and paste of ASCII characters. There is no fool proof way of detecting it was written by AI, only signs. And as the AI improves, it will be more and more human like. You could even tell it to write it as if it was a child, a certain author, or a C student. Or feed it stuff you have written to understand your style of writing. This will lead to many false positives and accusing students who are not cheating, of cheating. This is already happening with current detection methods.

If you haven’t tried ChatGPT, I suggest doing so. I’ve had it write poems and song lyrics, or get into discussions with it. It’ll even argue its point unless you prove it wrong, and then it’ll frickin’ apologize to you. I didn’t think it was as good as everyone was saying until I tried it.
