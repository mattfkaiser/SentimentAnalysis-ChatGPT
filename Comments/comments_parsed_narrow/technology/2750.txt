Ok.... And? Wasn't it a decade ago that Watson won on Jeopardy? Couldn't a common calculator arguably pass some entry level math exam? How many developers rely on Stack Overflow results?

Also, supposedly it scored at the bottom... Probably worth taking into consideration pretty heavily.

This hype over some AI that's particularly good at language really needs to be understood for what it is - it's not better at much of anything except language. Humans are still infinitely better at things, and even Google is better at certain times. ChatGPT is just better at language.

For comparison, there's a huge ordeal about ChatGPT replacing developers, yet I consistently give simple and single-line solutions to things for which it gives 30+ line solutions that might not even accomplish the desired task.
