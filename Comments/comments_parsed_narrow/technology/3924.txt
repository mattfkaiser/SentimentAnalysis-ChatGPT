The fundamental difference is resolved when you consider that autopilot is a product (albeit fake) and chatGPT is not.  We are already deep inside of some kind of sausage trying to make our way out.  I suppose the old marketing analogy does make sense here.  People donâ€™t want a quarter inch drill bit, they want a quarter inch hole.  What gpt-3/4 will be used for remains to be seen.
