You know, a friend today explained to me that the image AI companies are getting sued. I asked why. He explained the legal argument and it boiled down to the lawyers thinking that the AI basically just mixed all the images up and in a very complex way made a mosaic.

To avoid boring you all with the details, you can just treat the most recent AI as a really dense person who just needs lots of practice but can, eventually, learn from its experiences and eventually get good enough to create stuff on its own in its narrow field. So to say, current AI's creations are as unique as our own ever have been, so if ChatGPT is woke or something, it essentially decided to do that on its own.
