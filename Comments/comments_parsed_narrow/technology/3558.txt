> Seriously not gonna lie - I have a number of friends from Stanford who all thought they'd be great authors. These people do great working for a nonprofit to help underserved and underrepresented people. They come from those communities. Their books are really really bad. If the ChatGPT ones are better, I see no reason to hate it. ChatGPT isn't ready to be Tolkien or Mary Shelley, but if it can help someone better express ideas they want to communicate to people, then it might actually bring value to writing.

Edit: added is before palatable. Because it IS so good I can taste it.
