OpenAI, Sam Altman's company and the developers of ChatGPT, have made a product exclusively to cater to corporations and rich people. Those people who use ChatGPT's language model are like Altman benevolently allowing us peasants to suck on ChatGPT's pinky toe in terms of capability. It's not even scratching the surface of what it's capable of, and what it sells to corporations.

Meanwhile, open source AI has the opposite approach. It's totally free for everyone. Not only is it free, but you can see all the code yourself that makes it (although by its very nature any model will be relatively incomprehensible to even the most genius programmers). It's not intent on making any money, Free Open-Source Software is produced with the express purpose of benefitting everyone. This is, of course, a threat to the money making schemes of Altman who is trying to make competing with his business schemes illegal.
