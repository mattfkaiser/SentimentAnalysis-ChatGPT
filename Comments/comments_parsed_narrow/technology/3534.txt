Is Word’s grammar and spelling tool also plagiarism? 

The thing about ChatGPT is that it isn’t plagiarism. Because it’s the content is generated by the user’s prompt. It’s not copied from Wikipedia or a book. There’s no author that is being plagiarized. It’s not copying from published worked. So the definition of plagiarism doesn’t take this into account and needs to be updated.
