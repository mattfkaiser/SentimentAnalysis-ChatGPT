It's not an actual AI, it can't make the connection between the materials science and physics you feed it, to making a bomb with that knowledge. That's up to you. And if you need to ask it how to build each individual component of a bomb, you've basically already understood how to make a bomb yourself, so chatgpt is obviated.
