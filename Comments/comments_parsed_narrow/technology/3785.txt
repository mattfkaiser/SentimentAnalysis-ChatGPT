As far as I understand it, it's a bit of a grey area, but no one really owns chatgpts output and you can use it however you want - but there's a chance it could contain copywritten material so it's best to check yourself.

That said if the content itself wouldn't be flagged by a plagiarism detector then banning students using it is entirely meaningless because you can't enforce it.
