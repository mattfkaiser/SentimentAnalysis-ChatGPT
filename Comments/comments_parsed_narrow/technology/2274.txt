If anything this is proof that the way we're educating kids is outdated and reform to the education system is long overdue.

ChatGPT is only going to get better and more integrated into our lives, so it makes no sense to limit people from using it. Like what are we teaching? Hey kids this is a useful tool that can help us be more intelligent and efficient, let's NOT use it. That's just counter intuitive. Plus with ChatGPT getting better it's going to find a way to work around any type of filter/system teachers try to implement.

So why not just reform the education system to work with tools like ChatGPT and what not. The whole push back against it just shows the backwards minded mentally of education as a whole.
