The kids using chatgpt are the ones who care about learning.  The kids doing what their teacher say, fully knowing their teacher is spewing obsolete crap, just want a piece of paper and to get a good grade on the English portion of the SAT and so on.

Nobody is punished more by the school system than learners though lolâ€¦
