People who use ChatGPT as an answer source are going to have problems and are just lazy.  I've used it to generate ideas on topics related to professional work, but purely as a brainstorming tool to get some words or basic ideas around a topic and to get the juices flowing.  I've done the same with Diffusion, just a quick iterative tool, even training it with a few dozen examples of my own work just to quickly generate starting points.
