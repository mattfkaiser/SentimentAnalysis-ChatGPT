Not saying this to debate you, but thought it would be interesting to bring up. I am a transfer student who did 2 years of CC before transferring to UCLA, and it blew my mind how far behind some students were in the GE classes I took in CC. I doubt professors and teachers are worried about smart students who use ChatGPT as a framework and then completely rewrite it, this is essentially what writing an essay is in the first place  (to an extent). The reality is, there are students who are in college that write at a first grade level, even worse in some cases, that will start copying and pasting stuff from ChatGPT without revising it. They probably won't even bother changing the font if it is different from the submission box, that is the level students are at out of the US education system. Instead of students facing consequences for obviously cheating, teachers are forced to push them through, community colleges do the same thing to keep their graduation rates up. What will our future look like when a majority of people are completely uneducated?

This isn't really a problem with AI in specific, just seems like the US education system is already failing and incapable of properly addressing the rapid advancement of technology.
