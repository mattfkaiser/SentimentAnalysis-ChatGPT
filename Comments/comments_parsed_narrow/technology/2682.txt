> Everyone said Wikipedia was an unreliable source (particularly in higher ed)

This keeps being said, and it's not true. 

The issue, like with chatgpt, is that students will try to plagiarize and turn in work that isn't theirs. 

And you should not cite "wikipedia" for research papers. That's as true today as it was 20 years ago. Get the source.
