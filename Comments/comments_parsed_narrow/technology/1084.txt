Every time I ask ChatGPT to answer my essay questions it gives me a wildly wrong answer. When it works I use it as a sort of guide to write my own, which helps with writers block a fair bit, but like this last time it was so far off base I donâ€™t have a clue where it got the information. 

I asked it a specific question on a specific paper. I even gave it page numbers. The paper it wrote me as a response was on a totally different topic than the one I literally told it to do. 

Funny enough, I could tell who used ChatGPT instead of reading the paper because a handful of people answered discussion posts with the response it gave.
