I disagree. It’s better than that. I taught legal writing at a top law school and my chatgpt answers would fit cleanly into a stack of those papers, ie not the best, but not the worst. 

Honestly it’s odd to me that people keep feeling the need to be dramatic about chatgpt in either direction. It’s very impressive but limited.

Publicly available generative ai for casual searching is an important milestone. It’s better than naysayers are saying and not as sky is falling as chicken littles are saying… 

But overall, it is absolutely impressive.
