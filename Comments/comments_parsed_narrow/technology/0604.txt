I only use chatgpt for making haikus. It works most of the time.

Threads intertwining,
Opinions clash and unite,
Reddit's web of thought.

Community thrives,
Upvotes and downvotes clash,
Karma's fleeting grace.

Subreddits buzzing,
Threads of wit and knowledge flow,
Upvotes fuel the soul.

In Reddit's vast realm,
Communities come alive,
Haiku whispers thrive.
