Still AI is incredibly useful for virtually all white collar work because it helps with writing.  Microsoft also seems to agree, as GPT4 is being integrated into Word and Outlook.  When you need to figure out how do do something when you're stuck on virtually anything, ChatGPT can help you by working as a pseudo-search engine, but one that won't link you to walls to SEO blogspam, but instead one that occasionally hallucinates.

ChatGPT hit 100 monthly active users in two months making it the fastest growing application in history back in January.  It's not mainstream in most workplaces because its usage would have to grow faster than the fastest growing application in history (itself) for that to be the case after 4 months, and I legitimately don't know if even Microsoft's servers could handle that much load that quickly.  I don't think the fact it isn't mainstream yet doesn't mean the mainstream method people are using to do their day to day work is actually efficient, and it will become mainstream by the time many students graduate.  I see it as helping students to teach them the basics of how to use it, how to deal with it telling you false information, letting them use it on select tests and assignments, and so on.
