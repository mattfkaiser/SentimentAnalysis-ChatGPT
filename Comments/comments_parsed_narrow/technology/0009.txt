AI writing isn't great, but lots of student writing isn't great either. Lots of legitimate essays are repetitive, go on tangents, and say effectively nothing in too many words. They don't deserve an A, but they also don't deserve an F if they're written by a human.

Assuming every professor can distinguish AI prose from human prose with high accuracy is an extremely high bar, especially for professors with limited tech literacy or no prior experience with ChatGPT and similar. And if they falsely accuse someone, it can permanently mess up the person's GPA or ability to graduate depending on how harsh the school's plagiarism policy is.
