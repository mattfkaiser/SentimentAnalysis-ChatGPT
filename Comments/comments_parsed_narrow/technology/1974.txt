So many fellow programmers have their panties in a bunch over this thing, like it's gonna take their job.  It's basically a faster way to do "some fairly common question site:stackoverflow.com" on google, and the complex/niche questions stackoverflow doesn't have an answer for chatgpt definitely doesn't have the answer for either.

...if that can take your job it deserves to be taken.
