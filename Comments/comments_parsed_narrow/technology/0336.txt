Reminds me of when IBM rolled out Watson.  I went to a presentation by some of the execs/high level people on the project, and they were bragging about how it could diagnose things better than doctors could.

Then it never took off, and a big study came out years later that claimed Watson would just make shit up if it didn't have enough data to come to a good conclusion.

I'm still in the "wait and see" camp when it comes to any of these ChatGPT claims.
