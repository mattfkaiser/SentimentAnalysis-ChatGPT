Also consider how a human learns.

Sure, book text is copyrighted, but when we learn about literature at school it directly influences how we write going forward. Sure, we don’t copy paste into our essays or books we write as an adult but there is the influence. It’s similar with AI. Fine, if ChatGPT pastes a whole chapter from a book into its output that’s copyrighted, but most copyright has fair use, and if the output is only slightly influenced from millions of input sources, is that any different to a human reading 100 books and writing their own novel that takes inspiration from them all?
