Funny thing is when I want to search something, I use Google or DuckDuckGo. Google is riddled with ads and nonsense but it’s the kind of ads and nonsense I’ve learned to skip past without burning mental cycles on it. When I want a ChatGPT answer, I go to ChatGPT instead of Bing, because it’s not that I’m wildly searching for something I can’t find but because I’m looking for a solution to a task — and I’m not sure I will ever default to Bing for that, especially with their pressure to get the best experience with Edge as my browser. Sprinkle all the AI in that they want, I will never accept Edge as my default browser.
