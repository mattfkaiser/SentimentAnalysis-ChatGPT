No. Machine learning is not remotely close to human. We have emotion and deep connections and have what is called "creativity". That is not comparable to a massive data set fed in from other people's works where massive portions of that set are being copied into its responses.

A human can absorb information and we can branch out and create new things. Come up with new ideas. Machine learning cannot do this. It also lacks context, and reiterating before, lacks creativity and branching out. It's not stroking each pixel or each letter of each word itself.

I can almost guarantee if you take these "ChatGPT-written books" and check each sentence or paragraph against a massive database of real human-written books, it would be clouded with blatant plagiarism.
