I received an email today that read, “I haven’t been able to get the small computer to work. I tried Thursday-Friday and again today. It keeps telling me the server is not connected. I’ve tried all the tricks to get it to kick on but its still not connecting.”

My coworkers couldn’t pass a Turing test. I’d rather have ChatGPT sending me emails most of the time.
