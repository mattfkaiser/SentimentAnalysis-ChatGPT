Absolutely, chatGPT and other systems like it will be incredible tools for people who understand what they're doing.  
My analogy has always been around it being just like programmers/IT people and their google-fu. Google and stack overflow have a lot of info but you need to be able to pose the right questions to actually get valuable details out.
