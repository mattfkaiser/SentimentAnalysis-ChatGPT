No surprise there... We have billions of humans, and bullshitters are still successful for years or even decades before being found out. Because competition works in first approximation on *sounding* reasonable/knowledgeable.  Only once we work with actual specialists, the bullshitters are found out.

Now we have one prominent trained AI model, also trained on *sounding* convincing. It will take a swarm of those, applying the "knowledge," many of them failing before we end up with a few reliable models. 

What does surprise me, thinking a few decades back, is that finally Computers get good emulating creativity for entertainment. Ask ChatGPT to make up e.g. a DnD adventure. Give some keywords, add some parameters here and there, and it can do quite a lot of the busy-work.
