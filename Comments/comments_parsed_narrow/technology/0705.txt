Highly unlikely. Chatgpt is not revolutionary in the same capacity as the internet or computers yet. Perhaps eventually but no where close now.

It can not replace trades at all atm. It can not do research into fields where there is no knowledge. It can not solve the issue of nursing. It can't replace physical human interactions.

There are million of job right now that could be automated 20 Years ago but isn't because people want the human interactions that comes with it.

Yes a robot could 100% dispense medicine far better and more accurately then any human but people like the person there. They want to be able to express there fears and doubts to nurses and have them comfort them during difficult times. Cold emotionless robots with nothing but logic is not enough for alot of people. They want to feel like the other person truely cares and chatgpt does not provide.

If anything people need to begin considering going into fields where there is both a need for hard skills and soft skills. Nursing will always be in demand. Therapist as well. Scientists to push the boundaries of science. Engineers to build things.
