Funny, that's kinda how ChatGPT works as well - it claims shit with unabashed, absolute certainty, but if you know the subject it's talking about and try to have it give answers to more complex/indepth problems that require a bit more than what anyone could've found by reading the first results of a google search for 10-15 mins, you notice that it's just a con.

(Don't get me wrong - it's seriously impressive and it's a awesome tool for a lot of things, you just have to be aware that it will occasionally lie to you)
