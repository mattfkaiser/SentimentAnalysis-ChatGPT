>	You do realize that ChatGPT is a public relations campaign?  It sounds like you’re saying that it’s cool for them to shape public opinion but it’s not cool for me to criticize how it’s being shaped.

I’m just going to focus on this one as it’s the most relevant to our discussion. I’m saying you are applying this idea that the public knows and cares about “how the sausage is made” as opposed to only caring about the end product. The general public couldn’t care less how the product works, just that it works. 

It’s like complaining that car commercials just show the car driving around as opposed to detailing how they manufacture engines and various components. No one is buying a car because of how it was manufactured so they don’t advertise how it was manufactured. This is the same thing.
