No one’s being harmed by deepfake porn, or art theft through art generators churning out thinly veiled iterations of their training data without compensating the artists it was trained on, or mass intellectual dishonesty when ChatGPT is used to write essays, or dishonesty to the public when CNET uses deep language models to write articles instead of paying journalists, or the loss of accountability when ChatGPT is listed as a co-author on academic papers and makes up citations to articles that don’t exist?

Maybe government oversight isn’t a viable solution, maybe these problems require a larger societal shift to address, but to ignore that there are problems at all is foolish.
