ChatGPT is essentially just a much more advanced Google search autocomplete. But because of the way it works it handles natural language very well. The downside is it can just make stuff up completely. I asked about a programming task, and it just made up function calls that don't exist in the library I asked about. But they exist in enough other libraries it guesses they probably do exist.

It also makes up plausible sounding paper titles for references, and other such inventions. It all looks plausible, but it's wrong.
