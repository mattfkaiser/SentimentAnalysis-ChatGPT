ML algorithms like chatgpt are only as good as their training data.  These algorithms might seem good right now, as they are trained on real human writing, but if they become ubiquitous, then their quality will likely go down with the quality of training data.  Chatgpt and others are interesting technology demos, but that's about it right now.  The algorithms will need to be improved to become more useful, or even integrated with other tools.  For example, chatgpt can't do simple things like calculations or check if the code it writes compiles.
