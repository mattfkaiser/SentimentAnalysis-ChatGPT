I'm really getting sick of these bullshit headlines.

Yes, when an intelligent professional collects, correlates and sets out relevant data and feeds it to a calculator and asks the right questions, it pops out with a mathematically correct answer that can then be interpreted by said professional. These headlines make it seem like you can just say "Hey chatgpt, invest my $100 and make me a millionaire!"

This is just feeding working class insecurity and making wealthy idiots assume AI is far more head than it is. I predict we're gonna see a few years of catastrophic overestimation of AI capabilities and it will be the fault of these shithouse clickbait websites.
