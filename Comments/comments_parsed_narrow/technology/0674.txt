Hey chatGPT, interview the product owner to get some sensible requirements. The product owner joined the company just 3 weeks ago and does not know his arse from his elbow. Summarise the contents and put into a badly formatted PowerPoint, then paste a picture of that text into the Jira tickets and go play poker with Bing and Bard to derive the story points. Iâ€™ll do the coding myself thanks.
