I’m a copy/content writer and definitely a lot of marketing agencies are experimenting if not down right replacing writing roles with Chat gpt. But is it saying anything new if it’s juts scraping and parroting what’s already been written?  It's going to be interesting when no new information from humans is created and AI is just plagiarizing itself in a loop for the rest of time.
