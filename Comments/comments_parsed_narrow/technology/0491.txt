Whatever the reason is, is of no importance. I've been going to therapists for 7y and illegal use of ketamine for 3 times helped me more than 7y. The return on investment just isn't there and I will never take a therapist seriously or refer others to as it's such a colossal waste of money and time. I'm an anecdotal example of course, but with me there are so many who have been and wish they could get a refund.
