> Bro if you think candidates aren't already using heavily tailored speeches to be as safe as possible I don't know what to tell you.  
  
But we're just entering into the realm where machine learning and natural speech modeling could generate text based off exabytes of statistics and historical data. Right now we have professionals using their experience to write speeches for the people they work for. Now we're at a point where an AI could combine the best parts of every documented speech written in every language in the past 100 years and produce a message to the masses that could be hard to resist.  
  
Imagine a future presidential candidate that gives a speech that somehow simultaneously glosses over the needs of every political party and socioeconomic position fluidly while also coyly not saying anything at all... with Donald Trump style authority and presence.
