>For one, ChatGPT doesn't have free will and it will produce a consistent output for the same prompt in the same version

Except it's not, anyone have tried to use ChatGPT even once should know that the same prompt will give different answer each time.

I tried to use it to edit my translation of a novel to make sentences flow better, and with the same prompt, the same input text, it give different edit each time.
