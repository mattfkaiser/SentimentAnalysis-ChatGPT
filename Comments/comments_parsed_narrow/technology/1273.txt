The second and third paragraphs are presented as different but closer consideration suggests they're repetitions ("cease being a good measure of their understanding" = "they might [X] rather than genuinely comprehending the material"). I am experimenting with ChatGPT. I suspect it's argumentation can be improved by pointing out the deficiencies and suggest that the entire conversation be cited.
