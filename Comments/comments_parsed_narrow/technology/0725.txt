There are also locally hosted options that approach the effectiveness of ChatGPT. [This GLM](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B/blob/main/README_en.md) for example was specifically trained to be able to be processed on a single consumer grade GPU

There aren't any quite as refined as GPT 4 but they're making strides roughly as quickly as these larger models are. I expect this to be the future of GLMs, especially if one of the big players gets caught inappropriately using customer data in the near future
