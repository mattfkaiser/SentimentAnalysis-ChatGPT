Just goes to show you that the general public is not ready to use these technologies, and don’t understand what it is. I’m not a “anti msm” conspiracy goof but journalists have largely dropped the ball on reporting about the capabilities of current generation of AI.

For the public’s interest, it would be great if OpenAI had a warning the first time you sign up saying ChatGPT is not an expert system with only vetted information and does it’s best to validate everything it says as true. Between this moron and the TX professor that failed his class because chatgpt told him it wrote all his student’s essay, even professionals are easily fooled as to the capabilities and underlying “ai” algorithms. I bet you could easily manipulate folks with a chat bit too…
