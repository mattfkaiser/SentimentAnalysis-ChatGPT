Pretty much. ChatGPT says whatever looks right, not necessarily what is right. If you ask it to provide sources, it will. If you try to check the sources, you'll discover that they're entirely made up. It's great for writing cover letters or an outline for a marketing plan. It's terrible for teaching you about a new subject.
