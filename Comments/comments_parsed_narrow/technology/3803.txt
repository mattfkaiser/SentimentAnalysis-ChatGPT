> It's showing genuine intuition and understanding of concepts of some description

It's really not. It screws up *extremely* simple concepts. You're wearing blinders if you think it's got genuine intuition and understanding.

Here's me asking it to find an obvious bug in this Python code and it gives an incorrect description:

> Is there a bug in this code?

    ```python
    # If the word man is in the sentence, log a message
    for word in sentence:
        if 'man' in word:
            print("Man found")
    ```

ChatGPT:

> However, based on the code as written, if sentence is a string, it will raise a TypeError when you try to iterate over the individual characters in the string. If sentence is a list of strings, the code will only match the exact string "man", not substrings like "woman" or "manners".

The last sentence is completely wrong, it's backwards. The `in` operator in Python will match substrings, it's not an equality check.

That bug *comes* from code ChatGPT spit out in an answer to another question.

Tweak the prompt to include `sentence = ["I", "am", "a", "woman"]`, and ChatGPT will confidently tell you there is no bug:

> No, there is no bug in this code.

EDIT: It's explanation is even more wrong than I noticed at first.

> However, based on the code as written, if sentence is a string, it will raise a TypeError when you try to iterate over the individual characters in the string.

This is incorrect, and trivial to test in Python. You can absolutely iterate over the characters in a string with a for loop, there will be no `TypeError`.
