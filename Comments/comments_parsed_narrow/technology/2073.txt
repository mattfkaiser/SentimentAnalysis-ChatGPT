I just discussed using GPT to move towards a more proof of concept approach for an idea I came up with last year in an undergrad, in my current class (Plus the Prof was nice enough to allow me to build onto the original idea in that class). The original is mine, however I do not have access to an  interdisciplinary team to slowly put it together. Mine was ChatGPT. Although, I canâ€™t imagine it to even touch actual schoolwork, with the exception of databases. Which is what my research assistant prompt is for, since it loves providing governmental and scholarly resources.
