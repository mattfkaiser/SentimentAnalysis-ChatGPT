I wrote a shader for a game engine, took me about 3 hours.

Later I thought I'd see what the fuss was about, and asked ChatGPT to write the same thing for me. It spat it out in about 5 seconds. I was gobsmacked.

It compiled, but didn't do what I wanted. Still, was impressive.

I asked it to write a 2nd shader to do something else but haven't tested it yet.

It was very convincing that it would do what it should. It even told me the limitations and then corrected the code when I asked it to fix the limitations. But yea still, didn't do what I asked for in the first place.
