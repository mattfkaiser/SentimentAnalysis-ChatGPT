I hate to laugh at someone else's pain, but this attorney deserves what they get.

They thought they found a shortcut in actually doing the work. 

One day AI will be ready for that, but we're not there yet. 

ChatGPT also makes it abundantly clear that answers are not to be trusted and must be researched further. 

I just find it rather amusing that a software algorithm out-bullshitted a lawyer. What a time to be alive.
