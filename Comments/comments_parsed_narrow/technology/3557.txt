That may be true, but if someone is just trying to make a buck, they donâ€™t care. I saw a guy promoting ChatGPT by making it write a right wing story about a boy and his dog and the American flag, use another AI illustrator to make pictures, send it to Amazon publishing. Magnify his idea by the thousands and you can see where this is going. Kind of like how Ebay is flooded with cheap knockoffs? Same shit
