I just began working in a highly technical field of precision manufacturing. It's the first time I'm being asked as an engineer to manage teams, present information to leadership, and make critical decisions that affect the outcome of my projects. The possibility for extravagant failure is closer than ever and the stakes are very high, millions of dollars are on the line constantly.

All my previous work experience and studies at university largely focused on being technically proficient in whatever topic. I excelled in problem solving and did so mostly on my own because often times my teammates were less aware of the path to a solution. I won contests and awards along the way, completed all sorts of amazing feats of engineering and never had to really communicate my process or plans.

Now, I'm in a position where my ability to communicate is nearly just as important as my technical skill, and I'm floundering. Giving big presentations in front of 20 managers and being asked to answer complex questions is so intimidating and nothing in my past has prepared me for it. I've improved a lot in the last year but it's going to be a long difficult road ahead training myself to be confident in speaking at length. 

I guess what I'm trying to express here is the utter necessity to be able to communicate at a high level, even in a field like manufacturing engineering. Writing is the basis for all communication. Without writing skills I would be absolutely useless and I've seen engineers who have little to no written ability nor can they draft or draw out their ideas let alone explain them. Poor guys have been failed by the system and tools like chatGPT are just going to make it worse.
