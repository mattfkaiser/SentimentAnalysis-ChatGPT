I have a bet with a coworker (both of us are in sales) around which one of us can sign a new client first. Weâ€™re using our normal sales process, but the rule is all back-and-forth over email needs to be done on chatgpt and we can only correct major grammar/spelling issues or anything misleading about our tech and pricing.
