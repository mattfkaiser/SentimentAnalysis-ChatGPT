And yet I have a feeling that you would have a difficult time adapting answers from StackOverflow if you didn't know what a for loop was.  Not to mention that somebody had to figure out how to solve that problem first before it could be put up on Stack Overflow.

Ironically, Stackoverflow had to [ban users from using ChatGPT](https://stackoverflow.com/help/gpt-policy) to provide answers because the answers were frequently misleading and confidently incorrect.  This is a direct example of the dangers of using technology as a crutch.  Yes, ChatGPT is a very useful tool, and in the hands of an expert it can be used to accelerate various coding tasks.  But it is also a very dangerous tool in the hands of an amateur who doesn't have an intuitive understanding of the results that ChatGPT produces.
