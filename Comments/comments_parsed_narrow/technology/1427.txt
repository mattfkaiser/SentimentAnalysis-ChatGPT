Chat GPT was not released in january 2022.

You artificially compare where base model started to train with release of GPT4.

Secondly OpenAI isn't jesus. Their word isn't sacred.

Especially due to what happened with release of LLAMA. In span of nearly a month we went from LLMs requiring super server farm worth of 100s millions to one consumer grade GPU to train and interfere.

Just last week new model was released with 65k context limit a lot higher than even GPT4 and works like 2-3 times faster.
