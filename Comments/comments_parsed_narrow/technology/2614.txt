There's also the issue that ChatGPT writes in a very generic tone.  You might not pick it up from reading one or two essays written by ChatGPT, but after you read a few, it starts to stick out.

It ends up sounding like a 4chan kid trying to sound like he's an expert on a subject he's only vaguely familiar with.

It might be a problem for high school teachers, but high school is basically just advanced day-care anyway.  For post-secondary teachers, they should be able to pick up on it pretty quickly and should be able to identify any paper written by ChatGPT.

It's also not like this is a new problem like people are pretending it is.  There have been essay-writing services around for decades.  You can get a college-level essay on just about any subject for like $30.  If you need something custom-written, it's like $100 and takes a couple of days (maybe this has nosedived recently due to ChatGPT lol).  The only novel thing about it is that you can get an output in near real-time, so you could use it to cheat during an exam.  For in-person exams with proctors, it should be pretty easy to prohibit its use.
