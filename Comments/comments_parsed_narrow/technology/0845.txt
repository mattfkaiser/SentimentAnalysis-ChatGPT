>Makers of artificial-intelligence tools such as ChatGPT would be required to disclose copyright material used in building their systems, according to a new draft of European Union legislation slated to be the Westâ€™s first comprehensive set of rules governing the rollout of AI.

>Such an obligation would give publishers and content creators a new weapon to seek a share of profits when their works are used as source material for AI-generated content by tools like ChatGPT. 

>The issue has been one of the thorniest commercial questions to emerge amid a frenzy of AI-powered tools being launched or tested by the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc.
