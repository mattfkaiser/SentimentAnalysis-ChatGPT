Correction: AI (not necessarily ChatGPT - too short-sighted) will break labor. Capitalism will continue forward at full speed ahead. If anything it will be more prosperous than ever as more and more jobs are able to be performed by machines. 

It is the working class that will be absolutely fucked but that's fine. Capitalism was never meant to work in our favor anyway. It just holds up better in the modern era than the old feudal method of "I should have all the money because God said so."
