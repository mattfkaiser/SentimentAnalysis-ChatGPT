And yet civilization keeps “advancing.” 

I’m here if we want to discuss whether we are better off overall. There’s decent evidence that switching from nomadic life to agriculture in general (a major accelerator in civilization) made us weaker and less healthy on an individual basis, even though it allowed for larger societies more capable of spreading.
It’s an interesting discussion. But the accepted paradigm is that forward and upward is good. To that point end, I don’t see Chat GPT, or iPads or calculators, or the abacus, making us dumber, just changing what it means to be smart and allowing us to do greater things faster. (Again, it is a separate discussion whether that is good for us).
