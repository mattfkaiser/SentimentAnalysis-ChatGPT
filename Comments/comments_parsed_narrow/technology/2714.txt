Tax exams have some math, but the key to getting the right answer on them is the issue spotting. I went to this school and had one of the paper's authors for both tax and benefits. 

Issue spotting is what the AI seems to be most terrible at from reading the paper. Issue spotting the most important part of graduating law school and is slightly important for passing the bar. It's kinda the first step in practice too. 

Also the bar exam is/would be easy for AI. It doesn't test what attorneys do in practice. In fact, because it's all memorization, it's literally the opposite of how law should be practiced. 

I was never one to brag while in law school, but I can honestly say I smoked ChatGPT on these exams. However, we both sucked at torts more than anything else.
