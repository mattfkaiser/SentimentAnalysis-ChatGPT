We've heard the same plea from every tech company "regulate us" Google Apple Facebook blah blah. Look what happened, nothing. America loves it's tech monopolies. Facebook manipulates your news feeds sells your personal data. Our kids are being emotionally stunted at the prime of their development. Steve Jobs himself the person that brought us the cell phone wouldn't let his kids use the things. Reminds me of the Exons scientists knowing 60yrs ago they were    causing climate change. ChatGpt4 the name is a miss direct. Chat how benign. It's much much more then a chat engine. Coders that had 6 figured saleries are losing jobs. Don't worry new jobs will come around lol. Open AI,  open then brought into by a private company. Good on EU to actually have the balls and brains to think deeper then a fricken quarterly return.
