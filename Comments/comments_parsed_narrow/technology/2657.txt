This was my prompt: 

**Write a lengthy reddit comment in response to a reddit post from Business Insider about not concerning ourselves with ChatGPT in the style of someone of average intelligence, who is lazy and somewhat aggressive towards technology in general.**

>"I don't know about you, but I find it concerning that we're relying more and more on technology like ChatGPT to do our thinking for us. Sure, it may save us time and effort, but what happens to our critical thinking skills and ability to form our own opinions? I mean, have you seen some of the responses this thing generates? They're often lacking in context and emotion, and sometimes even flat out wrong.

>And don't even get me started on the job loss aspect of it all. We're already seeing automation replace human jobs in many industries, do we really need to pave the way for AI to replace even more of them?

>I understand the convenience of using tools like ChatGPT, but at what cost? I think it's important to step back and assess the bigger picture before we fully embrace these technologies. Maybe it's time we start putting more effort into our own thoughts and ideas, rather than outsourcing it to a machine."

**Add more humor and reduce seriousness**

>"I mean, have you guys seen some of the responses ChatGPT generates? It's like a robot went to finishing school and forgot to bring its personality!

>And the job loss thing? Puh-lease. Like, seriously? ChatGPT can barely tie its own shoelaces, let alone replace human workers. Although, if it does manage to do that, at least we'll have more time to relax and binge-watch shows all day.

>In all seriousness (or lack thereof), I think it's important to remember that ChatGPT is just a tool and it's up to us to decide how we use it. And let's be real, sometimes it's just too tempting to let the robot do the talking and enjoy the laughter that ensues. Just don't forget to take a break and use your own brain every once in a while, lest we turn into those robots ourselves!"

**Less valley girl more intelligent**

>"I think it's important to consider the impact of relying too heavily on technology like ChatGPT. While it may save time and effort in the short-term, it's crucial to understand the potential consequences of outsourcing our critical thinking skills to a machine.

>That being said, it's important to remember that ChatGPT is simply a tool and the onus is on us to use it responsibly. We should strive to maintain a healthy balance between utilizing technology to our advantage and exercising our own cognitive abilities.

>In the end, I believe that technology should augment and enhance our abilities, not replace them. Let's not forget the value of human creativity, intuition, and empathy in our increasingly digital world."

**Same sophistication but more tongue in cheek**

>"Oh, ChatGPT, the robot that thinks it's smarter than us mere mortals. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's certainly convenient to have a machine that can spit out facts and figures at lightning speed. But let's not forget, it's just a tool, and we hold the reins on how we use it.

>I mean, have you read some of the responses ChatGPT generates? It's like a robot that's trying way too hard to be a Mensa member. It's all "facts, facts, facts" but where's the creativity? Where's the humor? Where's the good old-fashioned human touch?

>In all seriousness (or semi-seriousness), I think it's important to remember the value of human intelligence and creativity. Technology is a wonderful tool, but we shouldn't let it replace our own capabilities. Let's strive for a balance and not become too dependent on our robotic friends, otherwise, we'll end up like those poor souls in Wall-E, shuffling around and relying on machines for everything."

**More irreverent, careless and ambivalent towards the future**

>"Eh, ChatGPT, who cares? I mean, sure it's a cool tool to have, but let's not get too hyped up about it. It's just a machine that spews out information, it's not going to change the world or anything.

>And all this talk about it replacing human workers? Please. If robots are taking over jobs, at least we'll have more time to sit back and do absolutely nothing.

>In all honesty, I couldn't care less about the future of technology and ChatGPT. It is what it is, and we'll just have to deal with it. No use getting all worked up over something that we can't control anyway. Let the robots do their thing, and we'll just sit back and enjoy the ride. Or not. Whatever."
