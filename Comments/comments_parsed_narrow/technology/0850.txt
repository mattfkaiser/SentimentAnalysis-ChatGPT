We are talking about EU law here. The EU Intellectual Property Office is very clear on this subject:

*4. What is copyright infringement? Can I get in trouble for copyright infringement? What if I wasn't aware that I infringed something protected by copyright?*

***If you use another person’s copyrightable work in a way that is covered by the exclusive rights and without being granted permission, you infringe copyright.*** *For instance, downloading a work from the internet to a computer is covered by the right of reproduction. However, downloading from the internet does not always constitute infringement. Thus, downloading a work to a computer does not constitute infringement if the work has already been uploaded to the internet and made available to the public with the permission of the author. In this case, downloading to a personal computer qualifies as lawful private copying. However, in cases where the work has been uploaded without the author’s permission, the work has been made available to the public unlawfully, and hence the subsequent download of the work will also be unlawful. Sometimes it is difficult to ascertain whether a work available on the internet is lawful or unlawful. Someone who makes another person’s copyrightable work available for the public, for instance by uploading it to a private and freely available website, will always be infringing copyright unless permission has been obtained. The person who infringes copyright may be subject to various legal remedies and sanctions,, the most important of which, in practice, are injunctions and the award of damages. Damages cannot be awarded unless the infringer was aware or ought to have been aware that the act in question constituted infringement (bona fide). However, lack of knowledge of the valid legal rules cannot exempt the infringer from liability. In practice, this means that one of the few situations in which an internet user can be exempted from liability because of lack of knowledge is where the internet user genuinely had no knowledge or responsibility for the fact that the works in question had been made available to the public unlawfully.*

Edit: On your point of 'synopsis' you are wrong there too. You HAVE to credit the original author/creator. This is why on YouTube you can play music for 'review and critique' purposes as long as you clearly state who's work you are reviewing and even then if the original creator does not approve they can have it taken down (copyright strike). 

You are blurring the line between learning and copying and it is absolutely not the case that ChatGPT or other LLMs are 'learning', once you break down the framework of algorithms it is very clear that they are copying and synthesising original material in new format. And that original material is protected by copyright in many cases, unless explicitly stated that it is not (CC).
