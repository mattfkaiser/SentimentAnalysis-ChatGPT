I would say that people say AI can never reason also don't understand how the human brain works and is probably working with an extremely ill defined version of 'reasoning'.

Maybe ChatGPT cannot reason actually, but this line is going to become more and more blurrier. 

I remember so many people when Go AI was getting stronger and stronger would say things like, it can never be good, because it lacks the human intuition, reasoning, and beauty of mind. They were crushed.
