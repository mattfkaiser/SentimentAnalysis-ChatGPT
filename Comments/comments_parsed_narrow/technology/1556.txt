Let them cheat. You still have to edit the chatGPT output to make sure it answers the assignment, and students who don't do this will do worse. Also, non-cheaters will still do better on in-person assignments, so the curve should remain intact. 

Alternatively, basic level long form expository composition is the only thing being made obsolete by chatGPT. This skill is basically irrelevant for most people in a vacuum, and is valuable as a proxy for learning critical reading and thinking as well as organizing an argument. It's not prohibitively hard to design other proxies for learning these deeper soft skills. 

Analogy from math pedagogy: Wolfram Alpha makes crunching 40 calculus problems obsolete, but it doesn't obsolete critical thinking to turn a word problem into a system of ODEs. A good student recognizes that practice problems are a tool for success, not the end goal. A good student only uses Wolfram as a learning aid. A good student will still do better on a hard exam involving more abstract problems with concrete solutions.
