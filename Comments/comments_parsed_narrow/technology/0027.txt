ChatGPT has no memory. The default web-based UI simulates memory by appending your prompt to an array and sending the full array to the API every time you write a new prompt/message. The sum of the lengths of the messages in the array has a cap, based on the number of “tokens” (1 token is roughly equal to 0.75 word). So if your conversation is too long (not based on the number of messages, but the total number of words/tokens in all your prompts and all its answers) it will simply cut off from the beginning of the conversation. To you it seems like it has forgotten the language, but in reality it is possible that this information is simply not part of the request triggering the “wrong” answer. I highly recommend any developer to read the API docs to gain a better understanding of how it works, even if only using the web-based UI.
