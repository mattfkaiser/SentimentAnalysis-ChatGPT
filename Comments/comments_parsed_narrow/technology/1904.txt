I asked it how to get a certain pokémon variant in a 2002 pokémon game knowing the process which is pretty convoluted and it confidently spat out the most incorrect stuff.

It just seemed so vapid in the way it was spitting out these sentences that sounded so good but were completely wrong.

Doing that is what took the wool from over my eyes in regards to ChatGPT. Feels like just another chat bot to me now. Super useful and much more advanced than what we had 5 years ago but it doesn’t feel as magical to me anymore.

It actually made me wary of using it for topics that I don’t have much knowledge of.
