They really went too far with ChatGPT. It's so afraid of being problematic, in order to explore anything interesting you need to give it so many instructions and qualifiers to get it to actually respond instead of giving a speech about why that isn't a good thing to talk about, you end up filling its very small memory with that, instead of the actual topic.

I wouldn't call it "woke", it's definitely "afraid". Even to the extent that it isn't very woke - try talking to it about the morality of capitalism / what could be done to potentially limit its negative aspects, and it will go on about how anything short of anarcho-capitalism is unethical
