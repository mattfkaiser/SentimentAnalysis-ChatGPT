I’ve always said it like this, if you’re a knowledgeable professional and ask ChatGPT a question, you will be heavily impressed by the answers or can give. It seems incredibly useful. Sometimes it gives bad answers but you quickly notice those issues and correct them. Awesome!

But what if you didn’t know what a bad answer was? What if you didn’t review each answer for validity?
