I remember when my school tried to ban kids from using Wikipedia as a source when writing papers. However, Wikipedia proved to be an invaluable starting point for research with the pointers to sources being the true research goldmine. ChatGPT is similar in that it summarizes information in approachable, digestible chunks. It would be nice if ChatGPT had a function to reveal its sources for people to do their own in-depth research. A starting point, not the destination for research.
