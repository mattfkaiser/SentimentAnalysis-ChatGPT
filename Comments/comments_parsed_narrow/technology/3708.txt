That might work but to be clear, legally speaking, an editor nor a proofreader is granted the rights of an author. These texts would be authored by an AI so anyone in the future can seize the unprotected works. One could write a book with ChatGPT and hire humans to proofread and edit the work but it would not be legal to claim another party as the author, for sake of copyright since the original author cannot be granted the copyright it becomes public domain immediately upon creation.  As the law exists now. This may change through litigation and future rulings or legislation.
