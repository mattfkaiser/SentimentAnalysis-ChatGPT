I think it will affect their revenue a lot because if Microsoft has something in ChatGPT integration that is comparable to Google’s, which Bing is currently not, then they’ll at the very least get some of Google’s market share in search. Google currently has an almost complete monopoly on search so they can set ad auction prices at whatever they want because they’re the only real player in the space, but if Microsoft plays it right they can take even a bit more of that share and that will force Google to lower CPCs to compete. Plus the current DOJ suit against Google could potentially break up their advertising from owning both the buy and sell side, so it will get very interesting in terms of how much Google will still be able to fuck over advertisers.
