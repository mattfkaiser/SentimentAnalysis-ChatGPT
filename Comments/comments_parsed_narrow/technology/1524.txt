I don't doubt. Some of my students don't proofread the writing THEY do. I have zero faith that those kids would proofread something an AI wrote when the entire scam is to avoid work.

This will not improve until teachers have access to systems to detect AI-written work. If ChatGPT really cared about academic integrity, then they would cooperate and provide systems to teachers to detect AI written work.

Otherwise all us teachers will be waiting for Google Classroom to incorporate an "AI Detection" add-odd. It fucking sucks.
