>What do we do when you can ask a computer to make porn of some random person you know and it can actually do it?

This is already possible.

People also seem to lack the understanding that not all AI is public, not all of it is popular, and a lot of it is obscure with varying levels of usage and capability, and people develop this even without monetary incentive much like people may develop cracks for video games or whatever. Many can also be used in conjunction to get what you desire. Even ChatGPT isn't current to what they have in the works.

For example I might use a base image of someone, use Stable diffusion Img2Img in-painting, with a model trained on a dataset trained on pornographic images to remove clothing. Or use a pornographic image, maybe even completely generated by an AI prompt describing something I'd like, and use a face swapping AI, then a face improving AI.
