Reposting my reply for visibility because people seem to think tech companies can just launch these kinds of services for free for philanthropy:

If I have to guess, (Google launched this only now) because this actually somewhat hurts their existing business model. Google now has to shift its existing search / Ads business model to accommodate Bard. A service like this requires tremendous amount of engineering effort. And no business is going to invest this kind of money when it hurts their existing business for no reason.

Unless there is a viable competition i.e ChatGPT
