I’m a developer, and I use ChatGPT about every day. 

He’s absolutely lying. It sucks pretty bad at programming. It can give you the general structure, but it struggles with anything serious. 

It’s basically only good for skipping some simple googles. If I need a simple command, or a quick way to do something, it’ll give it to me a lot faster than google

It is wrong a lot though, and you have to spend time validating what it tells you in a lot of cases since it’ll lie. It’s definitely sent me down the wrong path before and wasted a couple hours

It’s at most a 15% efficiency bump to an engineer
