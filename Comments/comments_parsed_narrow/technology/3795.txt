My vote is on extremely unreliable... I pasted in my resume (which was written by ChatGPT with some prompting) and it classified it as "Not AI Generated"

The trick is to ask ChatGPT to write out something based on bulletpoints (or in this case, I fed in what I currently have and asked it to rewrite it in a more concise, professional format making me look smarter, lol) and directed ChatGPT to make changes in certain spots to reflect my experiences and background.
