I taught high school math resource room, so kids who struggled. Kids could use graphing calculators for everything. There were so many kids who could not even type a simple equation in. They couldn't see that they had hit the parenthesis twice. Or mistyped a number. The executive function skills and attention to detail were just not there. They would have the same difficulties with ChatGPT. These technologies only help people who are already far ahead of the people who actually need the help.
