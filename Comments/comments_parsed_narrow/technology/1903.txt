That's not true. You can not know the answer to something but be able to spot an incorrect answer. If I don't know what the the scientific name of a fruit fly is and ask ChatGPT, I will know it is wrong if it responds with "Home sapien". You do have to know enough about a subject to ask it the right follow-up questions though.
