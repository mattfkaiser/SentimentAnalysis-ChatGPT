Doesn't it seem fairly simple to just hand type the AI's output in random intervals and then go through and do the editing?

I wonder if the issue is that a paper may not be a good way to evaluate knowledge. ChatGPT is ultimately just a really good bullshit generator and so the fact that a bullshit generator is successfully passing your class could be a clue that you're not evaluating what you think you're evaluating.
