>Anyone savvy enough to proofread and edit their essays knows how to paraphrase and reword them so that they don't get caught. 

I'd throw out the caveat that to be able to do this properly often requires as much as, if not more of an understanding of the topic than writing a basic non-plagiarised version. 

Now the preference should always be to have some kind of oral test to verify the understanding, but being able to parse the results of ChatGPT, fix errors and proof read it requires an understanding of its own.
