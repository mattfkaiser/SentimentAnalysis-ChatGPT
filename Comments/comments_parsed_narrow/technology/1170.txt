It's amazing at coding. I think that's it's greatest abilities. No more searching for random libraries to do what your trying to do or scrolling through stack exchange for an error code where a bunch of snarky assholes give explanations that make no sense and then trying to puzzle how to incorporate the solution into your program, chatgpt can just straight up do it or at least set you on the right track, and it does it instantly.
