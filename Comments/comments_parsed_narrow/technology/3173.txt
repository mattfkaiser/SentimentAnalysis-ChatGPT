So people have confusion about ChatGPT. It’s a text bot but also a platform others can use how ever the fuck they want if they have permission. This firm has that permission for research reasons.

Edit - this core will eventually become part of ChatGPT. To say it’s a different product isn’t entirely true. This is ChatGPT, it’s just not prime time yet and this research is a step.

For those not a fan of my simplification... I don't care. Write a better one. I can guarantee you most people have no idea what you're talking about with AI cores.
