The average worker just works, they have 0 controlling interest in the big companies that employ them. They own no say. The ppl on top always looking to make more and it's only done in 5 or so ways. 1. Charge more for the same thing, 2. produce the same thing with less/inferior materials ,3. 1 and 2 combined and lastly, steal it from the workers pocket. There's millions of people just born that will not have a chance to do anything because technology has outpaced human labor output. Even if the minimum wage would be lowered to 50 cents an hour it would still be too expensive. The next 30 years will be the darkest humanity will see. ChatGPT will eliminate all the outsourced labor that was deemed too expensive for American workers. Thought 2 bucks an hour for a call center job in South America was exploitative? Wait til they all get the axe cause 2 bucks an hour is now too expensive and a computer now does it for 0. The human toll of suffering has still not been calculated correctly by the world's top minds. All the money saved on labor will manifest in higher share prices. The consumer is not going to enjoy by spending X% LESS on said stuff. They will pay the same if not MORE and get a big F you from the suit at the top.
