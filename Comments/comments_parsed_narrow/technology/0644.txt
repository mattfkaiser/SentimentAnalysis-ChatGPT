Fair enough. I mis-remembered the questions I typed in. I've been studying ChatGPT for a research paper and several mention that ChatGPT has a limited number of languages trained on. 

I asked it "List the programming languages that ChatGPT is trained for. " and got back a list of 20. 

But there was no reason to downvote me because you didn't like my answer.
