I doubt it. I would agree with most google things but AI cuts directly into Googles core business (search), and if they're not able to compete with that (chatGPT is only the beginning) it could mean their dominance in search is over. So this is one of the few things I think Google won't budge on unless they're ready to lose their monopoly in the internet search business.
