>The problem is refusal to update an education & economic system built around memorization, which is no longer nearly as useful as problem solving, critical thinking

The problem is that ChatGPT automates away the problem-solving and critical thinking parts of school assignments. Turning everything into "how to prompt the AI" is not even remotely exercising the same thinking skills as the work it replaces.

>there is no longer any point wasting your limited brain capacity carrying around information beyond what you need to know right now to do your current task, and how to ask the right questions.

No. It's still useful to know things. You can't really work fluently in a complex topic or develop insights about something without a pretty deep base of knowledge about it in your head. We operate all the time based on information we don't have to go and look up. The internet has reduced the utility of certain kinds of memorized knowledge (mostly trivial details), but some people are acting like it makes learning about major subjects practically unnecessary, and that's insane.
