University teachers should take a multi-faceted approach to combat cheating caused by the use of AI language models like ChatGPT.

First, they should educate their students about the dangers and consequences of using these tools to cheat. This includes not only the academic repercussions, but also the ethical and moral implications of using AI to deceive others.

Second, teachers should incorporate new technologies and techniques into their assessments to make it harder for students to cheat. For example, using plagiarism detection software, creating open-book exams, or using oral or visual assessments.

Third, teachers should encourage a culture of academic integrity among their students by setting clear expectations and consequences for cheating, and by recognizing and rewarding students who uphold academic integrity.

Fourth, teachers should also be aware of red flags that may indicate cheating, such as sudden and drastic improvements in performance, and take appropriate action when necessary.

Finally, teachers should be aware of the limitations of AI language models like ChatGPT and understand that the model can only generate text based on the information it has been trained on. Therefore, students will not be able to generate new information or understand the content in-depth.

Overall, university teachers must be proactive in their efforts to combat cheating caused by AI language models like ChatGPT, and they must be willing to adapt and evolve their strategies as the technology continues to advance.
