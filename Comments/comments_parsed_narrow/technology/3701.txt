I can see lible lawsuits not being covered by insurance because nobody did a verification of the AI product.  Another issue is of you can copyright an AI's work.  If your competitor products something very similar to what you've put published, and you've both used AI (maybe even the same product), will you sue and risk being found out?  You know somebody is going to outsource to chatGPT, charge a client, and cause this to happen.
