Not exactly, google finds already written articles. Chat GPT uses information from a multitude of online sources to compose an "original" answer to a prompt, same as if a human went through and read a bunch of articles and then summarized them into a response except much quicker and it has no concept of "truth," it just knows what a response from a human would look like and writes in that style.
