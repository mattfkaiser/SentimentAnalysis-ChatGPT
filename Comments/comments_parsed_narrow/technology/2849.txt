I don't think many people in this thread have used ChatGPT. It can write essays for you, but it will only be good if you feed it the facts it needs to know, go paragraph by paragraph, and then tell it to correct any potential mistakes. The final format can definitely look good, but it still requires work on the students end. It's not like you can say write me an essay about the american revolution and get a good essay. It definitely speeds up the process but it's not in the state to completley remove any work for the student.
