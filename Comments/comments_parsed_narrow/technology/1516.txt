Yeah, a worry with this mess is that the builder of the technology (ChatGPT) evidently doesn’t understand the effects of their creation.  If they don’t understand the effects, they can’t perform a root cause analysis to figure out why those effects exist, and then address those causes.  

What they’ll likely do instead is just more of what’s in the interview: make more problematic software to compensate for our other problematic software.

Curious to see how this pans out.  Interestingly disruptive technology.
