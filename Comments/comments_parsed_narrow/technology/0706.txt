I am not talking about trades or jobs that require a physical presence. Digital artists, accountants, auditors, programmers, customer service call centers, R&D, Wall Street, etc. anyone who works behind a desk and relies on computers to do their jobs are slated for extinction. 

For example my sister works in financial compliance. Her department has 6 people. Everyone works 80 hour weeks every end of quarter and tax time for weeks on end. ChatGPT will make it require 1, the lead accountant who signs off on the paperwork, and those quarterly reports will be done in minutes and everyone else will be given the boot. The productivity gains of 1 person with AI will eliminate multiple jobs. 

And the corporations wonâ€™t save us because it will absolutely become an arms race for AI capabilities, race to bottom in costs and race to the stratosphere in profits. At some inflection point companies will end up out of business **not** going hard and fast on AI rollout and shedding the unnecessary humans.
