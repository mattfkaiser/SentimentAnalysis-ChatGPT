The bad press from the chat bot wasnt just that it was praising Hitler or being racist it was because it did it on Twitter. People have got Chatgpt to say all kinds of things and it hasn't been broken down. I think as long as they avoid giving it its own official account on a social media network then it should be good. You can use Google to look up hate speech and all sorts of stuff. Is Google bad because of that? No. This AI is being touted as a tool and not a fake teenage girl who wants to be the internet friend like Tay was.
