The real strange thing is that if I read cited cases by another attorney that I couldn’t find, I’d assume that they got a name wrong or the reporter wrong.

Like if they cited *Smith v. Johnson*, 104 So.3d 718 (La. 2019) and I could find it, then I’d try maybe 104 So.2d 718, or maybe 718 was the pin cite and it was actually 714 (though Westlaw would’ve caught that). Or maybe it was Smith v. Thompson (but again Westlaw would’ve caught it).

So after not finding it and trying a few alternatives, I’d just call them and ask what it was supposed to be, because never would I think “well they just made that up.” Now I’ll have to think about if they used ChatGPT and didn’t check it…
