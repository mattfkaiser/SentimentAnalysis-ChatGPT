Slightly unrelated note, but why does this subreddit constantly seem outraged?

I thought r/technology would celebrate steps forward in technology. However this subreddit singlehandedly seems to dunk on technological progress in a way that completely goes against it's name lol. Should rename this sub to r/techsucks or r/badtech. 

Yeah, ChatGPT has some controversies associated with it. But can we appreciate how far NLP has come? Think about how much this software could revolutionize the healthcare industry, and how it'd make it easier to keep medical documentation for instance. It's so stressful as a healthcare provider to keep medical records. If ChatGPT can do that for you, it gives the provider more time to focus on the patient and less time being a number-cruncher. 

What about how much ChatGPT will help people who don't speak English as a 2nd language? 

TL;DR There are so many good things about ChatGPT and technological progress. Can we focus some more on that instead?
