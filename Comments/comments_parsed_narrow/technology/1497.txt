I’m a high school English teacher, so I feel the concern right now. 

I’m happy to incorporate higher level thinking and more complex tasks, ones that couldn’t be cheated with AI, but frankly, my students aren’t ready for information that complicated. They need to be able to master the basics in order to evaluate complicated ideas and see if chatGPT is even accurate. 

We just finished reading MacBeth. Students had to complete an essay in class examining what factors led to Macbeth’s downfall. This is a very simple prompt. We read and watched the play together in class. We kept a note page called “Charting MacBeth’s Downfall” that we filled out together at the end of each act. I typically would do this as a take home essay, but due to chatGPT, it was an in class essay. 

The next day, I gave the students essays generated by chatGPT and asked them to identify inconsistencies and errors in the essay (there were many!!) and evaluate the accuracy. Students worked in groups. If *this* had been my test, students would have failed. The level of knowledge and understanding needed to figure that out was way beyond my simple essay prompt. For a play they have spent only 3 weeks studying, they are not going to have a super in depth analysis.
