I agree. It's definitely formulaic, and if it were turned in it certainly wouldn't get a very good grade for an advanced English course, but that doesn't mean its bones aren't sufficient for a skilled editor to give it some meat.

The prompt I gave it was:

 "a travel memoir about a man that falls in love with a woman in a striped blue dress with a small patch in the Italian Riviera over sandwiches before an alternation with her ex husband leads to the writer being in the hospital"

As you can see, I was responsible for essentially highlighting the beats of the story, chatGPT did the rest. It certainly is passable, but also highly formulaic.
