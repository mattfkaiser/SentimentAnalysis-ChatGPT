The key is we have integrated calculators into our education system, and don't shun them. They're a tool, and we have designed classes to use them, and also have strategies to prevent their use or limit their utility (such as showing your work).

ChatGPT is no different. It's a tool like high level math software. We just haven't adapted our education system yet. 

Same goes for word processors, spell check and grammar check etc.
