Should we expect tech companies to play peekaboo with their products? AI solutions like ChatGPT have been on the horizon for many years. People didn't believe it until a semi-viable public product was released. Should they now compromise their investments because the wider world didn't get their head out of their ass early enough? How much longer should we expect OpenAI and other researchers to wait for the backwaters of the world to adapt? It's been years already. They even restricted its use for almost as long to give people the chance to adapt to the coming changes.

ChatGPT isn't even as impressive as most people think, and it still caught some by surprise. Once AI can model its own knowledge and seek it out, all traditional homework will become obsolete.
