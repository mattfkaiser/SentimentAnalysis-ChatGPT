I’m a professional writer. Depending on the quality of the class, the fact is, ChatGPT could only ever write a C level paper.

ChatGPT writes in a very simplistic style, frequently is just barely (but noticeably) off the mark rhetorically, and inherently lacks an authentic voice.

And if you’re not putting in the effort to write the paper yourself, anyway, you won’t be able to spot ChatGPT making these errors in order to correct them.

And speaking as a professional writer, correcting ChatGPT is more work than doing it yourself, because that’s the nature of imbuing prose with voice.

I think people are making a grave mistake to think that it’s a good idea to outsource one’s writing to ChatGPT really in almost any case. (Except for a paper they’re happy to get a zero effort ‘C’ on.)

Sure, you can use ChatGPT to write your cover letter. Or that competitive scholarship essay. But you won’t be getting that job or that scholarship. Because ChatGPT pales in comparison to human writing on so many levels. 

Case in point, ever read someone’s ‘book’ written by ChatGPT? It’s worthless.

The prose is bland and borderline white noise. 

It’s definitely a ‘C’ level essay writer, don’t get me wrong. But that’s it. And its self sabotage to keep yourself limited for life at C level writing by relying on ChatGPT to write things for you.
