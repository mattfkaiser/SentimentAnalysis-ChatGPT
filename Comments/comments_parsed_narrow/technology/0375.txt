This very idea is the one that I came to comment about. I'm curious how students are **actually** using ChatGPT. I doubt all of them are just copying and pasting essays in full from ChatGPT and turning that in as their work.

I used ChatGPT recently to assist me in writing an essay. I still thought through my ideas, outlined my paper, and wrote each paragraph. I feed my paragraphs, one at a time, into ChatGPT to ask it to rewrite it. I still tweaked those paragraphs after that as well. 

I ended with an essay that was my ideas, my outline, and still mainly my own words. It was just cleaned up for readability by an AI.

I'm not saying everyone is using it like that, but I'm curious what the actual uses of ChatGPT are in colleges right now because I didn't use it to just copy a free and easy essay.
