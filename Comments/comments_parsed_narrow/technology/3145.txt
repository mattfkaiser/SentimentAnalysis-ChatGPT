OK, but you can't blame people for pointing out the weaknesses, by the standards of their own marketing, of the systems being sold today. ChatGPT is amazingly good at writing coherent responses to questions, but not yet designed to be factual. But the marketing is all about using it to learn about truths, whether the topic be history or politics or science or computer programming. The marketing doesn't fit the product, and we're calling out the discrepancy. That's not to say it's good for nothing, or that it can't get better.
