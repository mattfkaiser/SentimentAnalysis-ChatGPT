I have a coworker who would improve his writing greatly by using ChatGPT.

He spelled my bosses boss' name wrong, omits punctuation, just bad grammar in general. He misspelled my name "Joe" as "Joke" in a message. I'm 100% sure it wasn't a joke, just careless. ChatGPT is like anything else, I use it as a prompt, and then change things here and there.
