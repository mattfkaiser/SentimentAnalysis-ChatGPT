That depends on the subject. I've tested ChatGPT with some pretty esoteric knowledge and it's had very few errors. But yes, you have to work almost as hard getting any use out of it as you would writing it. 

If you had no idea of the subject you'd ask it to write about... yeah then you're likely screwed.
