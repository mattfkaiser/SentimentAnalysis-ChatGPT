Universities can’t predict the future needs of industry, so honestly it is useless to try. Universities provide a broad base of exposure within many areas of study, to provide the requisite context for any reasonably educated person to vet and debunk the output of a language model. 

At least as ChatGPT stands, it can replace content farms and clickbait, but just like google searches haven’t replaced quality research, it is not replacing quality writing. The reason it provides pleasantly surprising results to many of us is because we already have the requisite knowledge of what is good or makes sense, but in this case it is just confirming our priors, not formulating something new. Will it someday synthesize anything novel, or propose interesting questions it then answers, iteratively, to get somewhere actually cool? We will have to wait and see.
