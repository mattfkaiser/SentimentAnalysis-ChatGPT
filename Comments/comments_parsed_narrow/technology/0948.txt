I did kinda the exact opposite thing you're supposed to do with ChatGPT and fed it much of my wife's medical history trying to get ideas on some other tests to run.  I somewhat anonymized it - giving some general demographics.... but it recommended some tests that kinda make sense based on her history and symptoms - taking into account some of the medical issues she's been dealing with over the last year.

We're planning on bringing up the tests the next time we talk to her primary doctor.
