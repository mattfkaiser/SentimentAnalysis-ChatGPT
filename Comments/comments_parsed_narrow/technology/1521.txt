And by this point, the expectation is that one has already learned the things that the calculator is making easier. Higher level math ends up being more about knowing how to get to a result more than the result itself.

Using ChatGPT doesn't build on one's foundational knowledge, so using it to do things like writing essays just bypasses the entire exercise. Even those using it to create a basic report they then edit, you've already bypassed several foundational skills in writing by having a structure and outline provided. Using it in an educational setting undermines the point of education.
