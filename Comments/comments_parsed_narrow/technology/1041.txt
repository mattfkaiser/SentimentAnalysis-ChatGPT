this guy might be an asshole but he's doing a good thing. chatgpt definitely is ready for this type of application right now for common illnesses. i'm fucking sick of doctors being the gatekeepers of healthcare. medicine isnt magic. it's like everything else. anyone can learn it and understand it. it's time it's legal to buy medicine without a doctor. it's insane waiting 1 hr to see a doctor for 5 mins and pay out the ass for something any asshole could diagnose.
