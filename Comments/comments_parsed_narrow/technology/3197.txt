this is crazy if true. chatgpt got signed up to task rabbit. created and account by first creating an email . opened a bank account to get a credit card to pay for the service. browse the listings found a freelancer. paid him. 

this is revolutionary if you're fucking stupid. 

the humans provided everything and asked chatgpt to ai a response.
