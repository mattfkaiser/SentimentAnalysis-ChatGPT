I’m an RN in a specialty. A good bit of my job is giving advice these days. I tested chatGPT and it could replace me in a heart beat. It correctly answered even very specific very tricky questions. It even corrected me in some things which I’m nervously reading up on. Now my job is more complicated than giving advice. But they wouldn’t need me full time anymore. And that’s todays shitty generic version. You think  it can’t do math? Wait till they train it to be a college physics teacher. Honestly I wish they would shut the whole thing down. But that’s probably what the buggy whip people said
