I see similarities to using calculators. We all use them now. We aren't going back.  


If Chat GPT can get you to a baseline that you then have to spice up with actual sources and language that is appropriately yours - and we don't take advantage of it - someone else, somewhere else will and WE will be sitting in the past missing cursive and longford math.  


The AI is far from perfect. We should teach them how to use it appropriately and ethically and teaching them how to find their own voice and the value in it.
