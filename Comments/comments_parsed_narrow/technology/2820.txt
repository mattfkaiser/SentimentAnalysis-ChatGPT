IMO it's a tool like a calculator or excel. Like you can do some pretty crazy stuff with it as long as you audit it's work but if you have no idea what the steps are to get there you aren't going to be able to be sure it's accurate. It's a great tool for getting you started, same way that Excel is better than pencil and pen.

If you just chucked a bunch of numbers into excel and didn't do your syntax right the problem would be you and not the tool. Same property is present here IMO. ChatGPT is not the savior job killer, its another tool for the toolbox.
