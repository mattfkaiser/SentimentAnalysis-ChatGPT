Why is there never any discussion about the professors or the questions they are writing for their students? I am amazed by what ChatGPT can do, but it is possible to write questions that it cannot answer in a coherent way. Ex.: instead of asking the question “write an essay about the the aftermath of the American civil war” ask “write an essay about something from your life that was likely impacted by changes to American society in the anti bellum south” … basically questions that require the student to reflect on what they have learned not just regurgitate facts. Good teachers already do this!
