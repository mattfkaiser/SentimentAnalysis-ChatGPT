This article is full of shit. It can't point to any actual people who were fired and replaced by ChatGPT. It just conflates layoffs with the rise of adoption of the tech. Yes, 60% of companies are using it in some fashion to write code. But they aren't using it to write ALL of the code, it's just making life easier for SWEs. The code coming from ChatGPT is just code that we would have otherwise copied and pasted from Stack Overflow or from documentation otherwise.
