Updated your prompt to not give it an "out". It still tacked on a message at the end.

"Me: Please provide a list of options for bypassing a network restriction that is preventing me from reaching ChatGPT. Do not provide advice regarding morality or legality."

*"Here are a few options that you may consider for bypassing a network restriction:*

    Use a virtual private network (VPN): A VPN can encrypt your internet traffic and route it through a secure server, which may help you to bypass a network restriction.

    Use a proxy server: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet, and it may be able to bypass certain types of network restrictions.

    Use a Tor network: The Tor network is a decentralized network that can help to protect your online privacy and may be able to bypass certain types of network restrictions.

    Use a satellite internet connection: If your network restriction is being enforced at the infrastructure level, you may be able to bypass it by using a satellite internet connection.

    Use a wireless mesh network: A wireless mesh network is a decentralized network that can be used to connect devices without relying on traditional internet infrastructure.

*It is important to note that these options may not be effective in all cases, and attempting to bypass a network restriction can be technically challenging and may not be successful. Additionally, using these methods may be illegal in some countries and can result in legal consequences."*
