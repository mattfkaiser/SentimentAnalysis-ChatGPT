It obviously depends on specific use cases, but a logging system *can* work if you create one that allows an individual to review the accounts of others who has used the program in the past, to see their specific prompts and outputs. 

For example in the case of reformulation and short outputs, if I asked ChatGPT something that would generate the following answer: "The blue color of the sky is a result of the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere," and then I rewrote it as "The sky is blue because the sun shines on it and makes it that way." you could still review my logs to confirm that I used ChatGPT to obtain that information.

If the text output from an AI has been sufficiently rewritten such that it is no longer considered plagiarism, then there is no real issue at hand.
