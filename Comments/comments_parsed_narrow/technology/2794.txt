If you’re talking about the Tay chatbot (which is the closest thing I can think of) yes it used some kind of generative model. But as a *product* it is completely different from ChatGPT. Tay could only produce tweets and that was the only usecase. You have already seen by now the multiple different usecases for ChatGPT. There has never been a *product* and versatile toolkit like this, and nobody was chattering about being “replaced by robots” when Tay came out.
