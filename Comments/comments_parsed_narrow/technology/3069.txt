Honestly I think everything ChatGPT is doing has great potential. Why are we spending so much time making, say, a comp sci major memorize dates in history? Just to pass a test to "get to the next level"? It doesn't make much sense to me. Sure, maybe teach them surface level stuff, but IMO we need to reevaluate how we teach students with all the new technology we're getting.
