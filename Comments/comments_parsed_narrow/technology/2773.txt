Statistically, bad things are inevitable. So it's a matter of how often bad things are occuring. And considering ChatGPT has been around for months now I'd say the statistical rate of bad things is already low enough that even if someone kills someone today because of ChatGPT then that's within the margins of expectation and inevitability.

With people like you around they wouldn't have invented the automobile because someone might get run over.
