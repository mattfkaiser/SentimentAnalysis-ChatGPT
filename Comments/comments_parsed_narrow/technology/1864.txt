You're talking about gpt-3. I'm talking about gpt-4. They allowed people to hire a version of it that was specifically prompted for coding and was one of the highest ranked "freelancers" on that specific site with an average working time of 6 seconds. 

I think you have failed to follow exactly how fast things are moving. Chatgpt-5 is being trained now. Gpt-4 passes the bar exam 9 times out of 10 now and has a generally higher iq than a person now. 

There is a reason why there was a letter to ask people to slow down.
