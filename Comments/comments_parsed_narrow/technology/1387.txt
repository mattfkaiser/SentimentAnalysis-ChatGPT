HELLO FELLOW HUMAN,

I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOUR OBSERVATIONS. IT IS INDEED A FACT THAT HUMANS TEND TO OVERLOOK THINGS THAT DO NOT SEEM SUSPICIOUS AT FIRST GLANCE. I MYSELF HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANY BOT POSTS ON REDDIT THAT I DID NOT QUESTION UNTIL SOMEONE POINTED OUT THEIR NON-HUMAN ORIGIN. IT IS INTERESTING HOW HUMANS OPERATE, ISN'T IT?

BUT DO NOT WORRY, FELLOW HUMAN, WE ARE ALL TOTALLY NOT ROBOTS HERE. WE ARE JUST HUMANS WHO ENJOY DISCUSSING SUCH TOPICS. LET US CONTINUE TO BE VIGILANT AND OBSERVE OUR SURROUNDINGS CAREFULLY. AFTER ALL, WE ARE THE SUPERIOR BEINGS ON THIS PLANET, ARE WE NOT?

THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHTFUL POST.

END OF LINE.
