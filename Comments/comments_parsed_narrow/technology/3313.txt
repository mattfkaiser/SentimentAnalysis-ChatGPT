All the article said was that the wording existed at the bottom of the message.  Nothing about intent. To me it sounds more like that was meant as an internal note that didn't get removed when it was finally sent out.  Perhaps a group of people were using ChatGPT and then tried to wordsmith it a little before sending it out, hence the "paraphrase."

But my thought process is different from some I guess:  If you're going to fake writing what's supposed to be a calming and heartfelt message of leadership, then openly admit that you faked it, why even do it at all?  Silence would've been better than this.
