That’s a totally different thing though. 
Wikipedia is an online encyclopaedia. We already had books. It just mad me it easier to access information. 

ChatGPT can write a whole essay for you. Something Wikipedia can’t do. It’s not accessing information anymore but also producing a « well written » output. 

Tbh I’m scared of the impact of this on future generation. Those kind of tools should only be used after you understand logical thinking, argument building, etc.
