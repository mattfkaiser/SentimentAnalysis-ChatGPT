From my experience, it speeds things up, but you need to have deep knowledge of the programming language you're using to be able to use it effectively. ChatGPT is only aware of syntax that it's been trained on (about 20 languages) and that training data is a bit outdated. For at least half the queries I give it, it uses older libraries or deprecated functions and I need to either replace them myself or get even more specific in my queries. It's also only capable of outputting code snippits or smaller functions. 

It can be great for beginners or common code generation, but experienced programmers won't use it for that, they already have their own code and knowledge to get them that far. They're using it for unusual edge cases or new processes and ChatGPT has limited value there.
