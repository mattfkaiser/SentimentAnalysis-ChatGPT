Sure, higher productivity may be the goal but giving people a raise? He might be a unicorn ceo who does that but the historical data shows that the money made by the massive productivity gains made in the past few years went straight into the pockets of the already rich. Barring any serious legislation (never happen with this congress), there’s zero reason to think that this will change.

Edit: the following passage gives an insight into the ceo’s ultimate goals: “Nigam believes that everybody at his company must be committed to using ChatGPT for the company to reap the benefits of reduced workloads and headcount. “

Reduced headcount.   Says it all.
