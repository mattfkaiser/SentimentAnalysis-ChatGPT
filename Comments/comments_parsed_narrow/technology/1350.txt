I mean to be fair people have had that ability for like two decades now. Anytime I think of anything I want to know no matter how trivial it is I pull out my phone and Google it.

The only difference is now I might use chatgpt instead and it might take a little less effort at the cost of potentially getting a wrong answer.

I'm not against chatgpt BTW, I use it a lot and think it can be a great tool to assist in learning and maybe increase productivity by creating boiler code for developers, or to make a framework to start writing an essay or to check for errors in an essay etc.
