As designed, it is very good at filtering through the information it knows and returning an answer that is related to the question. By your comment, I am guessing most of the advice you give comes from existing cases documented well on internet. In such cases, an AI like ChatGPT will always surpass a human because it can process a lot more information. 

The big question is, can it generate new insight combining new data with existing data and expand on the available set of advice. So far that part hasn't been achieved.

I can see this when I ask ChatGPT open ended questions. It gives me a lot of useful information but it really doesn't help much in regards to making an actual decision and weighing those options to each other.
