If you just Copy/Paste it'll take the formatting from the text as well.  (Font, colour, etc)  So you'll end up shooting out a message that conveniently looks like what you'd see in a chat with ChatGPT.  If you copied it into notepad first, all the formatting would be stripped out and you'd only have the text.

Basically ever have that time when you copy/paste into a document but the font is wrong or super large or has extra spacing?  That's what they're talking about.
