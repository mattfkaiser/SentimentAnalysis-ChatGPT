GPT is not only useful for chatbots. 

OpenAI made one named ChatGPT to demonstrate to the general public how good their tech is and also to attract more investors. However, GPT3 can be used for A LOT of things. Since it's extremely good at text, it can be used to categorize (and well) complex text and much MUCH more. I could see this being useful when indexing pages.
