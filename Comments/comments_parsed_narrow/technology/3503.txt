The coming academic year in Australia is going to be fuuuunnnnn.... I just turned down a job teaching a masters topic which would have had me teaching 60+ international students (mostly from south east Asia). I'm still tempted to offer to do the marking for the class just to see how different the 4k and 8k essays are.

Can you used chat gpt to do spell and grammar checks? And sentence structure? Like input your paragraph and ask it to do a spelling and grammar check? Cause if so, holy fuck!
