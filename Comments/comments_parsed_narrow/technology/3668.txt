From the article: 
"In the hiring process, 77% of companies using ChatGPT say they use it to help write job descriptions, 66% to draft interview requisitions, and 65% to respond to applications."

This is an immensely reasonable use of ChatGPT, and represents an efficiency gain over the prior practice of googling for job descriptions to copy and paste.
