I use ChatGPT it for much more mundane tasks like finding synonyms etc. since Google is  nightmare for that. ChatGPT once made up a word, thatâ€™s supposedly a specialist term in a specialist field. Mind you I had worked in said field for more than a decade and I could not find no record of the words in any of my dictionaries and lexicons (yes,I still have those). I asked for sources, it provided sources that sounded legit (well known newspapers, an online dictionary etc) but were completely made up. I could absolutely not get it to admit it was incorrect.
