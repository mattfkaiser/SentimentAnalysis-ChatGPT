TL;DR:  
In summary, ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, has gained attention for its potential therapeutic applications, with some users finding it helpful for cognitive reframing and as a low-stakes, cost-effective alternative to therapy. However, concerns about the quality of the AI's therapeutic support, data privacy issues, and the potential loss of the therapeutic alliance have been raised. Moreover, marginalized communities may be more likely to use ChatGPT for mental health support due to barriers in accessing traditional care, but this may come at the cost of less accountability and quality control. While some see AI chatbots as a valuable supplement to therapy, experts caution against using them as a complete substitute for professional mental health care.
