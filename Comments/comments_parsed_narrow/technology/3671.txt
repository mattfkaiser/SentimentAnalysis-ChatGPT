I can see it being useful for that and it’s definitely a timesaver that way. But you do have to be careful with it because 1) there are other tools that are better for producing “polished” written output for particular audiences, like Grammarly and 2) sometimes people can recognize when a particular piece of writing was produced by ChatGPT and not a human - there will probably be more and more people who can clock this as time goes on, and they may not appreciate it.

Make sure you do some editing on your ChatGPT letters before you send them out, is all I’m saying. It might save you a lot of headaches later.
