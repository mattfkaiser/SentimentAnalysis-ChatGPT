>	He plans to require students to write first drafts in the classroom, using browsers that monitor and restrict computer activity. In later drafts, students have to explain each revision. Mr. Aumann, who may forgo essays in subsequent semesters, also plans to weave ChatGPT into lessons by asking students to evaluate the chatbot’s responses.

All of this sounds like it will foster greater engagement from the students, more discussion and critical thinking, and less busywork all around (writing and formatting for the students, checking font sizes and scanning for plagiarism for the teachers). Win-win!

And acknowledging ChatGPT and using it as a jumping off point for discussion? Superb! Causes students to think more carefully about the material, brings in a relevant subject which may increase their interest (examining the thinking behind the technology), and prevents casting himself as some old-fashioned Luddite who’s trying to stamp out AI. Instead he looks like someone who’s up-to-date and forward-looking. Sure, some students prefer a curriculum that’s completely ossified (that way they can buy a copy of last year’s test to cheat), but I think most are a lot happier and more involved with a class that feels fresh and relevant.
