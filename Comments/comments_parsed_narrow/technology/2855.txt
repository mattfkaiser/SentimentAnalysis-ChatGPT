Same for me. My boring HR employee, manager, and company evaluations will never be the same. Give ChatGPT some basic info on the person/company, some general thoughts I have, and it fills in the rest. It's fantastic!

It also works remarkably well on other things, such as generating company specific cover letters, though in that case based on what I've tested I'd probably do some minor rewrites... 

It even shows promise in something we call "one pagers", which is basically a short one page summary of suggested improvements and their potential impact and risk.
