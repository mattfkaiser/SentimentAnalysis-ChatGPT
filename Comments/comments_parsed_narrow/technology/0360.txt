For everyone commenting, please note that the title is misleading.

The only student actually interviewed about this didn't truly have his essay written by ChatGPT as the headline implies. (See the original [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65167321))

A few things to note:

* The student says: "I didn't copy everything word for word, but I would prompt \[ChatGPT\] with questions that gave me access to information much quicker than usual," said Tom (i.e., the student)
* He also admitted that he would most likely continue to **use ChatGPT** **for the planning and framing of his essays**.
* The article does not state what specific grade he got on the ChatGPT essay, just that it was "the highest mark he has ever had at university."

I'm not saying you can't have the conversation of what happens in the case of this technology becoming more advanced, but having this discussion in context of what actually happened is important.
