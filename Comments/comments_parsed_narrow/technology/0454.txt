ChatGPT writes low quality short paragraph essays without much depth or reasoning. If I trained the AI based on past writing samples THEN I would maybe consider using it but currently the quality is subpar. 

Rather I think that it is a good learning tool to teach you sentence structure, grammar, thesis statements, hook, argument, and conclusion. We should integrate ChatGPT as a TA for English class and use it for other purposes than writing your whole essay.
