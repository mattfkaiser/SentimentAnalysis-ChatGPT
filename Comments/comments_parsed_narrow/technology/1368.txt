This is a really interesting reminder that chatGPT is tool first and foremost. Depending on how good the algorithms can get, this could be used to see how people will most likely react given certain situations. Taken a step further, it can even be used to predict behaviors and reactions of an individual before they happen given a certain dataset on that person. Let’s say Facebook decided to sell its user data on a person to Microsoft and they used that user data to model a specific instance of ChatGPT. Now we can run a simulation of “what would this person most likely do in a situation where x, y, and x happens?” I don’t know that I love the idea of a digital clone of myself, but it would definitely come in handy when I want to have a mid day nap during some teams meetings
