What did it matter what or the way I learned?

You take someone's code, modify it, kept the same algorithm and logic and you think you're magically the author? 
ChatGPT can spit out someone else's code, per the license, it needs to cite the source. Plain and simple.
It doesn't matter that it washed-up unlawfully billion of information. If what it delivers were licensed, it needs to comply like every human being.

You can't claim all over the world that you're the author of something because you refactored two lines.
