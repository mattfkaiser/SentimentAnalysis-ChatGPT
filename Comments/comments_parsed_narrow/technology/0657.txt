Most of the time spent spinning wheels in my experience has nothing to do with the coding though, and everything to do with complications in requirements, technical limitations of platform/technology, a lack of test data that's fully integrated with other systems so the code can be tested properly, among other things.

The coding part isn't often the part that holds you up.

Although I'm sure using ChatGPT can help, there's no way it's saving that much time in the overall development cycle.
