To me, the sentiment was "tough situation is the point, people are meant to struggle and find these situations hard, it's part of the human experience of struggling and suffering and coming together in hard times". 

The sentiment of my response was "I agree. How hard though? Why hard enough that they can't use chatGPT, but not so hard that they don't have to hand write the message?"
