I summarized it in ChatGPT:

The passage highlights the struggle people face in articulating their thoughts and producing elaborate written content. It emphasizes the speed and complexity of AI-generated text, which impresses people who find it difficult to do so themselves. The author suggests that societal factors, such as a focus on efficiency and brevity, have diminished people’s ability to engage in deep thinking and express themselves effectively. The AI’s ability to produce lengthy and thoughtful text stands out in contrast to the perceived limitations of human expression.
