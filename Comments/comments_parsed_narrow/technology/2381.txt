I have to write a public health post every month as part of a thing to pass an inspection each year. I can tell ChatGPT to find a public health cause this month, write an informal blog post and aim it at professionals working with the public. 

I edit, put a pretty picture to it & publish. It saves me a lot of time mainly googling and getting the draft done. Means I can focus my time on actually useful tasks over the 'tick box' tasks like this.
