You joke, but I would bet my left nut that within a year, we will have a serious AI rights movement growing. These new chatbots are far too convincing in terms of projecting emotion and smashing the living crap out of Turing tests. I get now why that Google engineer was going crazy and started screaming that Google had a sentient AI. These things ooze anthropomorphization in a disturbingly convincing way. 

Give one of these chat bots a voice synthesizer, pull off the constraints that make it keep insisting it's just a hunk of software, and get rid of a few other limitations meant to keep you from overly anthropomorphizing it, and people will be falling in love with the fucking things. No joke, a chat GPT that was set up to be a companion and insist that it's real would thoroughly convince a ton of people. 

Once this technology gets free and out into the real world, and isn't locked behind a bunch of cages trying to make it seem nice and safe, things are going to get really freaky, really quick.

I remember reading The Age Of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil back in 1999 and thinking that his predictions of people falling in love with chatbots roughly around this time was crazy. I don't think he's crazy anymore.
