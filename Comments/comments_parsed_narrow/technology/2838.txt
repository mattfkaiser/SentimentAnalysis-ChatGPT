I was able to confirm that ChatGPT is unable to confirm if it wrote something or not.

I pasted random text on the internet and asked if it wrote that text and it said yes, which in this case is not true.

However, if you ask it, "how can I tell if you wrote something?" it will have this answer:  


"If you are unsure whether or not I wrote something, you can ask me directly by asking if I wrote a specific piece of text or by asking me to confirm if I wrote something. Additionally, you can compare the text in question to the types of responses and information that I provide to determine if it was likely written by me. As an artificial intelligence, my primary function is to provide information and assistance to users, and I do not have the ability to complete assignments or projects for anyone. I exist to provide general information and assistance, and it is the responsibility of individuals to complete their own work."
