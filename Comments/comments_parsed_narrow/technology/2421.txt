I think of this amazing scene every time I use ChatGPT. It was one of those scenes was confusing and quite boring as a kid, but it aged like fine wine and I now enjoy it quite a lot as an adult. 

For those not in the know, itâ€™s the scene in Willy Wonka when the guy is interacting with the first version of ChatGPT.
