While Chat GPT maybe very good, more specific domain knowledge is important in many areas. It is expensive and difficult currently to train large models. 

Also Chat GPT is just an LLM, more specialized algorithms maybe better suited to different industries. Just go on youtube and people are using Chat GPT for a range of uses which it has no purpose for. 

An example of this is I saw a video about using Chat GPT for a trading bot. The model is not designed for that at all and really does not fit that use case.

There are also other reasons behind this as well, one of them being business related. You cannot train Chat GPT on screening for Breast Cancer for example, I am not saying GPT cannot be engineered to do it, but rather access to the data is restricted by gatekeepers who will build their own tools.

So to answer this question, in some ways yes. Specialized information may need to be represented or used differently. 

But you have missed something, these branching off of Google is not specialized knowledge they would be search algorithms. There is a difference between search and the compiled responses. For example if I search "how do I get out of a parking ticket", Google returns a bunch of results it gives you a set of information which you can decipher. The weight of the information returned is based on Googles algorithm. 

AI on the other handle takes information and compiles a response. 

The difference is similar to asking the yellow pages for legal advice and asking a lawyer (AI heading towards this) for legal advice. Google is just a fancier yellow pages.
