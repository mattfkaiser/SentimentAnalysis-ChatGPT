"The lawyer even provided screenshots to the judge of his interactions with ChatGPT, asking the AI chatbot if one of the cases were real. ChatGPT responded that it was. It even confirmed that the cases could be found in "reputable legal databases." Again, none of them could be found because the cases were all created by the chatbot."

It seems to be great at telling people what they want to hear.
