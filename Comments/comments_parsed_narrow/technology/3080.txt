Here is the curriculum map we are using to create a bleeding edge course for our students. This is a code red we are trying to harness, not stifle. There is no putting this genie back in the web-bottle.

It is important to note that this is just an early draft, and the specific content and format of the course will depend on our schools instructor's expertise(using chatgpt to supercharge them;).
