I can explain this experience, if you were to google “is ketchup bad for health” you will be fed thousand of articles and resources citing the “badness” of ketchup. Alternatively if you google “is ketchup healthy” you will find thousands of resources citing how healthy ketchup is. ChatGPT is not actual AI and it cannot provide you a summary reply as to weather ketchup is good or bad for your health and it must be told by the end user which side of this truth to be on. Ultimately, Ketchup is healthy for certain people and unhealthy for others dependent on the quantity consumed over a given period of time. You have been providing a guideline formula to work on when there are innumerable formulas that say one thing vs the other. They are just formula’s. Every time you close the chat you are starting a new session and it requires the formula prompt again.
