If you don’t know how to write an essay, you won’t know how to modify your ChatGPT/AI paper to make it sound even remotely interesting.

It’s just gonna raise the bar in a different way. Essays are simply meant to see if you know anything about a subject and can coherently put your opinion to paper. If you don’t, AI won’t help you stand out.
