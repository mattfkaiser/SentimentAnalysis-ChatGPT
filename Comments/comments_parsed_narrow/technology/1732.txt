Integration with Wolfram Alpha would not have fixed the mistake ChatGPT made in the oscillator problem or the hermitian operator problem.  It said that pendulum kinetic energy peaks at when amplitudes are at their greatest, which violates physical intuition (or at least my physical intuition).  So, in spite of its impressive performance, it still lacks "common sense", which Wolfram Alpha cannot supply. [Cyc, on the other hand...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc)
