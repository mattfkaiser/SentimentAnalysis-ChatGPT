Agreed. I'm a big fan of Copilot, another OpenAi product. And I mostly use that for line completion. Overall I think it helps me code 20-50% faster. I would struggle to use ChatGPT3 as effectively. I have seen some very good uses of ChatGPT3 for development. For example I've seen it try to convert a bash script to python. That's very cool, but how often am I actually going to use that in practice? Rarely. My work is across hundreds of files and a bug can be spread out through the logic across multiple projects/services. Copilot already speeds up my work using the same technology.
