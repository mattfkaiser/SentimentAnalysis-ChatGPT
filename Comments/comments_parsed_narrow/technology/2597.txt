There is a risk that ChatGPT or any other AI language model could be used for astroturfing, which is the practice of disguising sponsored messages as genuine, independent content. The ease of generating large amounts of coherent text makes these models vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors. It is important for organizations and individuals using these models to be transparent about their use and to have ethical guidelines in place to prevent astroturfing or any other malicious use.
