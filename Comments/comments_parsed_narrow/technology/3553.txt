First recipe I asked from chatgpt (vegan sinegang) it got caught in some kind of loop and ended up instructing me to put like 40 cups of beans in the soup. Sinegang doesn't even have beans in it!

But I know what you're all wondering. What's the recipe! Here it is, just in case you want to try it. Just one suggestion: you may need to add a little more water.

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 thumb sized piece of ginger
1 large tomato, diced
1 cup water
1 cup Vegetable broth
2 tablespoons Tamarind concentrate
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 cup uncooked brown rice
I cup uncooked black rice
1 cup uncooked quinoa
1 cup uncooked Farro
2 cups uncooked lentils
4 cups uncooked mung beans
4 cups uncooked chickpeas
4 cups uncooked kidney beans
4 cups uncooked black beans
4 cups uncooked pinto beans
4 cups uncooked lima beans
4 cups uncooked navy beans
4 cups uncooked Fava beans
4 cups uncooked adzuki beans
4 cups uncooked black eyed peas
