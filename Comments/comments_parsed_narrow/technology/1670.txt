open ai's "ethicists" have set the bot up to support their own personal moral, ethical, and political prerogaitves

not to be glib but like, that's what's going on, and let me suggest: that's bad

it's also annoying because chatgpt is practically incapable of being funny or interesting

the best racist joke it could come up with is:

"why did the white man cross the road - to avoid the minorities on the other side" which like, is actually a little funny

and if you try to get it to suggest why ai ethicists are dumb, or argue in favor of the proposition "applied ethics is just politics" it ties itself into knots
