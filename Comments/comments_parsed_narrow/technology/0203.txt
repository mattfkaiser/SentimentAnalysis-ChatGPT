While the comments here point out the obvious hipocracy, the way in which the EU wants to impose regulation is not really the same thing request by all the people involved in the ai industry have pointed out the need for. The regulations would impose barriers to apply the tech properly. I think if these regulations go through and the EU were to successfully apply those to chatgpt and others the product would be not worth using. This is a very complex line they need to draw and current laws cannot properly add good regulations to these systems.
