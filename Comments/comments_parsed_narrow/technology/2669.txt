I’m a data science and artificial intelligence major and recently just wrote a research proposal on how chat GPT compares to human participants in the context of mathematical word problems solving. The full scale experiment hasn’t yet been carried out, but I can tell you from a few samples chatGPT still does not have good interpretation skills yet. It can be helpful and will likely get more helpful as time goes on, but right now it’s not in the process of taking your job.
