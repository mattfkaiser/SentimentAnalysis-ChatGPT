Having taken college writing courses, I'm not sure we do that today.

Go take English 112, turn in a research paper, how will the teacher grade it?  Does the teacher check your sources to see if they're good and credible, that you drew valid and cogent information from them that supports your thesis statement?

No of course not; they're English teachers.  You get graded on spelling, punctuation, phraseology, and rigid adherence to arbitrary formatting rules such as the MLA.  The sumtotal of my English teachers cared a lot more about indentations, margins and number of sentences in a paragraph than factual correctness or logical validity.

Which do you think would be the more valuable assignment?

1. Okay class, pick up your meal kits and head to the library.  We're locking you in for the next 100 hours with the power shut off.  Write a 5-page essay on your topic of choice citing sources ONLY FROM THESE BOOKS, NO ELECTRONICS.  At least 8 sentences per paragraph, 12 point double spaced.  Your families will be waiting to see you on Friday.
2. Okay class, have ChatGPT generate a 5 page essay on your topic of choice, and then tell me if it's bullshit or not.  Prepare a packet including links to, or copies of, the sources it cites.  Append your own notes discussing each source's credibility and validity.  Does the source actually exist?  Is it peer reviewed and published in a reputable journal?  Is it current or obsolete?  Does the source actually say what ChatGPT says it does?  Does the research support ChatGPT's thesis?

I think option 2 is a much more valuable exercise for life in the 21st century.
