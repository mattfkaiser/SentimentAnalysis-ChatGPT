“ChatGPT, make a Java function that returns the value of a circle’s area given the diameter as input”;  
ChatGPT generate the right code;  
“Holy shit ChatGPT is gonna kill the IT industry”  
Seriously I had this conversation too many times in 6 month, I’m tired boss.  
Meanwhile I’m in pause scratching my heads for 5 days now wondering how the fuck I can fix my non working API in a 20k lines of code project, people don’t understand that dev as a job is not “writing a function” or “write a flappy bird like game”, it’s literally managing dependencies and testing all that shit.  
AI is really far far far off from kicking devs, and imho it’s not even that helpful compared to Google; especially when every IT company asks you to look out for documentation unless they’re really really bad at this job (no one likes copy&pasted code, be it Google’d or made by AI).
