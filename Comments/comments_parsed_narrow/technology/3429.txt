>For ChatGPT to replace my job

from what I have heard from my sister (who does computer programming and uses chatgpt a lot), it is no where near the level of being able to make programmers obsolete. However, it is pretty good at writing code and can make programming much more efficient (aka make it so less people and time are needed to do a job, so there will be less demand for (particularly lower level) programmers).
