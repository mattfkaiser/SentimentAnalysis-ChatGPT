Here is the latest update: https://kpel965.com/texas-am-commerce-professor-fails-entire-class-chat-gpt-ai-cheat/ 


"In a meeting with the Prof, and several administrative officials we learned several key points.

It was initially thought the entire class’s diplomas were on hold but it was actually a little over half of the class

The diplomas are in “hold” status until an “investigation into each individual is completed”

The school stated they weren’t barring anyone from graduating/ leaving school because the diplomas are in hold and not yet formally denied.

I have spoken to several students so far and as of the writing of this comment, 1 student has been exonerated through the use of timestamps in google docs and while their diploma is not released yet it should be.

Admin staff also stated that at least 2 students came forward and admitted to using chat gpt during the semester. This no doubt greatly complicates the situation for those who did not.

In other news, the university is well aware of this reddit post, and I believe this is the reason the university has started actively trying to exonerate people. That said, thanks to all who offered feedback and great thanks to the media companies who reached out to them with questions, this no doubt, forced their hands.

Allegedly several people have sent the professor threatening emails, and I have to be the first to say, that is not cool. I greatly thank people for the support but that is not what this is about."
