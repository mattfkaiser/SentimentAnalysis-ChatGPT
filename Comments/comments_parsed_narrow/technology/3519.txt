I use chat GpT all the time for school. 

It’s great to summarize articles so I am not wasting my time reading through articles that may not even be helpful to my work. 

When I do find articles that will contribute, I will use the information obtained by the summary to write into my paper. 

I also use Grammarly which will sometimes completely re-write sentences, so is that cheating too? 

I think copying word for word is bad, however most students will re-write into their own words. Majority of essays and research papers are your one work. You are reading other peoples work and using that to write your papers. 

Chat GPT just helps that process go a little faster. 

I think chatGPT is an amazing tool

I am also learning coding, I took a C++ a few semesters ago and while working on code I would often run into issues. I would then go into forums and ask for help. Most of the time the suggestions people made did not help! It would be so frustrating.

Now I’m learning a different computer language, when I write my program and it’s not working and I can not figure out why, I copy and paste into ChatGPT and say what’s wrong with this code and not only will it tell me how to fix it but it goes I to depth about why it didn’t work and how the fix will make it work. 

ChatGPT has accelerated my learning immensely this semester. Some topics are a little over my head and I ask ChatGPT to explain a topic to me like I’m a kindergartner and it does splendidly. 

I feel like educators get so scared whenever we progress in learning.

When Wikipedia first came out, educators were panicked forbidding any students from using it in any capacity for school. 

Now it’s seen as a reliable source for many HS and college assignments. 

Instead of demonizing this amazing technology educators need to figure out how to implement it into everyday learning. 

My knowledge and understanding on many topics has grown exponentially since using ChatGPT, it is an invaluable resource for education!
