If I hear AI referred to as “cheating” or “plagarism” 90% of the time it’s rooted in ignorance of AI and 9% it’s stupidity and 1% of the time it’s legitimate.

There is a place to learn how to write independently of an AI but if you are writing essays or research papers or business communications or copywriting you are fucking up SEVERELY to an extent people probably don’t comprehend.  You know who some of the earliest adopters of chatgpt are?  Prolific writers, because they write all the time, they intuitively know how to take advantage of the tool, they know how much time it can save them, and they are humble enough to admit that sometimes the AI can even out-write them.

Teaching kids to write without AI means not teaching them modern writing skills that people who write to earn a living use every day.
