Let me save everyone a click:

>Akash Nigam, the founder of Genies — the $1 billion avatar startup used by celebrities like Justin Bieber and Cardi B — is spending $2,400 a month on ChatGPT Plus accounts  
 for all of his 120 employees as part of an experiment to boost   
productivity and save money. Insider verified the purchase of the   
accounts with a receipt.

So basically it's a company that's floating around trying to suck up venture capital money until it either goes bust or gets bought out for more than it's worth.  It's not a real company.
