Author here: I'm holding out hope, honestly.

By definition, machines are primarily good and useful for consistency, and quantity. ChatGpt might know how to write a book, but the inevitability is that most of the books it will write will all be the same, at their core. Same grammar, same prose, same too-perfect-product. It'll read like a mile away to any diligent readers that 'this was made by a machine', like a non-native speaker using Google Translate.

People don't want perfect, and they don't truly want more of the same material. When someone says "I want more of this", they refer to wanting more of the passion, more of the quality, more of the prose and intricacies of that particular author. They want little imperfections, little plot holes and perhaps missteps. It makes the book human, and it makes the art unique.

So I think ChatGPT might be a tool in the future, perhaps a blurb writer or a tool to throw ideas around, but it cannot replace human creativity.

It's a bit like the camera when it first came around, for artists. It didn't replace, but it worked alongside the existing art. Same for the computer.

At worst... I think we're about to see a flood of crap on the markets, either entirely written by ChatGPT, or untrained authors looking for quick cash. It'll probably turn a lot of readers away, maybe we'll start to see a whole wall of "AI literature", like the romance or thriller section at the bookstore. But it's the same it's always beenâ”€gotta dig through shit to find the gold.

Maybe I'm just huffing copium, though.
