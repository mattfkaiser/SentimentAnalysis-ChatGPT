>excited Redditor with a theory, do you understand how ChatGPT works?

CS degree and a few years working with various types of machine learning.

 it's "just" predicting the next word with some fine tuning layered on top of that.

But it turns out that forces it to learn to reason a little about what it's predicting.

It "only" has the reasoning ability of a child. (Chatgpt 3.5 is somewhere around the level of a 7 year old child while the version based on gpt4 is better)

But even the people who built it don't fully understand how it can reason at all.
