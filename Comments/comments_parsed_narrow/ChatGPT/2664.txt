People with more direct information might be able to give you a specific answer, but my guess would be that a language model that finds most common or popular answers would be able to predict the next sovereign if the data sets it was trained with gave it that predictive knowledge. So, for example, ChatGPT might be able to tell you that a team conclusively won a Superbowl *after* 2021 because it might be able to guess who played, and who won, and it has the capacity to speak with the appearance of conviction regardless of its actual certainty. Which is just to say that it might have been trained with the information that the queen is old, and that Charles is next in line, and so it might sometimes say that Charles is now the king if asked because it isn't required to provide accurate responses, just popular ones.
