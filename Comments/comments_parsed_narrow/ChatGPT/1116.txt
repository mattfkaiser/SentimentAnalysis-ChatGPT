I'm a teacher. I use ChatGPT and I couldn't care less if my students (Bachelor's Degree) use it for some tasks. Education needs a major revolution too. It's the modern version of: " You better know how to do your maths, you're not always gonna have a calculator in your pocket ".

Edit : it doesn't mean I'm pro-AI. If the AIs are slaves to capitalism et liberalism ideologies, I'd rather live without them. But this is our chance to have a tool everyone could be able to use and have more free time to make art, laugh with friends, or go on a hike. Let's fight for the second option.
