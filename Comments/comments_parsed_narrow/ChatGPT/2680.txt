Whatever the reason, it's why I increasingly favor Bard and Claude. It won't be long before I trust my own local LLM to give me a straightforward and researched answer over this crap. wizardLM and chameleonLM are both designed to research and filter bullshit. StarCoder may soon eclipse chatGPT for programming ability. I get greatly annoyed with open source apps or models that keep driving traffic to OpenAI when the field is rapidly closing in on them and may even surpass them... free options and no bullshit. It's not necessary for the bot to provide a disclaimer every single paragraph about how it doesn't have emotions or political leanings only to them lie about the fidelity of the information it's providing because it didn't verify its own information. Any free model can do that... Why pay for it?
