Chat GPT correctly diagnosed me of something my primary care Dr got wrong! I was covered in weird spots on my toros which hurt. She was sure it was the chicken pox (which I highly doubted as the spots didn’t itch, and I’ve had it before).
Put my symptoms into ChatGPT and it said folliculitis.
Turns out it was hot tub folliculitis as I had been in a hot tub 4 days before. Wasn’t pleasant. All my individual hair follicles were infected from some bacteria found in hot tubs. Perhaps useful for a second opinion?!
