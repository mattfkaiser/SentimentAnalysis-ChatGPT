I don't think it can replace a good therapist, but it can replace the mediocre ones. (I have had bad experiences with some of the online therapy services for example. ChatGPT has been better than those plus it is free)

It can also be a good supplement to therapy. You could use it like an interactive intelligent journaling tool to reflect on certain things where you know your logic is failing you, and you are perhaps getting into a dark loop in your head.

Of course my hope for humanity as a whole is that we have more of quality therapists easily available as a part of usual health insurance plans all over the world. But we are not there yet, and it seems that people are struggling with more and more mental, emotional issues. So the more resources we can have to help us get through these, the better.
