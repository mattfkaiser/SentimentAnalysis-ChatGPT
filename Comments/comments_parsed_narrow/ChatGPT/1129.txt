>But if the day I accuse you, you plop down a pile of well researched and thoughtful defense of a program a lot of students don’t fully understand or use yet, that well crafted defense is going to prove to those types of teachers that you were prepared because you’re heavily using it.

Honestly, this makes me so mad. A lot of us are technology aware, do not use technology to cheat, and are paranoid enough to gather evidence in case of needing to defend our work. I'm so glad that I got through all my college English classes just before chatGPT became a thing, because I definitely fall into the category I just explained.
