The solution for students cheating via ChatGPT is also solved via ChatGPT. 

For each paper submitted, use ChatGPT or similar to generate a custom quiz/test based specifically on the submitted paper. Students would then have to complete the quiz on their own paper, in class. This will ensure that the students 100% have knowledge about the provided work they have submitted. 

Papers can be graded on the students actual grasp of the knowledge they have submitted. Possibly for example, lets say  the paper submitted has a serious mistake.. in the quiz, the student must answer as their paper stated, although incorrect. This will ensure at the very least students are 100% aware of what they submit as opposed to blind generation and submission of papers.
