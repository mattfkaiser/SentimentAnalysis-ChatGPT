GitHub copilot ( Microsoft) is big chatGPT investor so that’s the best way to utilize chatGPT for writing code I believe because it’s integrated and besides I don’t think they want to even try to advance AI’s code architecting ability to the point that it can write its own executables. I didn’t play around with the prompts a whole lot but I believe you could get ChatGPT to write you the code for a tic-tac-toe game in python but even still you would have to write the code to make it an executable app. I can see it being able to do very small scale things like that for teaching purposes but it’s not intended for writing an entire application.
