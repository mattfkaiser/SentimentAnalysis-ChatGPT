I have severe anxiety, so I had difficulties talking to anyone really, so I missed out on asking teachers to explain certain subjects that I didn’t understand because I guess I was too scared. Googling stuff helps but it’s a hassle and sometimes it’s never explained simpler. So chatGPT has been filling up certain gaps in knowledge that I had without feeling judged and having the ability to tell it to explain it in simple terms helps a whole lot.
