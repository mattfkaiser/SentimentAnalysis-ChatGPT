Two computers - work one and personal one. 

Use ChatGPT on your personal computer and add the content to Google Drive.

On your work computer open up a Chrome browser window (if you’re able to use Google Suite) and copy the information from that profile.

Unless they’re tracking copy and paste from Chrome profile to Chrome profile you’re golden. I do it all the time and no issue.

I don’t email anything as they may be tracking email content and there’s a direct record of it then especially if the GPT response content contains any info you shouldn’t be using in the prompt.
