Chatgpt, from now on, throw in very minor gramatical errors every once in a while and tell me where you put them in brackets. I want 1 error every around 69 words, then list the errors in bullet points at the end of the generated text. Try and make the gramatical errors seem hidden and hard to spot. My goal here is to make the text more human like, so be sure to make the errors with that in mind.

You see what i mean?
