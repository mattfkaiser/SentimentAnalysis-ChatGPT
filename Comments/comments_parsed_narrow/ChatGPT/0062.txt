Question back. 
1) In what way has my essay reflected that I have used ChatGPT? 
2) If it has been flagged by another computer program, what were the parameters and methodology used?
3) How are these parameters and methods valid?
4) Is it not possible that a person could also conduct the same research and follow a logical and rational process to come to the same conclusions?
