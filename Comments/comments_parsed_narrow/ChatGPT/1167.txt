I am a social worker. What am I supposed to use it for? It is too bad too look up law stuff. It cannot talk with my clients. It can make the documentation faster but basically not really considering I don't write proper sentences anyway so the stuff I give ChatGPT is the same as what I would write. Soo... I can use it for mails. And I don't write enough long mails for that to be useful
