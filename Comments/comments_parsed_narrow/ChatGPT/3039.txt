But your company is paying a team of people to develop something worse than ChatGPT. If your team has 10 people making $100,000 a year... that's $1,000,000 a year compared to a $20 per month subscription to ChatGPT. And yes, while ChatGPT does have its limitations, those limitations will probably be gone soon. I can see why they wouldn't want to continue paying your team when they can just use ChatGPT and other services that have already been developed or that will be available in the near future.
