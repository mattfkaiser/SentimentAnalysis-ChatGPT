I don't think IT will make a big deal of using ChatGPT, but I wouldn't copy anything with PHI if you work in healthcare.   Code snippets should be okay, but I wouldn't use full files, or you cross more into intellectual property.

I use Bard at work, and as long as the materials aren't hypersensitive, I think I'm okay to proceed.  I wouldn't copy and paste an unread email though, or materials that could risk exposure online somehow.

To sum up, if your intentions are good and you're not being sloppy about it, you should be ok.
