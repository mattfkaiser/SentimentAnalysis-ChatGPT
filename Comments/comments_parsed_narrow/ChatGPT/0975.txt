Congrats on getting AI to produce something that works in a practical sense!  It's not easy to do that.

Could you share how you did it?  I'd be interested to know what kind of prompts you used.

I've been struggling to get ChatGPT to generate code that doesn't require a lot of fixes.  I think it saves me time more often than it wastes my time, but it'd be helpful to see an example of how to use it properly.
