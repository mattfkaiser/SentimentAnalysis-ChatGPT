Said the person with western ideology that being able to make jokes on anything is power. In our culture, certain things can't be joked about, it's just disrespectful. I think it's pretty interesting ChatGPT got that vibe, since there is no "light-hearted" joke you can make about Allah, IMO. In fact, islamic faith prohibits jokes on any religion, despite many muslims doing so.
