I think the best use of ChatGPT is to give it a draft of your original content and have it edit for structure/tone.

You can also put in sections of work and ask if itâ€™s clear. It will tell you yes/no  and why.

A pretty nice way to learn writing skills and make editing and coaching more accessible.
