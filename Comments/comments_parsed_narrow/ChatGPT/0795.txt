I agree in this case, though I can imagine in many cases aroudn the world ChatGPT will push some people over the edge of going to the hospital. Think of it like this:

\- Something really bad happens with your body: You go to the hospital

\- Something strange but seemingly harmless happens with your body: You contemplate and may or may not go

\- Nothing happen with your body: You don't go o the hospital

Case 1 is clear. Case 3 is clear. But in-between the two, there's a gradient... and in that gradient, ease of information can matter.
