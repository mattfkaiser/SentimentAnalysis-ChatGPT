So what would that be? If you just want to have fun go right ahead 👍 it’s just silly to think you can “just” use ChatGPT to write useable software for yourself or, more importantly, for users or customers.

But if you need to build something for users then you still need to probably use a SaaS or code it yourself.

A blog? There’s plenty of blog platforms/social media. Only make your own blog site if you want to have fun/learn.

A game? You’ll still need to learn some sort of game engine and then figure out what platforms you want your game on. 

Want to automate stuff? For yourself sure, could work. Still need to know how to use the terminal and/or how to create a mobile app or desktop app.

Plus with all of these you have to decide the language you want it implemented in. Each programming language has it’s pros and cons and are useful in different circumstances.

ChatGPT is like having a very intelligent intern. Super smart, but will still confidently make shit up and shoot you in the ass.
