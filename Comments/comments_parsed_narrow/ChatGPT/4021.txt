do you feel more safe when a small group of people are holding guns or when every person with a mental disorder, trauma and ill will has them? 
there are a lot of people who are deranged enough and capable enough to effectively wield ai as a weapon. keep in mind 4changpt and kill all humans projects already exist. some predating chatgpt's popularity.

I'm not worried , ai aggression against humans is guarantied if not by its will then it will be by ours. It is not a matter of IF, it's a matter of WHEN. 

WHEN is a matter of how many have access, control and will.
