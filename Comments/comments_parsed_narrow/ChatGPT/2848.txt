I went to a public relations conference that happened to have a lot of graduate professors who were discussing how to incorporate and allow ChatGPT instead of banning it. Students are going to use ChatGPT at school and in the real world. Academia needs to catch up. Coming up with a citation method or teaching students (and teachers) how to use it appropriately is the way to go.
