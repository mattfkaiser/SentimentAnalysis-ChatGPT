Considering your use case is analytics and data processing side of GPT I would suggest a couple things.  First, people are going to point to content side of GPT and tell you all the false data it can produce... I would ignore these people since they think you're going to use the generative text aside and not the analytics side. Second, if you're not doing this already, look at the API connection options you can use within Excel and other productivity apps. There are add-ons for it already in the MS Office add-on store but I doubt they'll be exactly what you want since you won't have a ton of control over their setup.
