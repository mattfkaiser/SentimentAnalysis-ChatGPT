I think this is actually quite true. It’s not to say ChatGPT is bad or doesn’t perform well. It just takes more than typing text to create a good prompt if you need an output with any nuance or specific details. That’s not going to attract everybody. 

There’s also likely a creativity/tech-savvy component that might be missing in some people (or at least, ChatGPT isn’t stimulating creativity in everyone equally). If you can’t imagine what you would use ChatGPT for (beyond a search engine), it’s probably just not aligned to what makes you creative. 

By “you,” I mean “someone” and not you, specifically. 

A few personal examples:

I showed it to my sister and she didn’t get it—except the negatives. She immediately was like, “it made a mistake. It is obviously not ready because it isn’t perfect.” 

I use it for work constantly and rolled it out to me team. It’s interesting to see their usage. I’d sAy that maybe 25% of us have integrated it into our daily work routines, and another 25% might use it occasionally for specific use cases. The rest don’t use it or see the value—even with several “show and tell” sessions and prompt training, dedicated professional development time to learn to use it, etc. 

It will be interesting to see how this all develops.
