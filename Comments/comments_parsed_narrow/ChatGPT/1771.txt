Yep, thats how I use chat GPT. There’s no way in hell I would ever ask it to write an entire piece on its own and all I did was provide the prompt. But I think it’s a useful tool to provide corrections/proofreading, such as fixing your grammar. I see nothing wrong with writing the first draft of an essay yourself, and then asking it to give you its corrections.
