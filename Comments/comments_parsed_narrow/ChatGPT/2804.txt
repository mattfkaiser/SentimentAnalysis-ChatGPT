Let's do it. Here's a game they can play with ChatGPT on Creative Mode to figure out why it's dumb to argue with people over words when the intention, the telepathic underlay (if we could experience it), is what's important:

"[A] [FIX] [A] [TION] ‚Ä¢ Prefix, Root Word, Infix, Suffix: the four card pits to draw from in the game to help you rule the words that ruled you.

‚Ä¢Draw one of each card per player until no Infixes remain.
‚Ä¢You need to use at least one Prefix card OR one Suffix card per turn, OR you can use one of each.
‚Ä¢You can choose to fill in a blank Root Word card for any turn if you've thought of one you like more than any you drew.
‚Ä¢You don't have to use an Infix card, OR you can use more than one.

The goal is to make up a word and use it in a sentence, then the other players try and guess what the word means based on connotations and inferences.

There's no official point system yet, but the more imaginative or funny sentences usually get the most credit from other players. Try to make up new words, or use existing words in new and creative ways.

If you want to play, will you go first, please?"
