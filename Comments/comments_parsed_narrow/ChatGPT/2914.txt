I’m sure they asked ChatGPT how to stop someone from attacking their system.

I want to /s, because my point is “lol bet they did”, but I also know someone, has asked ChatGPT this exact thing. Either to verify it can know the answer, or help set up more secure system, or someone genuinely asking for help.

We are so close to AI asking AI for help building the next AI, and I’m both elated and terrified of the future.
