Earlier this week I asked ChatGPT where the house featured in "Ring of Brightwater" was located.

1st response;

*The house featured in the book "Ring of Brightwater" by Gavin Maxwell is  located in the coastal village of Sandaig, on the west coast of  Scotland. Sandaig is situated in the region of West Highlands, near the  Isle of Skye.*

Prompted for a 2nd response;

*I apologize for any confusion caused. The actual house featured in "Ring  of Brightwater" and where Gavin Maxwell lived is not located in  Sandaig, as depicted in the book. In reality, the house known as  Camusfearna, where Maxwell kept his otters, was situated near the  village of Glenelg in the West Highlands of Scotland. Glenelg is located  on the mainland, not far from the Isle of Skye.*

Prompted for a 3rd response;

*I apologize for the confusion caused by the conflicting information. The  correct location of the house known as Camusfearna, where Gavin Maxwell  lived and kept his otters, is in Sandaig, not Glenelg. Sandaig is a  village located on the west coast of Scotland, near the Isle of Skye, in  the area known as Moidart.*

If this is our future god help us!
