I had a similar answer. It’s not included in the poll but I think AI and tools like ChatGPT have the ability to help humans see certain things from a new and different perspective, find answers that maybe no one else could discover on their own. This would likely lead to continued advancement but likely different advancements. 

Jokingly, I’m still a bit hung up on how it could invent things necessary for its existence such as electricity. Reminds me a bit of the chicken and egg scenario. My practical brain says this isn’t even possible and my creative brain thinks a gifted orb of AI or even AGI capable of listening and responding to humans back in that time, provided by some advanced foreign life form would undoubtedly reshape the world we are a part of currently. If some orb of AGI showed up randomly today, I bet human life would look different going forward than if we didn’t have access to that orb.
