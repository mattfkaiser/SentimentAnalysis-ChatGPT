Arguably one of the Wizard models. Most recently, we got something called Manticore-13B which is an update on WizardMEGA. It has been surprisingly good. There's a lot of interest in WizardLM-30B-Uncensored, which seems to be a bit better, but I can't run it locally so I use Vast.ai. It's pretty cheap once you figure it out, cheaper than ChatGPT if you really try, just not as convenient.
