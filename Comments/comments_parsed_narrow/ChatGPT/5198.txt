>How does it know that it wrote it?

It doesn't know **ANYTHING**. It **CAN'T** know **ANYTHING**. Literally. This is why I keep telling people to stop anthropomorphizing ChatGPT.

ChatGPT **CAN'T** be happy, sad, biased, angry, hopeful, understanding, knowing, lying, telling the truth, etc... Anyone who uses such words when referring to ChatGPT is, at best, an ignorant moron (I'm referring to the professor, not you).
