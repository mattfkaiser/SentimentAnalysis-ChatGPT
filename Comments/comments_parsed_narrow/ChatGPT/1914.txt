At the moment it feels like ChatGPT is going to nail that "It's not just good...it's good enough" segment. Like if I want to know why my grill's chimney starter is smoking too much, ChatGPT can give me a list of things to check, one or two of which might not be quite right, while Google is serving me results for the best chimney starters to buy and the least smokey charcoal to buy.

It's important to understand, though, these things aren't mutually exclusive. We're not far from ChatGPT results like "The most common reason for too much smoke in a chimney starter is using charcoal briquettes. You should use lump wood charcoal instead, such as X Brand. X Brand lump wood charcoal is in stock at Y Store in your town. Would you like me to use the credit card on file to have them set a bag aside for pickup? Delivery is also an option for an extra $3.99."
