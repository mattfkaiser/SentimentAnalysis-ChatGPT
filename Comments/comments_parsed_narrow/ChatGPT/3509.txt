ChatGPT just built an app that I have been wanting for ever, but didn't know any programming. It's a daily routine app, more like life organizer app. 

Outlook, To do lists apps, and many other may have the same features but not in a way that I wanted. I customized it the way I wanted, so it might not be shareable. It lets me organize my daily routine, create reminders, notes, right now I am trying to sync everything to phone using various techniques. And I have gotten to pretty advanced level in Python.

Irony is, it was supposed to make me productive and make me manage my time efficiently, manage my adhd, and everthing. But now I pull all nighters just to find the perfect colors for the reminder widgets. It's taken my entire mental bandwidth and the original goal is no longer valid. I am obsessed. This is not the first time. 2 years ago, I did the same thing with "FocusMe" app. I might need help. I don't know where I am going with this.
