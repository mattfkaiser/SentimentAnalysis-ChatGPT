Use case studies and require students to analyze what is actually going on (think law school exams). Or for homework just have students get the results but also have them explain how they derived those results or only rely on work done at home for learning and the grade comes from an in class test where computers aren't available.

Don't just have students read a book and summarize it. Chatgpt can do that of course and you know that they have had it do that so delve into details for the test that meant that they actually had to read it.

That's always been an issue with Cliff Notes and that's how you get around that. In law school there are summaries for every course that no one is supposed to buy, that everyone does buy and that are sold in the student bookstore. They help for learning if you don't use them as a crutch. If you do, you won't pass the case study analyses during the in class final exams.

The professors just have to get creative and ultimately if the student can't pass an oral exam in front of a professor, they fail.  


You could require that they use Chatgpt to summarize dozens of books, instead of just one, and you just up the workload. Chatgpt is actually a good tool so structure the coarse around the need to use it as such.
