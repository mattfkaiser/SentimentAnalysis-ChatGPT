I feel you. The very first 'therapist' I saw was a psychiatrist who spoke in cliches and her solution to everything was medication. I can totally see her getting replaced by ChatGPT.

 Needless to say I found a better therapist with whom I have been with for almost 5 years. It's hard to find another human with her talent let alone an AI language model.
