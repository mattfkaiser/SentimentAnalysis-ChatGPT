*You* aren't impressed with it. I'm not either - it only moderately amuses me.

However, some people *do seem to be impressed,* and **you are not in charge of what other people are impressed by.** If people want "mildly clever", second-lowest-common-denominator content, by gawd they'll get it.

People read and watch third-rate, derivative garbage **all the time**. Who are you to say that's "not marketable"? Okay that was more full-on than I intended, but the point stands - why can't some random douchebag write sitcom scripts scene by scene, episode by episode with the help of ChatGPT?

I get that we're here to hear *controversial opinions* \- I upvoted you based on that fact - but it also helps to hear and understand why ChatGPT would not be good at one of the only things it's actually kinda good at doing - spitting out pithy content like a factory assembly line.
