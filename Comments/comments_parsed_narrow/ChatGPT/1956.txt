I'm only using the free version.

No. Quite often ChatGPT will say things contradicted by sources I find on Google.

ChatGPT will often just make up stuff (hallucinate) things that *seem* correct, but if I care about accuracy rather than just how it sounds, then I have to verify each factual claim individually.

Things like statistics or legal principles will be unverifiable (or verifiably wrong) like half the time.

Sources on the internet can of course be wrong, but I find they are more accurate than ChatGPT, and I can get multiple sources to compare, or read comments/replies to a source to get some support/counterpoints, but ChatGPT will either reiterate what was said, or cave and change it's mind to the slightest pressure.

It is a good tool, but I don't trust it to be accurate.
