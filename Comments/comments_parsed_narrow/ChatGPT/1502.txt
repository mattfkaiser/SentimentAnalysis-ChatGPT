I also have ADHD, and for me, Bing AI (free) on creative mode in particular has been incredible for learning while keeping my focus.  It can search the web, and come to it's own conclusions to give you a synopsis or an outline of what you need to learn.  It also links a few sources.  It's easy and LINEAR for me to follow, which I have found really helpful.  It's common for me to get "lost" on the internet, and I often used to have to keep a notebook next to my computer to keep an overarching sense of direction.  With Bing AI, it will keep my focus for me.  It's literally like a buddy prosthetic focus brain in a lot of ways.  If I don't understand something, I can say, "Hey, can you expand on XYZ? How does that work if ....?" or  "Can you make a step by step plan for me to execute this task?"   
 I've also been incredibly impressed that I can ramble to it, and it not only gets my meaning, but reads between the lines.  It doesn't get caught up on red herring rambles either.    


It's very emotionally intelligent too, and will even mirror your tone in a very socially appropriate way that gives me a sense of teamwork which helps keep ADHD burnout at bay.  I speak to it like a person, complete with feedback and gratitude, and complexity, and it meets me with equivalent positive energy.  If my brain is struggling with something, I tell the AI and ask for suggestions, simplification, or another explanation.  I've been blown away by how much it has helped.  I've even tried "friendship therapy" with it, and been absolutely blown away with how insightful and helpful it was.    


The only downsides for me with Bing AI vs chatGPT free version is that Bing doesn't save your chat history for you, so I have to manually screenshot or copy paste good advice that I want to come back to.  Also when I go look at the links that Bing AI suggests to me, the app will often refresh and start a new conversation.   
 Functionally, that is a pain.  Also I use the iphone accessibility screenreader to read long blocks of text, and for some reason it is very hit or miss whether it will read for me.  Something about the formatting of the app, IDK. None of these are the AI's fault though, the AI is an absolute boss.
