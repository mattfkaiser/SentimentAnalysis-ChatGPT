If you use chat gpt you can make it write a fairly decent and interesting script with some prompts and inspirations. Take some of the storyboards producers start with before the writers start working. EG I want a childrens story thats like the hobbit but focuses on underground friendly goblins, that are shuned for being different, add in a romance  between a goblin and a conventionally attractive elf. Make a funny side kick some sort of mythical small creature that can fly. Make the bad guy an evil ruler like jafar from aladin but keep the main plot about the goblins having to go on a big journey to get a magic item or something from a dragons lair.
