Yea I'll also add that as a "fresh" senior dev here, I argued for like 30 minutes the other day with chatGPT over a fairly complex regex and it still couldn't figure out what the problem was. I realized the issue and so it acted like an advanced rubber duck... but it didn't solve my problem. And I was just being lazy and had someone tell me that it was great for regex, so I was expecting a 20 second trip down chatGPT lane to fix my regex with no effort. Didn't happen lol. I know eventually these things will be able to pump out some great code, but i feel like they're going to have to be programming specific because I can see maintain an AI written codebase being a real pain in the ass.
