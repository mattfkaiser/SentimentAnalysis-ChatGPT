College professor here. 

Can also confirm that your professor is not being unreasonable. First, they did not say, "You cheated using ChatGPT." That was your interpretation. They said that the work was "flagged for a high rate of AI." Very different things. Take a few deep breaths and try not to take it personally. 

I was taught to always presume innocence until proven guilty. I had this very same conversation less than a month ago with a college student. I open conversations about cheating by asking, "Tell me about your process in writing/doing this assignment." I WANT to hear how they did it. If you can believe this, we professors are humans with feelings too, and it stinks to file academic misconduct reports. Most of us are in this profession because we love learning and sharing knowledge with others, not to catch students red handed.

Tell-tale signs of cheating for me are when a student gets super defensive/argumentative, changes their story a lot, gets red or shows other signs of nervousness, or eagerly accepts the opportunity to redo the assignment (if it was the student's original work in the first place, why would they be so eager to rewrite it?). 

SO, as long as you remain: calm, keep your professor's side of things in perspective, clearly state that you did not use ChatGPT, and show evidence of your work, you will be fine. 

This might also be a great learning opportunity for you, and could potentially be a story to share during job interviews to describe a situation where you worked successfully with a professor to resolve an academic conflict stemming from a technological misunderstanding. Keep notes. Best of luck.
