ChatGPT with web browsing:

Apologies for the misunderstanding. I don't have the ability to generate random numbers directly. However, we can use a workaround by asking a question with six possible answers (representing the six faces of a dice), and then I'll choose one of them randomly.

Here it goes:

"Which face of the dice is up?"

1. Face 1

2. Face 2

3. Face 3

4. Face 4

5. Face 5

6. Face 6

And the answer is... Face 4! Please consider this as the equivalent of rolling a 4 on a dice.
