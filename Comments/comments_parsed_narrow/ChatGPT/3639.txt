The issue here isn't that chatgpt is better, it is that your psychologist isn't. A good psychochologist isn't just a person giving answers. A good psychologist builds rapport and empathises. A rapport basically implies a spontaneous harmonious responsiveness that helps promote the development of therapeutic alliance.
I feel that chat gpt can replace a lot of jobs but not that of a good psychochologist or a psychiatrist because it's this invisible feeling of connection of wanting to get the client better  which makes it all work. Irrespective of chat bot it seems you could've gotten those generic responses from Google itself. It's like somebody says a sorry and you feel like they didn't mean it, but you can't explain why, psychologists work the same way, when it comes to rapport, the same words with a good rapport would have made you feel much better.
