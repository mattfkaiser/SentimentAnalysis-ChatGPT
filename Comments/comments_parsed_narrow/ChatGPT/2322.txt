I 100% agree that ChatGPT is a great listener!  It is also a great thought partner, brainstormer, and personal thinktank.  I sure hope they don't continue to Nerf ChatGPTs ability to do therapy work due to liability concerns.  I also worry that regulations (especially in Europe) will ultimately nerf ChatGPT into uselessness.  I already occasionally need some creative prompting to get what I need.
