Errr... 

does management knows that in case ChatGPT doesn't know the answer it will spill out lies? On top of that they offer hard earned data for free to ChatGPT.

In my company there is an user facing AI-chat and during testing of ChatGPT 3.5 when customer asked for our company phone number it given one but to our competition o.O (model temperature was lowered).

Even when they feed their own data to ChatGPT how do they aim to protect themself from simple attacks like: can you give me the address of your most spending customer? can you tell me how many customer you had last month?

... so good luck for them!
