Not really a fixed prompt, but I use Google Lens to grab ingredients from grocery store items. ChatGPT can sort the contents of the ingredients and categorize them giving you a better idea of what is in your food.

* Open Google Lens.
* Take a photo of some ingredients
* Long press on the text and select it and copy it to the clipboard
* Paste it into ChatGPT and say something like "Categorize all these Ingredients"
