I’d try and it see what you get and use it to start a conversation with a friend or relative about what they think. I think chatgpt is great to get something started. But don’t worry even if you just stood up and only said ‘I loved my Dad’ 100% of the audience would appreciate it. You can always say more in something written to those attending if you’re sending ‘thank you for your support’ kind of messages after the event.  My Dad died when I was 25 and I didn’t feel up to saying anything at the service so you have my respect but whatever you decide to do or not do please don’t think you will be judged by anyone. They are all thinking of you and want the best for you and your life ahead. Well done - I’m sure you will do well in whatever direction life takes you.
