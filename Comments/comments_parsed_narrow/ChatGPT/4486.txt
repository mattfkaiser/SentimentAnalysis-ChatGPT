ChatGPT is banned at my company in Denmark as well. Call that a dystopian country if you will.

Banning a chatbot because of the risk employees leaking confidential data has nothing to do with "land of the free". Most people are dumb as shit, and WILL copypaste confidential data without thinking twice.
