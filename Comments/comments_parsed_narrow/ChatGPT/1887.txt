I tried using bard yesterday to search for papers, it gave some titles and summaries but provided no links, when told to give me the links it made up bullshit. ChatGPT browser and Bing both found the papers and provided the correct links. I just wish they could do more extensive searches or limit themselves to special search engines like google scholar (not sure where they are actually searching)
