There's definitely potential for subtler forms of advertising in chatgpt and general generative AI. Portraying a brand or product in a particular way, or including them more frequently as examples of categories, or in stories, or whatever. There will definitely be "native" ads of this type once finer-grained control is realized (or I guess even just with prompts now, though probably clumsily, I haven't tried)
