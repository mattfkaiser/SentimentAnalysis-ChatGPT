>  Today I tried to get the idea of sine and cosine under my skin, amd asked GPT why I couldn't use sine to find the other lengths and angles of the triangle, and gave me a very good explanation. 

That's incredibly impressive. I've always struggled to get a good handle on math, I'll have to try again with ChatGPT and some old textbooks.
