Learn about langchain, GPT 4 stand alone is different than, GPT w/ search or plugins. I notice this when it started botsplaining how it couldn’t output information as a table when the day before it was doing it. They are changing the initial prompt that goes to each request, ie; gpt4, search, plugins, interpreter. This is because they are going to monetize each section. ChatGPT code interpreter is where you’ll have to go to send it images to follow as a design guideline or understand how to view content based on the context requested. You’ll have to learn how to reprompt your request and remember to understand which gpt version you are using.
