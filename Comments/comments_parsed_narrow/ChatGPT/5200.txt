As I've heard, ChatGPT agrees with anything that it thinks or assumes to be true. So if I give it some essay then it would see if is it possible for ChatGPT to write this, could it have been ChatGPT who wrote it? And answers based on that. If you give it something with very messed up grammar, then it will most likely say no, it didn't, but there is still a possibility of it saying yes, because we can prompt it to give answers which are grammatically incorrect.
