Rlhf which is the process by which OpenAI “aligns” chatGPT specifically for conversation.

One piece of data which is not included into rlhf is the identity of the current user.

If chatgpt doesn’t know who it’s talking to it assumes it’s talking to the mean of possible people.

My theory is that if it could tell who it’s talking to it can be smarter in more cases.
