You’re not looking at the right perspective for the Internet. 

Nothing has grown faster than ChatGPT. Internet access only really became ubiquitous 20 years ago. I’d say that ChatGPT and other generative AI is for regular people about as accessible as the Internet was 20 years ago. 

If we’re looking at the potential for businesses 30 years ago may be similar in untapped potential for the Internet, but late 90’s is where it’s at. 

But comparing the two is a bit weird. One is a product derived from and dependent on the other. 

It’s a bit like asking if highways will change how we travel as much as cars did. Not “will flying cars change how we travel as much as cars did?”. 

Talking of AI, autonomy will change how we travel. And how we view car ownership. Fundamentally. 

What is always hard to project is the rate of progress. 

Certain technologies can make sudden leaps showing signs of exponential progress for then only to plateau. 

In the early to mid 90’s they thought VR was going to be the next big thing. 

15-12 years ago everyone seemed to think it was 3D TV, but it turned out to be just a fad so we luckily got 4K instead. 

There are hype cycles to any trend, and some things sustain on hype and trend alone, like crypto or pyramid schemes (not saying they’re different things). 

Other products and ideas fail to win the hearts and minds due to lack of hype, even though they’re promising and good.

Personally what I find interesting is how much some things have changed along the way. 

27 years ago we would gather friends and family in the office and sing Karaoke with a full screen karaoke software with karaoke files which were basically just midi files with lyrics and timing. 

Then Singstar came along and after a few years of that no-one has ever really talked about singing Karaoke again. Somehow it just died out. 

Now when the families meet people pull up their phones and spend their time on social media, showing funny/interesting stuff, or pictures and videos. 

But at least my car has *Caraoke* software built in, that I pull out every once in a while for fun when I have new people in the car.
