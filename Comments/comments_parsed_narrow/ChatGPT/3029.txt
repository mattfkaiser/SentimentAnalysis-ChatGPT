If I were in your place I would change my focus toward working with it rather than against it.  Sometimes things just change and we have to relearn our position.   I think if I were you I would propose making an anonymizer that would take your information, anonymize and protect the sensitive information before sending it to GPT, and then taking the ChatGPT output and put it back in the original form.   That way your company could save money and keep the privacy for your company and clients, and maybe keep your job too.
