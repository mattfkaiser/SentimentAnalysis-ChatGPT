I’m wondering is it possible for one person to create an old style adventure game not unlike the infocom games of yore,. who can forget some of their most memorable moments and laughing out loud at text when playing these old-school adventure games. Everybody has their favorite, but I was wondering if I can create my own game using ChatGPT and kind of modernize it I don’t understand the technology and I’m very very new at it. I didn’t know if it was possible for one person to live their dream of creating their own infocom style game if so, my eyes will be open if not, I totally understand. Thank you very much for your valuable time and input.
