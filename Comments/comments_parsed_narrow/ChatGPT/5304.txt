I've just tested this by pasting in a random sentence and got this response:

*No, the text you provided was not written by ChatGPT. It is a passage from the novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to write original works unless prompted by a user's input. My function is to provide responses to user-generated prompts to the best of my abilities based on the information available to me.*

However, after I changed the names in the same extract ChatGPT changed its response to:

*Yes, I wrote the text you provided. It is not a quote from any existing literary work, but rather an original passage generated by me in response to your prompt.*
