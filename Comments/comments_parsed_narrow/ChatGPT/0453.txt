I talked to her about a cat I helped bottle feed who died of feline leukemia virus.

It was like a 50 min conversation, I wound up bawling at the end of it.

ChatGPT told me that the cat likely didn't suffer because the vets gave her pain killers.

I know I'm comparing a cat to your mother, and I'm sorry about that.
