Thanks, I edited the post to "therapist". English is not my mother tongue. Her role is to listen to parents in crisis mode with their children. So, 'therapist' is probably more accurate. 

In our crisis situation I don't find her helpful. We've been talking to her since Oct 22 and it's not really helping me with what I am facing.

ChatGPT also gave me cookie cutter answers but also recommendations that were more useful and actionable.
