I also use it frequently for homework/studying. 

In the statistics class I’m taking, many of my textbook’s explanations are very technical and difficult to understand when describing certain concepts, so I just copy/paste the text (PDF textbook) into ChatGPT and ask it to explain the concept to me in a different way (or in a more conversational manner). Then, I usually ask follow-up questions about specific elements of said text.

It’s been incredibly helpful since it’s almost like having a personal tutor sitting there to answer all my questions without getting tired or frustrated.
