Question that nobody seems to be able to answer: if I used Chat GPT to summarize an article for university would my prof have a way of knowing I did that? Not looking for hate, just struggling through some filler course while I’m in the last year of my degree program. Not worth much, they’re just like little weekly summaries I have to submit, ABSOLUTELY NOT worth being dismissed for academic misconduct so if I have even any doubt I won’t try this (Havnt yet and I’m almost done :P) But I’m also a young single mom of 2 kids, working full time, and paying my own way through this so I can use any assistance stress relief wise that I can get ;P
