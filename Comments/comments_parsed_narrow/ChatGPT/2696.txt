I mean whatever lol but thats basically what it is.

Heres an article describing it. [ChatGPT vs GPT](https://zapier.com/blog/chatgpt-vs-gpt/)

ChatGPT is an app built on top of GPT3 (or GPT4). 

GPT is the engine that provides ChatGPT the LLM to converse with.

ChatGPT has all of the content filters.

GPT3/4 *can* access the internet (but is restricted using ChatGPT) in the same way that it *can* access the time. 

GPT3/4 is a LLM but it also describes the other systems associated. Like the ability to search things on the internet has nothing to do with a LLM but we still say its a feature of GPT3/4.

Where am i wrong?
