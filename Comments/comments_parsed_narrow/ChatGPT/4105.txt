* Privacy
* Someone is still needed to use the information being inputted, but again, it falls back to a privacy concern. ChatGPT is collecting data that other companies (invested or not invested) would prefer their "secrets" stay in-house.
* Fuck the shareholders. If they want to save money, they should use AI to replace the very top. The amount of money spent there is a waste. Top management thinks of plans, but ultimately, the bottoms are the ones that implement and execute these changes. The amount of money they can cut from top management will make shareholders happy.
