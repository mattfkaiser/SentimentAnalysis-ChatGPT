I use ChatGPT constantly. It's basically my personal assistant who follows me around in life. I prefer it vastly over Googling something at this point, since it's way more interactive and has memory, so it can continue assisting me as I make revisions based on the back-and-forth I have with it.

I do pay for ChatGPT PRO / 4 subscription because of the vastly higher quality of GPT 4 over GPT 3.

Plugins are nice but not amazing (at least for me) yet because tools integration is lacking.

edit: Took the survey :)
