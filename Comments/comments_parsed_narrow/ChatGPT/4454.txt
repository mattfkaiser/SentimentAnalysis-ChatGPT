Yeah, I'd be more concerned about employees accidentally leaking PII and confidential information - especially if supposed to be our clients' data, as the firm as a whole would be on the hook for that. Consider too the multiple incidents that ChatGPT user chat histories have been exposed to other users by accident.

My company's own policy is to treat ChatGPT just like any public forum. You're free to ask questions on StackOverflow and file issues on GitHub, but you're definitely *not* allowed to illustrate those posts with anything internal.
