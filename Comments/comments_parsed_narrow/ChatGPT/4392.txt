> It definitely knows

"It" doesn't "know" anything because "knowing" is a thing only humans are capable of. The words "it knows" in this context are like saying my refrigerator knows lettuce; it isn't the same sense of the word "know" that we would use for a human. 

Google "knows" all the same information ChatGPT does. ChatGPT is often better than Google at organizing and delivering information that human users are looking for but the two products aren't really much different.
