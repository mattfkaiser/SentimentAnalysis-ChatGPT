I like learning, I hate having to parrot easily available information. I was about average in the IT classes at the university, while others were excellent students simply because they had better memorization skills - when it comes to coding, they were total 0.

If students cheat, it's because they don't care. ChatGPT would only simplify this process.

Education needs to change. It's time to move away from what we suck at (retaining information) and move towards something we are more suitable for (like abstract and logical thinking).

Enough ranting, now I am back to studying for yet another exam I don't care. You bet I am using ChatGPT for my tutor.
