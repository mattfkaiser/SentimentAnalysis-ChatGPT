Sorry for the slow reply. Basically pulling in all kinds of extra data. For example, I’m doing company sales prospecting so I have a huge list of companies I pulled from my normal data source. Then I wanted a company description for each company. So I created a new company description column and asked ChatGPT with the formula “=gpt(—-)” to answer the question of the company description. It gave the company description so easily and then I carried the formula down to all the other companies. Instant answers! Then I wanted to know if any of those company manufactured products in China. I used the same formula but with a different question and carried that formula down. Instant answers!! It’s not totally perfect, but it does the work for me in mass with very little work on my part! I’m a data analyst by trade and this is a new super tool for me. :)
