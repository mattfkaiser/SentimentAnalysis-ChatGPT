It's a pretty big accusation if you've paid a lot of money for college and you fail because chat GPT allegedly wrote your paper. That accusation can have a significant monetary value attached to it. 

I agree the industry will adapt, but this won't come from degree level education, which is notoriously slow to move on and adapt to change, unless of course their hand is forced. I think at some point soon, the wrong kid will get failed for allegedly using chat GPT, and their daddy's lawyer will want a word; from there, academia will start adapting.
