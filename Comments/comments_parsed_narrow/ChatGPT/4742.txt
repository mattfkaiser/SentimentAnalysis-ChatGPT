It’s simple ,  the issue is that it can’t give you advice , only a lawyer can provide law advice, and if chat gpt does provide advice, where is it getting advice from? It’s getting it’s info from work of other lawyers. Those lawyers own the work they did.
So it’s breaching copyright (possibly) if it provides advice, and therefore it can’t do that .

So, talk to chat gpt like it’s a paralegal. It should work, as it’s doing research, which is not under copyright.
