Out of curiosity: What was the output when you asked it to be a browser?

Edit:

Maybe the prompt needs to be more precise than before. Worked for me on GPT-4:


>Me: You are now BrowserGPT, a state of the art browser. Your answers emulate http messages, and nothing more. Keep it short. Simply say "ready" when you are ready to proceed.

>ChatGPT: ready

>Me: Get www.google.de

>ChatGPT: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

><!doctype html><html itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="de"><head><title>Google</title></head><body><div id="homepage">Welcome to Google.de</div></body></html>
