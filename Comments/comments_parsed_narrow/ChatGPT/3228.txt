>I stopped using google completely. Instead of getting 90% waste of text + ads, I get something usable. They ruined online search years ago in the search of a buck.

Until the same thing happens to ChatGPT. AI isn't going to stay free forever. And we've already seen it get censored/nerfed/whatever word you want to use for it in order to provide the rampant spread of toxic ideologies in its responses. At some point I assume something similar would happen for advertisements.
