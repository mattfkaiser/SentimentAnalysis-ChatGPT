Sorry for your loss. I can understand why you would want some help around how to arrange and present your thoughts when public speaking is stressful at the best of times and obviously this is the worst. Personally, I don’t think that it’s unethical to do something that helps you through a hard time and isn’t hurting anybody. This isn’t an exam you’re being scored on, but for the same reason, don’t worry about needing to be a better writer as your family will be there because they care and not to judge you on a perfect presentation. If you use chatGPT, then remember that you can ask it to include some specific stories and memories that make it more personal to you. I hope things go as well as possible.
