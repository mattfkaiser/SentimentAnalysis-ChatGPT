Yeah, especially when people use it to varying degrees! Some students will blindly copy paste including “written by ChatGPT” or whatever. But I recently used it to completely reformat my resume. I wrote little summaries on what I did in my positions and asked it to elaborate and edit it to sound coherent. Then I edited the response to my own liking and told it to reformat to bullet points and edited that to my liking. Made it so much easier for me but I still actively participated in the creation and final product. I wasn’t really seeking to hide the fact I used AI but by the very nature of how I used it, trademarks might have been edited out or obscured.
