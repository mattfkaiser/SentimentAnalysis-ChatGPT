>I hope this email finds you well.

I would delete this from any future e-mails you send that are written by AI. ChatGPT puts it into nearly every e-mail, sometimes even if you explicitly tell it not to. At this point, if I see an e-mail start with "I hope this email finds you well", I basically just assume automatically that it was written by ChatGPT and not an actual person. And I bet I'm not alone.
