I've been running mpt-7b-chat, GPT4all-13b-snoozy, and nous-hermes-13b (the strongest model I can get to run comfortably on my PC, as the 33b+ Llama models are outside my processor range) all on my 3.3 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS, with 16GBs of 2-channel DDR4 SODIMM, and an 8GB Nvidia Geforce RTX 3070 (not barebones, but obviously a pretty mid-tier consumer rig). I've test driven other models, but most open source is shit, these three are just the best performing ones I've been able to run (I could definitely handle Vicuna-13b, but it's not looked like enough of a performance enhancement to be worth the hassle) and for the types of prompts I commonly use, the responses from these models are *close* to ChatGPT, which I have extensive experience with. I also use BingAI daily, which I recall hearing was running on GPT4 (though that might have been a rumor) so I have a good idea what the OpenAI models are capable of and what the responses look like. Some of the Snoozy responses, for example, UNQUESTIONABLY outcompete ChatGPT for creative writing quality, though they can be hit and miss, (as my understanding is the model was trained on GPT4 outputs so when you try to drill deep it can have odd gaps in understanding, but most times a facsimile of true comprehension is just as good as the real thing). 

Disclaimers though are I don't depend on these OS models for coding or facts, so I'm not the best judge of where they compete on things like hallucination and bugs. Creative writing is my space, and in that area hallucination is a feature, not a bug. Ha!

edit: oh, and hermes is a COMPLETELY uncensored model, which is nice to have access to when you get sick of content filters on the OpenAI ecosystem. A nice perk of dipping your toes into the Open Source pool. Want a model that will tell you to go fuck yourself (if you ask) while it gives you accurate instructions to cook meth? Not sure why you'd want that, but hermes will do it! :)
