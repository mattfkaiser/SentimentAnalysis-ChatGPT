Couldnâ€™t resist :: The flaws in the logic presented are as follows:

1. The conclusion that generative AI is not a world-shaking revolution is based solely on the percentage of US adults who find ChatGPT significantly useful. This overlooks the broader impact and potential of generative AI beyond ChatGPT alone.

2. The study's findings focus on the current adoption and perception of ChatGPT among US adults. It does not necessarily reflect the entire landscape of generative AI or its future development. Drawing broad conclusions about the entire field based on a single application is not accurate.

3. The notion of something being "revolutionary" is subjective and depends on various factors such as context and long-term effects. While the study's findings suggest limited adoption and impact of ChatGPT, it doesn't necessarily negate the possibility of generative AI having revolutionary implications in other domains or over a longer time frame.

It's important to consider that technology adoption and societal impact often take time to unfold fully. Assessing the potential of generative AI requires a broader examination of its applications, advancements, and the evolving perspectives of experts in the field.
