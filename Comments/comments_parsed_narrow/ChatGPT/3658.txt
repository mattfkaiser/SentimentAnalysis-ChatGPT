As a therapist I say: go and find a better therapist who's willing to delve deeper and help you based on your unique situation rather than giving basic-level therapy. Sounds like your one is prioritising money and seeing as many people as possible and lacks the motivation to, you know, actually help you.

I think ChatGPT is great as a supplemental tool for therapy. But it won't set (therapy)goals with you, it won't hold you accountable after you set those goals, it lacks curiosity to ask you questions, it lacks the knowledge to ask the -right- questions, and anything you ask it will still result in generic answers that you can find on the internet. 

I don't doubt that AI will find its way into mental healthcare and has a place to stay there but it's not that advanced yet.
