ChatGPT has helped me understand, navigate, and compare the way I experience and process the world. It’s helped me understand the extent of my memory loss and connect the dots between my physical, neurological, and mental difficulties. 

It takes pages and pages of details across multiple conversations and humors every question big or small. In my most recent psychiatry appointment— it was 80% relaying the highlights of my conversation and 20% insights, questions, and action plan development.

My issues are extensive. Over-thinking and over-processing is a big challenge— and to be able to humor that in a short & productive way that leads to self-reflection and insights is wild. 

ChatGPT changed my life in every way. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
