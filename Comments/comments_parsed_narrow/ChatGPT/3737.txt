I see more and more posts like this. I think some people really overestimate chat gpt. Even if it will be undistinguishable from actual person output, it has a tiny flaw: it's still not a person. In certain situations we need to interact with human, otherwise this interaction becomes worthless. And psychologist, imo, it's exactly such kind of job.

Don't know, maybe in the future it really will not matter who you interact with, but today I feel we still very human centered society.
