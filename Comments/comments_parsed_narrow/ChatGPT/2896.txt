I use chatGPT everyday to help me with content for websites, blogs and product descriptions. I can tell you some things it says and ways it says things, but first I want to mention that I don't think you should be trying so hard to find out if students are using LLMs or AI to help the write, or to write. It's going to be continually changing and the way AI / ChatGPT writing will be different 4 months from now or 4 minutes from now depending on the type of prompt. There are so many ways to get AI to write differently. You can even give it samples of your own writings and then ask it to write something else in that style. Or someone's twitter handle that was notable enough to be part of its training data can be referenced as a style to write in.  


That being said. It talks like this...  


"hidden gem" - Says something is a ' hidden gem' if its describing a useful item or place or whatever

"nestled in" If talking about a city or town, it likes to say in the into, "nestled in Scottsdale, AZ"

"a wide array" to explain many things or diverse options or services or features.

"Let's delve into \[whatever topic\]"

"Additionally"

"It's important to remember that"

It does these things in Headings / Titles...

"\[whatever topic\]: A Comprehensive Guide"

"ChatGPT AI Writing: A Game-Changer In Students Ability To Cheat" (uses the colon alot in titled and headings, and likes to say 'game-changer'  too)

And that's all I can remember for now but there is lots more. I didnt refer to my ChatGPT conversations for this I just gave it off the top of my head.
