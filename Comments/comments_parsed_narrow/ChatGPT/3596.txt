ðŸ“¢ This is how I made it and which tools I used: 

ChatGPT: to generate the wished promts to get the result I wished for.

Midjourney: to generate the first picture of the Lion you see in frame one. 

KaiberAI: to generate the video, you decide about the camera movement and adjust it with further prompts. There you also add a bad ass track and fit the video towards it.



The question if this is art I leave to everyone personal. Art has the purpose to polarize. And keep in mind even a Dali thrones on the shoulders of all generations before him. To create something completely unique is impossible, but you can come closer if you try to mix as many small existing fractures together to get a full "new" picture. 

I made this with love and it took me time, it's not done by just one click. And who doesn't appreciate a badass trippy lion with 5 legs, it's your problem! ;-)
