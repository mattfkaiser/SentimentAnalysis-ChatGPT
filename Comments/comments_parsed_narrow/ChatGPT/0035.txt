Yeah this is all just kind of a huge shit show. 

Like yeah, the ultimate point of these systems is to identify plagiarism, and if you just copy the Bible or the constitution as your own work, that would definitely be plagiarism (and weird as fuck). 

But the problem I have is that these AI detection systems have the same problem the AI chat bot systems have - they can be wrong for any reason and no one can really explain why or how. Teachers, in a position of power over students, are at risk of blindly using this tool and being led to make false conclusions regarding plagiarism (to the detriment of the students). Ironically, this is probably exactly what the teachers would say about the students and chat GPT.
