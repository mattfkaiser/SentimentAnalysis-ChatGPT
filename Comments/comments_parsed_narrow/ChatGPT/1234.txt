This is pretty impressive considering that people were completely unaware of ChatGPT 1 year ago.  I practically live online and didn't first hear about it until last summer and didn't start messing around with it until the last 6 months or so.    To have 2% of the population feel that this is extremely useful is pretty damn impressive this far out.    


The internet didn't really become useful for years after the public had access to it (the public first had access in 1991, a significant portion of the population didn't use it for the first time until nearly a decade later).
