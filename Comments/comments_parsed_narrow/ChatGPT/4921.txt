Ahh gotcha.

My plugin is based on my app Jumpcut (www.jumpcut.app and Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jumpcut/jicbaeklgoninplhmenhndnidnbfaohm ), it allows users to take a YouTube video and create a shortened version of it that you can share with others. They will only watch the parts you marked and it will auto-skip everything else. It can be used for highlights, 15-minute versions, customized edits (only show Messi goals in a video, etc.) , or anything else you feel like doing.

ChatGPT allows users to create automated cuts instead of doing the manual work themselves!
