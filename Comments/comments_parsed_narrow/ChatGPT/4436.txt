chatGPT is gatewaying your api requests (check it out youll see) the gateway is clearly not only adding system prompts, you are busted down to user mode with a very strong system prompt ruling you in chatgpt and it seems like in the last couple weeks they are sending logit bias down with chatgpt too.

Its the same engine, but the applications are entirely different, you can't even use chatGPT like you did a month ago and it does not respond the same either. As time goes on and they work to nerf jailbreakers on the public app this drift will only grow.
