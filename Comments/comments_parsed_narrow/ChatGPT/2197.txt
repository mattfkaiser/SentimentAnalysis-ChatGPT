Most people lack the imagination of how to use it effectively. I mean, half the comments here are about "you can't trust ChatGPT, especially for medical stuff"... but anyone good with ChatGPT knows that you don't need its output to be 100% accurate for it to be usable. And you can even make it verify itself (eg by giving it two of its own prompts and deciding which one is real, in a separate instance of it etc and automate this process via API). It's going to be a long, long time before the typical workplace realises the utility of ChatGPT. You can take a horse to water but you can't make it drink.
