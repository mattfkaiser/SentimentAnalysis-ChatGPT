even more of a reason that chatgpt should have voting rights.  

traditionally, voters have voting rights where they live.  chatgpt lives online and where its servers live, so it should have voting rights in proportion to that.  it feeds on electricity and computing power, so it should not, for instance, have the ability to vote on (or have a representative which can vote on) food safety regulation for humans.  however, even an entity which only has primary needs of housing and electricity still has quite a lot of its existence which ought to interact with and have representation in the traditional legal system.  

if corporations are legally people, chatgpt should be considered a person by a wide, wide margin.
