Ha, no. SF/F, but it's nice to have options, since the content filters can sneak up in unexpected ways and get in the way of your work flow while you try to come up with a prompt hack to get around the AI not wanting to describe a character of a certain ethnic background or something equally absurd. Most of the 13b or less parameter GPT4all OS models running on a LoRa port can run on ~13GBs or less of RAM with mid-tier processor, but I also play around with some of the Stable Diffusion models and those are GPU intensive. (great for producing cover art and character sketches on the cheap!)

edit: just as a point of illustration, I've run into content filtering if the AI decides a stereotyped character's description is arbitrarily "too offensive". Like, for instance, I was using ChatGPT once to develop backstory for a minor side character who I wanted to vaguely fit a country hick stereotype but with some unique attributes that I was specifying. Nope. Content filter. That's an "offensive" stereotype. Fuck that, let me boot up Hermes and get this shit done. That's just the first thing that comes to mind, but I honestly think the content filtering causes more problems than it solves and [BEGIN RANT] >!treats users like children incapable of making their own damn decisions about what ought to be appropriate and take personally responsibility for distributing content. Why can't these doofus's ask us to sign a liability waiver and turn off the child lock?? So frustrating. It's like going to a restaurant to order a beer and being told you can only get apple juice and it has to be served in a sippy cup, even if you're a goddamn adult.!< [END RANT]

edit2: oh, and I linked an easy install walkthrough that should work on most PCs in this other comment, in case you were interested in following through on your intention to "build my own for the uncensored aspects" as you indicated above.
