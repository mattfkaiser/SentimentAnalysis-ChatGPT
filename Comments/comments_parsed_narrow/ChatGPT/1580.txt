if you googled how to start a real estate company or beginner's chess, could you explain why chatgpt did such a better job explaining this to you instead of the numerous resources outlining the steps available that plenty of successfully used in the past? i have started a real estate business as well and found the steps very straight forward on google. i didn't learn to play chess, but I learnt to play blackjack and poker by googling and I imagine the resource are similiar.

again, there are many email templates available on google for every type of email, explanations of vitamins and multivitamins, free legal document templates etc.

with posts likes these, the majority of stuff is usually easily accomplished through google already. not saying chatgpt is not useful or has no use, I just don't see it doing anything groundbreaking or very different most of the time. yes it personalizes content based on your input, but again, there are plenty of services that do this.

before chat chatgpt, there are plenty of legal services and resume/cv building services that allowed you to enter your info, and it would create it based on that. could chatgpt do a better job in some cases? yes. could existing services do a better job in some cases? yes I think so as well.
