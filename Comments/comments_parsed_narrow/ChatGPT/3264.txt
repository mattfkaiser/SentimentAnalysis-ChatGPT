I was one of the first 250,000 Internet users as a kid. At 36, I readily tell people now that ChatGPT (or its underlying AI) is one of the biggest three things I've seen change the world in my life. The Internet was the first, cell phones (esp. smartphones) were the second, and this is undoubtedly the newest one on the list. I think it's every bit as significant as the advent of the Internet.
