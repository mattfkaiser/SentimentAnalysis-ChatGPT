I spent decades as an English professor and University administrator. I love the field. But I understand why so many of our colleagues are lining up to retire, and it has little to do with cheating. The situation is existential. In a world where ChatGPT exists, what's the point of teaching writing? There will be no jobs for the majority of our graduates: ChatGPT already writes better than they do. For the best among them, there won't be any teaching posts, because the classrooms will be empty. Teaching writing will soon be about as useful as teaching students to use cuneiform on clay tablets. I don't blame anyone for jumping ship: there's no future in the profession.
