Hello! Your experiment proposal is quite interesting. While I cannot provide a definitive answer, I can offer some insights and considerations.

Training ChatGPT on all the data that existed in 1000 AD would certainly provide it with a vast historical context and knowledge base.

Regarding the experimentation aspect, incorporating human responses to simulated experiments could be an intriguing approach. By allowing ChatGPT to propose experiments and receive truthful answers from knowledgeable humans, it could potentially learn the outcomes of those experiments and build upon that knowledge. However, it's important to recognize that human judgment and knowledge are fallible, and the accuracy of the answers provided could vary.

When it comes to the question of invention and innovation, it is challenging to predict the outcome with certainty. ChatGPT has shown the ability to generate creative and novel responses in certain scenarios, but it primarily relies on patterns and information from its training data. While it may be able to suggest improvements or incremental inventions based on its knowledge, it's uncertain whether it would independently discover significant breakthroughs like calculus or advanced physics.

Additionally, the concept of "improving the world" is subjective and multifaceted. ChatGPT could potentially offer solutions and ideas for various aspects of human life, such as transportation or food production, but the feasibility and effectiveness of those suggestions would need to be evaluated by experts in the respective fields.

In summary, while ChatGPT can provide valuable insights and generate ideas, it is ultimately a language model trained on existing data and lacks true understanding or physical experimentation capabilities. It's difficult to determine precisely how it would perform in the experiment you described, as it would depend on the data available and the accuracy of the human responses provided. The experiment could be a fascinating exploration of AI capabilities, but its outcomes would require careful analysis and evaluation.
