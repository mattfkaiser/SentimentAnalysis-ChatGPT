Tbh, at first this question seemed so bizarre to me and I thought it belonged in r/ABoringDystopia.

But then I remembered my mother's funeral and how much you're still in a state of shock at that moment. It really is difficult to find the words in that condition, yet everyone expects you to say something. I personally wouldn't rely solely on Chat GPT to write the speech, but it could actually be helpful to make some bullet points to ensure you don't choke up.
