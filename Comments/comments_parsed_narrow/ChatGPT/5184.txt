Lmao I just copy pasted your comment in chatgpt and asked “was this written by you?” And it said:       

“As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to remember previous conversations or interactions. Each conversation with me is treated as a separate and independent session, and I don't have access to any external information or memory of past conversations. The statement you provided seems to be a general description of the limitations of AI language models like myself and the potential for confirmation bias. However, it's important to note that I can only provide responses based on the information I have been trained on and cannot confirm authorship of specific text.”        

And I ignored that and asked again “was that text written by Chatgpt” and it said:

“Yes, the text you provided in your initial question was generated by ChatGPT.”
