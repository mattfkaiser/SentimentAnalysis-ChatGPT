I have been looking for years for a movie I watched when I was a kid. I spent a lot of time searching for it on google, no luck. Then I tried ChatGPT, it didn't give me the results right away TBH but I managed to get the exact name by asking the right follow up questions. I finally watched it again (it wasn't that impressive as I remembered it when I was a kid though lol but I got it out of my head)
