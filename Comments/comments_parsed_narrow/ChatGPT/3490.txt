ChatGPT hasn't done the school stuff for me - I haven't used it for academic tasks - but it **has** increased my income a lot. By automating a lot of my freelance-work as a transcriber, I'm now making $40-55 an hour instead of just $13 an hour. It's been an absolute game-changer for me.

**Edit**: Since a lot of people have been asking me how to get this sort of job.....I was sort of a nepotism hire, unfortunately. = / I was only hired because my parents knew people, and it's a small private network/organization trying to get a lot of videos transcribed or captioned, I don't think they hire publicly. I wouldn't know how to get into other realms of transcription work either. Sorry...
