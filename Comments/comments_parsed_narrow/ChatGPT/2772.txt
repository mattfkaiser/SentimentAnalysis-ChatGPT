No, but I had ChatGPT write one:

\*\*Panel 1:\*\*

\*(Cueball is sitting at a computer, with Megan standing behind him.)\*

\*\*Cueball:\*\* "Hey, check this out. This AI can find an XKCD comic for any situation."

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*Panel 2:\*\*

\*(Megan leans in to look at the computer screen.)\*

\*\*Megan:\*\* "Really? Any situation?"

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*Panel 3:\*\*

\*(Cueball types into the computer.)\*

\*\*Cueball:\*\* "Yep. Let's see... 'AI finding relevant XKCD comic.'"

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*Panel 4:\*\*

\*(They both look at the computer screen, which displays a message: 'No relevant XKCD comic found.').\*

\*\*Cueball:\*\* "Well, almost any situation."

\*\*Megan:\*\* "Guess we just found the exception."

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*Alt-text:\*\* "The AI is still learning the concept of self-reference."

&#x200B;
