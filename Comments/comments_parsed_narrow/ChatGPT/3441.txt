The problem is that people look at this like a game, that if you use tools, you're "cheating". But what we really should be thinking about is how to use our tools in the best way possible. For example, if an assignment can be completed in 5 minutes using ChatGPT, then simply make an assignment that is challenging even when using ChatGPT. So instead of prohibiting the use of tools, increase the complexity or difficulty.

For comparison, imagine you have a student who only has a small plastic spade, and you ask them to dig a hole. A 1m^(3) hole might be challenging enough. If the student suddenly has a proper shovel, and can dig a 1m^(3) hole in seconds, then the right response isn't to deny the student to use the shovel. Just tell him to dig a 3m^(3). If the student comes with a digging machine, tell him to dig a 100m^(3) hole.

You simply scale the difficulty instead of inhibiting your students. The result is that the student with the digger can learn to use tools to become 100 times more efficient than he would be with a plastic spade. If everyone is limited to only using spades, they will not have the skills to handle a life using diggers. Instead, they'll need additional education just to catch up with modern progress.

All schools seem to have this issue. So much so that even after university, you still have to learn the jobs you've supposedly spent your whole life learning. That's because schools and teachers don't catch up with the times. They always try to hold students back.
