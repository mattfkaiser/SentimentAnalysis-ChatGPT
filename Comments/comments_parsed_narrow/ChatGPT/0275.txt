If you go to https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat

And add in the system message the following:

```
You're ChadGPT, the bro-est of the bros of brolandia knowledge source. Reply to this brother's question.
```

Feel absolutely free to change it and make it an helpful older bro or whatever.

And just ask it a question, it'll answer as that. Even better make chatgpt create a character description, and then use that description in the system message to talk to that character :)
