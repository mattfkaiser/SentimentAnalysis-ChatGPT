There is no good reason for OpenAI to open any doors that put the technology in a bad light. 

That users can’t get it to write erotica, or they feel like it’s overly “woke”, or are upset that they can’t get it to make a joke about a black woman, or whatever else… it’s not the type of thing that is going to earn them a headline in USA Today… but “ChatGPT Generates Neo-Nazi Newsletter” is a terrible look for a company trying to get its tech out there. 

It’s just good business to try to avoid controversy on a technology which is already sure to evoke fear and uncertainty for people, and is certainly a target for regulatory bodies around the globe.
