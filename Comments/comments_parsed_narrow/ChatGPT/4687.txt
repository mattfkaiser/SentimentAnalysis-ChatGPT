Hahahaha, loved that example.
But my point still stands. If you represent yourself you do so at your own risk. Regardless of where your information came from. 
I could see a time in the super near future where chatgpt will have a carved out portion that deals specifically with laws, medical, and finance. Each with their own disclaimer that using chatgpt as a professional comes with inherent risks. 
I am surprised they don't already give that disclaimer upfront.
