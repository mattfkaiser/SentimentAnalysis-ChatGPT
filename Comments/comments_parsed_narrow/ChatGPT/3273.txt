This is a great question and I'm about to date myself, but here we go.

So, as a member of Gen X (hi! Remember us? We're not baby boomers, millennials, or Gen Z. We're actually a generation), I remember reading an article many many moons ago on how we - Gen X - were the last generation to know what it was like before technology and after technology.

It's interesting looking back on using the original Macintosh computers, going to arcades, and of course, knowing how to fix an original Nintendo cartridge to literal PCs in your pocket is pretty wild (can't imagine how our grandparents feel). 

The fact that my work has started implementing into our tasks (I'm a copywriter) is enough for me to believe that it's significant now and will continue to be. Remember, computers were once just for governmental and educational research; home computers didn't honestly catch on until maybe the 1990s (they weren't cheap, so the regular mom/dad weren't shelling out money for the first ones). 

My industry (marketing) isn't the only one that's using it, so I believe once businesses start using it and learning it's effectiveness, it'll start being used for personal reasons. I actually have used it for personal reasons on the free account, just to see what I can ask and gleam, while I'm currently using how to use it more effectively and more efficiently at work.

Our CMO told one of my coworkers, when asked if ChatGPT would make our jobs as copywriters obsolete, he said something along the lines of "You aren't going to lose your job because of AI/ChatGPT; you will however lose it to someone who knows how to use it."
