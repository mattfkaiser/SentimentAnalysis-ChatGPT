Old grandpa.  Put my six year old grandson on my lap and fired up ChatGPT to write a story.   He chose to write about pirates.

He still prefers to write on paper because he likes to illustrate his stories with markers. Chat is a very productive tool I'm sure he will get back to.  But creativity is a human impulse.  

What we have unleashed will not replace us any more than tractors replaced farmers.  Many farmers needed other jobs. 

People will find other ways to be amazing.
