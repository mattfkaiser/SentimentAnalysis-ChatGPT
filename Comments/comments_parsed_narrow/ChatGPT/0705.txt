There's a lot of nuance to this.

Chat GPT often gets me 70-80% of the way there on diagnosing errors, explaining terrible code in natural language, and in general answering questions.

At the end of the day, it doesn't need to be right. It helps me understand the problem and come up with a solution in less time than google, stack overflow, and docs combined.

Langchain apps are showing to be pretty powerful in terms of complete programming solutions. They are very obviously not there yet. I've been developing with it for a bit now, and can definitely see it being similar to launch of chat gpt. One day, suddenly its just going to be "oh shit this actually works now"
