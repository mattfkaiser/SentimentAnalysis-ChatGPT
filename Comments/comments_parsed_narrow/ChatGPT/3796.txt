25301 is divisible by 11 or not

ChatGPT
To determine if a number is divisible by 11, you can use the following rule:

Add up the digits in the odd-numbered positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) and then add up the digits in the even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.).
Subtract the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions from the sum of the digits in the odd-numbered positions.
If the result is divisible by 11 (i.e., the remainder is 0), then the original number is also divisible by 11.
Applying this rule to the number 25301, we get:

Sum of digits in odd-numbered positions: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
Sum of digits in even-numbered positions: 5 + 0 + 1 = 6
Difference: 6 - 6 = 0
Since the difference between the sums is 0, which is divisible by 11, we can conclude that the number 25301 is divisible by 11.

Sum of digits in even-numbered positions: 5 + 0 + 1 = 6 but odd no. is 2 3 1 and even no. is 5 0 so how come 1

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions should be 5 + 0 = 5, not 5 + 0 + 1 = 6.

So applying the divisibility rule for 11 to the number 25301, we get:

Sum of digits in odd-numbered positions: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
Sum of digits in even-numbered positions: 5 + 0 = 5
Difference: 6 - 5 = 1
Since the difference between the sums is not divisible by 11 (i.e., the remainder is 1), we can conclude that the number 25301 is not divisible by 11. I apologize for the mistake in my previous responses.

okay so 25301 is divisible by 11 or not

ChatGPT
No, 25301 is not divisible by 11. As we calculated in the previous message, the difference between the sums of the digits in the odd-numbered positions and even-numbered positions is 1, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, we can conclude that 25301 is not divisible by 11.
