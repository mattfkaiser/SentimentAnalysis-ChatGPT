This is a free tool that we built to have a bit of fun with GPT-4 (and because if AI is threatening to replace artists and content writers, we thought it should have a good go at dethroning Gordon Ramsay too).

You can try it yourself at [heyhoku.com/roast-my-meal](https://heyhoku.com/roast-my-meal).

If you do manage to impress GPT, please share your glorious meal. And then probably go apply to Le Cordon Bleu or something.

Happy to answer any questions about how we built/prompted it, the tech stack, limitations etc.

P.S. Not for the faint hearted. Use with caution and a thick skin.

**Edit:** We've been overwhelmed by the positive response here, thank you. To all those feeding in some 18+ rated images, I believe you have been appropriately sassed by GPT.

Roast My Meal is actually just one (quite silly) feature of a larger project we are working on, [Hoku](https://heyhoku.com), a free AI-powered personal health coach. Think ChatGPT but synced with all your wearable health data, that learns from your health profile & preferences and gives you expert support & tools. There's a [waiting list](https://heyhoku.com) on the site if you're interested. Hope to see you there!

**Edit 2:** Ah you lovely bunch of masochists! We blew past our budget limit, currently working on 'deprecating' it from using GPT4 to GPT3.5 so that we can resume services.

**Edit 3:** OK, we are back in action. The tool is now using GPT3.5 so you might notice a slight decrease in the quality of sass. Your egos might be spared now, you're welcome.
