I did use ChatGPT in an assignment and got caught. I was called to a preliminary meeting and they asked me how I planned and write my assignments, it was all very informal and they were just trying to establish my writing style etc. I immediately confessed to my transgression, but my point is, maybe you should just go and have a conversation with your tutor without all guns blazing, and see what they have to say first.
