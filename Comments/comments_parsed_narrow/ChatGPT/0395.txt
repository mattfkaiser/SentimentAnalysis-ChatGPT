ChatGPT is actually an awesome use for D&D fans, I have used it several times (none that have been implemented as I am not currently DMing) to give me NPC ideas, magic item ideas, and story hook ideas. 

It’s limited to generic ideas as it can’t access IPs like critical role if you’re interested in something specific like that but it’s pretty cool still.
