Iâ€™ve been using Chat GPT to teach me how to use Unity by making my dream game! Itâ€™s already functioning surprisingly. I always say it doesnâ€™t just build the game, but it is exceptionally good at teaching me how to do it myself. I would never have picked up this hobby otherwise but it will be complete and on steam in 6 months! Itâ€™s also a very simple game without much reliance on rendering, visual assets, animations etc. since itâ€™s a business simulator game. Iâ€™m actually having fun playing my own game ðŸ¤“
