Within that same post someone asked OP what the denied prompt was, then provided screenshot proof that ChatGPT did, in fact, replied successfully to that prompt.

To which OP was like 'oh wow i just tried and it worked'

Sometimes re-phrasing prompts is as important as the prompt itself, and some people just like to create posts whining about how something's now shit and how it used to be better. I wouldn't take it as truth unless they provide some evidence. This is the internet, after all.
