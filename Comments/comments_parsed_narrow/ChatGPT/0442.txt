From my experiances, nothing will help you more than talking about it. Im happy you had a good experiance talking with the Chatgpt in that way. You may find as yime goes on you still need to talk about ot multiple times. If you ever feel the need to unburden your struggles, understand that its ok and natural to feel pain and anguish. Even if its chatgpt, a random internet stranger, or a therapist... talking helps. Feel free to talk to me anytime. I want to help. This offer goes out to everybody who wants help. I suffered from PTSD for a long time before I opened up and talked to someone about it. As soon as I did my most serious symptoms litarally vanished overnight.
