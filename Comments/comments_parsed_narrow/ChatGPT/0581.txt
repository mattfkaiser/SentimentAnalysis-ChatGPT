Nice to finally see this tool used for something useful and beneficial for all.

This (OP's post) is just a 'random' shot at the subjects, just imagine how it would be with serious work being done and without the 'people in power' to lobby their agenda.

But know 'they' are also using the new (not new but improved) tool to 'keep us in line'.

99.99% of people using ChatGpt is the pursuit of money, money.... money. Use the tool for something that benefits all.

The capitalistic way of doing and the mindset is so old and obsolete. You know it, I know it, ChatGpt knows it, a child know it and everybody knows it. But is anybody seriously trying to fix it? 

The hardest opponents are the 'gatekeepers' that will fight for their right (chance) to become part of the 1%'rs.
