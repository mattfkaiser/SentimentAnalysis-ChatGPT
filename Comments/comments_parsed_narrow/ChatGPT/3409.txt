Psychology student here,  I use chatgpt to write assignments. Here's how it works : it never writes them well. It always leaves out some info I need to put into it. It always confuses simple terms, because it doesn't have real knowledge. And  because I never phrase my commands correctly, there's always confusion. All that being said, since I started using chatgpt my assignments still got better. How come they got better even thought it's bad at writing assignments the way I need it to ? Because I can read a text that's wrong and correct it. This way, I gain time by not having time to write things that I already master, and all my time can be used to research all those little inconsistencies which give me those feelings of doubt. Every time I read something and I get a little suspicious as to it's exactitude, I look it up in the recommended reading, and I end up learning more than I probably would have by writing about the subject myself. And I get a better grade. 

The thing that strikes me is that even though I admit that I put in a lot of work into my assignments, I still have a feeling of guilt about using it. And I'm not sure if what I'm doing is cheating or simply impostor syndrome. All my exams are still closed book, as you said you like them, and I pass them, so surely I must be learning something. Adding oral exams would help reinforce my confidence in my knowledge further.

In the end, the ability to write a better assignment will not make me a better clinician, but the ability to express my thoughts correctly in a structured manner will. But what comes first is my knowledge of theory.
