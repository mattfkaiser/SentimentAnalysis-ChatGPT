Cheaters will always find a way to cheat. I have a friend who I'm pretty sure cheated his way through most of the grad school we attended together. He passed all the classes but when the time came for him to do his boards he failed them multiple times before finally passing and was on the fringe of not being able to take the exam anymore. He had to basically relearn everything and study his ass off to compensate for his actions. 

If people are gonna use AI to skip past learning the skills that will enable them to be successful later in life, then ideally the education system should be catch them when examinations come into play where they're unable to use ChatGPT, Google, etc.
