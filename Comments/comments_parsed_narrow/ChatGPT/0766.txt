This is not true from my experience. Today I tried to make it fox a simple Python error and it kept just being plain wrong or unhelpful. I’ve tried it with similar things before and it has no issues giving me exactly what I needed.

The error was to do with async and it was something along the lines of this:

await func(var1, var2)

It said because the function was not in an async function I needed to move it. So it made the following:

async def func_caller(var1, var2)
    await func(var1, var2)

await func_caller(var1, var2)

It didn’t fix the issue at all it just moved it around. Previously it could fix issues like this pretty consistently.

But that’s not the worst part. Misunderstanding an issue is fine, the issue comes to correcting it. I explain what’s wrong and then it doesn’t fix anything.

For example I had a function having issues with the input parameters. The function was something like func(bot, inter). I asked it for help on an error, and it just removed inter, to make it func(bot).

I told it I still need to access inter somehow. So it added back inter, giving me the exact same code I started with and saying “this should fix it”

Originally chat GPT would have kept in mind that something was tried already
