People who aren't using chatgpt straight up don't understand it. I'd assume they are the same people who can't use Google to problem solve. 

I have regained a love for my profession due to chatgpt. I'm a  software engineer - I now have the ability to program virtually anything I can think of with ease. True, chatgpt makes some truly stupid decisions at times.. but if you have some idea what you're doing and remember to double check its suggestions, the gain in productivity is staggering.
