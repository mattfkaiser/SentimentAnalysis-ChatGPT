That is irrelevant. ChatGPT doesn’t need a lawyer to “represent” it.

Not being a lawyer myself, I cannot judge how good or bad ChatGPT-4 is in helping to self-represent. Two things are certain: it is basically free and it knows stuff. Therefore, it is highly likely many smaller cases that now are not litigated by not wealthy people because of the high costs of representation, will be litigated with the help of ChatGPT. In particular those that are decided by the judge, or settled and do not go to a jury trial.

More than that, I am positive that smartest lawyers **already** use ChatGPT for case studies, relevant code searches and opinion writing.
