I've recently read some blog post about ChatGPT capabilities. The author, a practicing pediatrician, said, that from his experience, the advice of ChatGPT may be worse than the advice of proven professional (someone, who has good recommendations, already knows you well and you have good experience working with, like maybe a doctor seeing you for a long time), but is on the same level or better, as the advice of some random specialist that gets assigned to you. I think your case just proves this point.

I've been in therapy for three years, currently I'm not seeing a psychologist on a regular basis. I'm regularly asking ChatGPT psychology advice, and it gives useful answers, which I can apply in practice. It also helped me in some difficult situations, for example with anxiety attacks, as sometimes what I need is just reassurance and non-judgmental reminder about simple things (self-care, deep breaths or something like that). It also helps to get an "outsider's view" on the situation.

Here is how I see an ideal scenario. When I was seeing a therapist, it was often a problem, that in the course of a week, I have a ton of small problems pile up, and I feel like I have to clear them first, before we can move on to something 'bigger', like deeper problems, and it was slowing down my progress. I would really like to have an opportunity to dump all those small problems on ChatGPT, as it is capable on giving useful advice, reserving an expensive hour of therapy for more in-depth things.
