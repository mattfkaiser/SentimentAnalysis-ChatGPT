"After I started using GPT-4, I'm pretty sure I've doubled my efficiency at work."

Lol, I mean... this may be why your colleagues don't want ChatGPT. They might like all having jobs.

edit: as a follow up, from a managerial perspective, if I heard an employee doubled his efficiency at work, I think two things: find out what he's doing, and, who can I fire now. Just being real. I have bosses above me too.
