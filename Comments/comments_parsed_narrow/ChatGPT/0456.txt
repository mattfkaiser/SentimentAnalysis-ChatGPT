Sorry for your loss, sir.

It was a very clever use  of chat gpt.

Today, it helped me find a TV episode my autistic daughter was looking for but has trouble verbilizing.

It was very helpful, you should edit the main post with a donation link. I'm sure a lot of ppl here would love to contribute some money to help put your mother to rest. 

Regards, 

Donovan
