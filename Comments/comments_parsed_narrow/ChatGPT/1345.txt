However, to be good at google searching, you need to know usually some keywords and build concise queries. With gpt I can just mumble what I think and it will do that part for me.

You're right, one advantage of interacting with AI like ChatGPT is that you can provide detailed and ambiguous descriptions of what you're looking for. Unlike traditional Google searches where concise queries with specific keywords are often needed, with AI you can express your thoughts more freely and let it generate relevant information or suggest keywords that can aid in a more targeted Google search.
