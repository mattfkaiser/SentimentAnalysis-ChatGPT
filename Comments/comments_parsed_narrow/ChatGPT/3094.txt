This is actually an interesting philosophical discussion: what is intelligence, really? ChatGPT is trained to output things that sound good, and sure, if that gives you the right answer most of the time that seems like intelligence. But a calculator also outputs correct answers and we wouldn’t call that intelligence. So I wouldn’t call ChatGPT intelligent, even for narrow applications.
