Feels faster than Googling, where the the first three links are Sponsored, and two links after that have weird addresses like fliki.imyfon.ae, and then the huge Related Searches/ People Also Search For list that's full of bullshit sometimes and before you know it you're at the bottom of the page, and you know that Page 2 of search is full of even more bullshit...
