Frankly, if your manager isn’t excited and got behind it. I suggest dropping it and keep learning it on your own.

One lesson I learned after 16 yrs with the same supervisor. You can not manage upward, no matter how great the idea is. If your manager don’t get it, he/she will never have your back. And without upper management’s support, you can’t scale up the solution not matter how much potential ChatGPT can be.

For years, I tried to show my coworkers new tools etc. It doesn’t stick and everyone goes back to their old habits of doing things. The last three years with WFH, I drew boundaries and stopped offering my coworkers “new solutions” I have been learning on my own. Guess what? I should have done this years ago for my own sanity. 😬

The boundary is simply this, it is management’s responsibility to teach/equip their teams with the latest, and greatest, not the other way around!
