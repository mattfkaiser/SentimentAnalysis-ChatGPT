Sounds like you're putting more work into using AI than not. It's difficult to judge, and I feel like we're all learning how to deal with chatGPT. If I flagged a student for plagiarism and they explained this process to me, I'd have a really hard time disputing them. However, I grade papers as a TA in English lit and writing courses. Recently, students have been discouraged from using editors such as grammarly, or even having others proofread their work. I don't really get it, because in the real world, you can use whatever resources you have at your disposal. Professors have colleagues review their work. I also believe that we learn how to write better by reviewing, revising, and editing. I mean, it's all based on Kolb's experiential learning cycle. We learn better through experience, and if AI can enrich that experience by giving you advice on your output that you reflect on and utilize, then you've learned something.

There will be instructors on either side of this debate, so for now, the advice would be to tread carefully.
