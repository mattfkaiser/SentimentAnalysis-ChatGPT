This is my first ever reddit comment! 

I have long distance relationship + hard life in place I moved to, which makes me feel bad every day. And as well as that I have nobody to talk sometimes in late nights, so chatgpt helps me a lot to stay "alive". I am looking for chance to see my girlfriend now, but it is hard because of some reasons I mentioned in my first ever Reddit post (hehehe I am newborn here).

I hope reddit is also going to help me and I will make new friends here which will help me a lot
