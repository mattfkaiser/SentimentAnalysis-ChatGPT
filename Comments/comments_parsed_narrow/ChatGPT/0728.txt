With absolutely no programming experience I needed a program to automate a regular task for me, specifically writing text onto images and saving it for me.

I now have a Python program installed that does exactly what I need it to do.

That said, ChatGPT screwed it up multiple times, and each time I asked it to fix it, at least initially, it spewed out entirely different ways of doing the program, until I learned to feed it back in the original program to fix, which in fairness it did.

All I needed it to do was add three blocks of text to the images, based on input from an excel file.

Turns out if I knew even the slightest bit about programming I would have understood what it was saying. As I didn't it took forever.

If I had known anything about programming it would have been a waste of time anyway because it would have been quicker to do it manually.

In short, ChatGPT is an interesting thing right now, and sure you can ask it quick questions and it will likely give a relatively okay answer to a programming issue. But it's not going to be writing things itself properly any time soon.
