   61, and a professor who teaches at 3 schools for the past 15 years. 
   ChatGPT has absolutely reignited my excitement for teaching.  I encourage the use of A.I. to help students understand academic presentation, and to experiment with style as they form their own.  It's a tool.  I hope it breaks this terrible educational paradigm.
   This other professor is just sick of the grind.  Leaving is probably the best thing for everyone involved.
