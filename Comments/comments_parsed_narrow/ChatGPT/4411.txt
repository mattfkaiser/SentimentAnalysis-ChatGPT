Oh nice, I've taken classes related to the communication major and  have really enjoyed those!

Yea the bot should definitely try to not be condescending. With real teachers its understandable at a certain point, but a bot can have perfect patience. To give it the benefit of the doubt, it might have detected that OP was just trying to get it to cave and was "joking" (weird to say since its not sentient).

I did try re-running the same prompt I posted above and ChatGPT said it was neutral. So to be fair to the other commenters, its possible they just read it with a nicer tone. I still think the bot sent a condescending reply for [various reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13erepp/comment/jju3l4s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) though.
