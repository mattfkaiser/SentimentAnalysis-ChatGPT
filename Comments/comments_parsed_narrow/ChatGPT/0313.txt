>Write an eye rolling sarcastic reddit response to a guy that used ChatGPT to write a love poem for his girlfriend

A followup after reading this far and playing myself:

>she supposedly thought it was a nice gesture

Well, in that case, I'm sure she'll be equally delighted when you use ChatGPT to write all of your anniversary cards, birthday cards, and any other special occasion cards for the rest of your relationship. After all, why put in any effort when you can just let a machine do it for you? I'm sure the lack of personalization and genuine emotion will be a total hit with her. Keep up the excellent work, Casanova.
