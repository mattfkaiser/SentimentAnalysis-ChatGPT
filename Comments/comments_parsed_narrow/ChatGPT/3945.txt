Probably not many. Most people who have built a career in writing enjoy it. Turning that over to a machine isn't, well, fun. I know I don't want ChatGPT to do my writing for me. 

With that said, I WOULD use ChatGPT to help me structure a story, or maybe prompt me to help me get over a stretch of writer's block. But I don't want ChatGPT to do everything because then what am I doing?
