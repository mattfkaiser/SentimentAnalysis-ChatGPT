ChatGPT is a very useful tool, but it shouldn't be used in meaningful relationships. Honestly, I'd immediately block contact with anyone that used that shit on me online. This isn't the first time I've seen this and it pisses me off to no end that some people think it's funny or doesn't make a difference to fool someone's feelings while hiding behind an AI.
