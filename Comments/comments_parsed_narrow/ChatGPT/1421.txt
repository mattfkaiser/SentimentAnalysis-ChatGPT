I taught chatgpt the correct process to spell a word backwards through a series of prompts, then asked it to spell lollipop backwards and it did so correctly. Prompts were:

Break the word lollipop into its individual letters in the order they appear in the word.

Now reverse those letters.

That is the correct process to spell a word backwards. 

Can you spell lollipop backwards now?
