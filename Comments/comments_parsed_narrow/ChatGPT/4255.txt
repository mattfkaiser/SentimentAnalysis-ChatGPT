>It just says like sorry but I am not a cook.

Yup. It's an *Assistant* cook for you: the Chef. At least that was the intended idea behind chatGPT to begin with...so to speak.

"Cook Assistants provide support to Chefs and perform tasks such as **peeling vegetables and fruits, cutting food portions, tasting dishes, and ordering supplies**."

You wouldn't ask your "cook assistant" to come up with elaborate menu themes as that is what is *your* knowledge is for as the Chef. But you would ask it, for example, to take template code for *one* menu theme you've written up and ask it to generate some variants, you might end up with some useful ideas or even something usable.

Or are you talking about actual food menus? I assume you mean menu designs for an app or website.  Even as a native English speaker, it's difficult to parse English idioms without a tone of voice and then give an accurate response. chatGPT will always have that problem.
