The number of ppl dissing you and your success is ridiculous. I'm getting a lot of jealousy vibes from people who just don't want to do the work, which is sad when it comes to something as revolutionary as ChatGPT.

Sounds like you learned how to leverage a new technology to help improve your life, and that is what it is all about. Congratulations on graduating!
