My heart goes out to you. If it felt supportive and cathartic for you then you don’t have to worry about finding a tool to process a little differently through chatgpt. My mother died one year ago and I have voicemails saved. I play them back just to hear her voice. I see something that reminds me of her, sometimes randomly, and I will stop what I am doing to think about her. Sometimes, I will have an experience or hear news that I would normally talk about with one of my parents, and imagine the conversation we had or what they might say. I see no difference with the lovely way you thought to feel connected to her. And so soon after, you almost can do no wrong, aside from self-harm or coping with drugs or alcohol. It’s a process.
