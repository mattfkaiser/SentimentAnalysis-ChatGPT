I'd say GPT4 is a limited use weapon, in ChatGPT GPT4 mode there is a 25-message limit over 3 hours, which is daunting when working on real projects (whatever that means to each of us); I find that generally 3.5 is great for brainstorming.

I find the same with the APIs, GPT4 is brought in only when a 3.5 prompt is made the best I can, no point in bringing a Patriot Missile to a fencing match.
