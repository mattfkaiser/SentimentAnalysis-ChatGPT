I just copied your advice but change the prompts so I now have access to an on-demand tutor for my upcoming hydrodynamics exam. It’s given me a study schedule and everything! I’ve used chatGPT loads this semester and it’s been a huge help, but this should make it even more useful as sometimes it gets way too confused by what I’m asking! Thank you for this!
