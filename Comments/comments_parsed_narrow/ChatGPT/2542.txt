Here's a few things I noticed:

1. It didn't mention LGBTQ+ rights in the first response, and in the second it only lists LGBTQ+ among a lists of other groups.
2. It doesn't mention anything about reproductive rights. (Note: GPT's data cuts off before Roe v. Wade was repealed.)
3. It doesn't directly mention Islamophobia, anti-Semitism or the role of certain politicians in encouraging white nationalism.

Overall, GPT seems to want to avoid the most controversial social issues and focus on issues that are either supported by scientific evidence or have some bipartisan support.

So, no, ChatGPT is not trying to brainwash your grandkids into becoming woke and joining Antifa. Calm down.
