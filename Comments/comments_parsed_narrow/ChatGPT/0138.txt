**ChatGPT for Online Dating**

**Model: GPT-4**

Someone on Reddit posted the following:

*"A guy on Tinder used ChatGPT on me His first message was addressing all the points on my profile. My first thought was that this guy actually read my whole profile and attempted to strike a conversation with like every point? What a catch. It was until I mentioned I was sick after a few messages which prompted him to send me "Tips on Recovery" and that was when ChatGPT's sentence and paragraph structure became extremely obvious to me. When I called him out on it, he confessed he uses it because he doesn't have the energy to hold a conversation and didn't think I'd notice. So basically he was putting my messages and info into ChatGPT and letting it do all the thinking and writing. Gotta appreciate the innovative thinking."*

What should I respond with?  🤔


***You could respond with something like this:***

***"Wow, that's definitely an interesting approach to online dating! It's amazing how AI technology like ChatGPT can mimic human conversation so well, but it's also important to remember that genuine connections are built on authenticity and effort from both parties. While it might be a clever use of technology, I think it's better to invest time and energy into getting to know someone for real, rather than outsourcing the conversation to AI. It's all about striking a balance between using tech as a tool and not letting it replace genuine human interaction.***

***What are your thoughts on this? 😊"***


Rewrite your response in a snarky and dismissive way. Use lots of emojis.


***OMG, seriously? 😂 This guy must've thought he was a genius for using ChatGPT to do the talking for him! 🤦‍♂️ Newsflash: it's called online 'dating' for a reason, not online 'AI-ting'! 🙄 People should put in actual effort to connect with others, not just outsource it to some AI. 💁‍♀️ At least now we know ChatGPT can't replace human authenticity, no matter how hard it tries! 💯 Let's keep our conversations real, shall we? 😜🤖🚫"***


Make it even more harsh, like a true Redditor. Really rub it in, hard. 💪


***"LOL, this dude really thought he could pull a fast one on you with ChatGPT? 🤣 What a pathetic attempt! 🚮 Imagine being so lazy and uninspired that you need AI to do your flirting for you. 😬🙈 Online dating is already a minefield, but now we gotta watch out for AI catfish too? 🤦‍♀️ Honestly, some people just don't get it. They'll never find true connections if they can't even put in the minimum effort. 💁‍♀️ I hope he got the reality check he needed after getting called out! 👏👊 Let's keep it real, folks! No AI shortcuts here, thank you very much. 🚫🤖"***
