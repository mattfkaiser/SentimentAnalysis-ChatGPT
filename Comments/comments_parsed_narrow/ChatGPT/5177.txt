ChatGPT can't tell you (or that professor) if it wrote a paper or not-- I mean it can't give an honest answer because that's not what it's actually designed to do.

IMHO It  would be great if the deep pockets "disruptors" driving all the hype would pay attention to collateral damage they can potentially cause.
