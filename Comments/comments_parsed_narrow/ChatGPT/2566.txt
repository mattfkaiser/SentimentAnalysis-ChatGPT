Exactly, this is a great point. I use ChatGPT to create scaffolding for code I would like to write. It provides structure, ideas to get my juices flowing, and sometimes/usually it "works" - but there is so much more to it than getting code to "work." There is nuance and context in the entire system I am working with. I'd never just blindly copy/paste. 

A screenwriter could ask ChatGPT, "I need a scene that introduces the protagonist to their eventual love interest early in a casual/light interaction." Then ChatGPT gives some scaffolding to 10 possible scenes. The screenwriter picks a couple and iterates. The setting of the scene isn't that important, but the dialogue is. So he/she can spend 99% of their mental energy on the dialogue, hopefully producing a much higher quality and interesting scene. Maybe it sparks other story ideas too.
