I gotta say I’ve really been digging Quora’s Poe.com. You can access Claude there, vs. a waitlist on Anthropic’s official site, and I’ve found it to be pretty underrated - in my experience it’s slightly better than 3.5, especially when it comes to discussions. Haven’t tested it for coding, but you can always access ChatGPT 3.5 from that site, too. And another really cool feature the site has is “build a bot”, which takes like 2 seconds and allows you to set the system prompt, which in recent weeks feels noticeably “stickier” than any user prompt or “jailbreak” has ever felt on chat.openai.com. Probably sound like a shill rn but I’ve just been really impressed with the results
