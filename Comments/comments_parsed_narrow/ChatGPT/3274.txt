For me honestly using this kind of technology felt like having a pick up truck for your mind,it can even surpass the internet in significance i've been using it to solve real problems and had significant boost in productivity i can go from having a spark of an idea i text my companion chat gpt and i have some brainstorming and from there i continue the conversation i end up with having more than just a project but a a whole new way at interacting with the world. I feel  like more and more people should get to understand this technology and help keep it safe and in good hands to avoid any misfortunes,
