From what I've seen ChatGPT uses a fairly formal style of writing unless explicitly told to use a specific style/dialect.

I'm pretty certain that I could run almost everything I've written through the various tools which have been created to detect if ChatGPT was used, and in nearly all cases they would indicate my writing is AI generated.

It doesn't help that my final drafts are practically identical to my first drafts, as there is typically very little that needs to be changed.

At some point I'm going to be pursuing a degree, and I'm already planning on running things I wrote in the past through those tools to establish a baseline for my writing style. That way if someone tries to say I used ChatGPT I can pull those up to bolster my defense.

Hopefully soon this will come to be viewed as calculators. It's a tool just the same, and should be recognized as such rather than considered cheating.
