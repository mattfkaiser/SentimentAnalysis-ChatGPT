Chat GPT actually opens up a lot more room for analysis of what good writing is and the skills of editing.  These are already skills that English teaches, but it often has to work around the abilities of students to write at all.

For example, when should a writer compound clauses and when should a writer use two independent clauses?  Some kids get stuck writing sentences that are lots of concatenated independent clauses, which is an issue. Other students only write simple  sentences with single clauses.  Asking Chat GPT to write both gives a chance to compare and for a student to analyze why a mix of both is important.

Adjectives and adverbs are great, but there’s also an art in picking the correct ones and the correct number. Again, a teacher can have an AI generate multiple descriptions of a scene for a class to compare and contrast.

There’s also tone elements that you can get out of writing from word choice alone, which is something that current AI can struggle with sometimes.  It’s also an issue with written text in the modern age, though, since communicating tone via email or text post is an important skill. That skill isn’t one that’s taught well in school, though, because there’s a lot of time spent doing the writing instead of analyzing already written words.
