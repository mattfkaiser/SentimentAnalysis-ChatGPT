I asked ChatGPT to write a script for a movie about a bunch of writers who are on strike because they are worried about AI taking their jobs. Here are some possible titles:

1. "Scriptocalypse: The Writers' Strike Back"
2. "Artificial Authors: The Last Stand"
3. "Blockbuster Rebellion: The Battle for Tinseltown"
4. "Hollywood Hijinks: The AI Uprising"
5. "Wordsmith Warriors: The Fight for Creativity"
