I think the answer lies within your intentions.

Do you want it to shit out a speech because you can't be bothered, or because you want it the best you can make it? I think your fine, it's no less ethical than asking someone for help/advise. You know, most people when writing something like that, will already base it on other speeches they've heard or looked up for inspiration, which is basically the same but slower process.

Just workshop it a bit with ChatGPT until it is what you want it to be. That way your "intentions" are still captured in the text no matter who formulated it.
