I think most people here don’t have a full understanding of AI.

Cause this detector worked - it basically said “yeah this is not original work”. 

Honestly this post basically reads like the kid did use chat GPT to cheat and he’s trying to come up with ways to weasel out of it. 

If he has a detector, he can put his own paper in and see what it says. Seems like the easiest solution.
