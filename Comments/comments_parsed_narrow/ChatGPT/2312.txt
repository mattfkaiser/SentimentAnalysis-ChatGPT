It's awesome that you find it a big help!

I think people worrying a bit is not surprising, since ChatGPT is a language model that sends you text as a jigsaw, it doesn't actually understand anything we input, or it "says". So sometimes, it might output text that is harmful and/or blatantly wrong. This is the reason for caution. Sometimes it makes a lot of sense, because we're lucky enough that it's sampling text written by people who knew what they were talking about. Other times, it's complete nonsense (but may still seem to make sense - we humans are good at seeing patterns that aren't there, and filling in the blanks).

Personally, though, I think it makes perfect sense for you to continue if it's a big help to you. It's not like no mental health professional will ever tell you blatantly wrong things. Of course yes, ChatGPT will never be as good as a mental health professional for several reasons, including the above and the part that human to human connection is a really crucial part of healing. But ChatGPT is free and available 24/7. So as long as it's helpful, why not? The advice of seeking professional help is good, but if that's not going to happen anyway, for whatever reason, then why not?

And definitely, ChatGPT instead of dubious coping strategies (say for example, drinking or smoking) should be a big upgrade.
