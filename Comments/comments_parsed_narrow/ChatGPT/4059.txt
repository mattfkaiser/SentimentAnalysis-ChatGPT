Work in IT at a law firm. We look for any tech advantage we can BUT we fear being the first. Note that I don't and am all for change most of the time but lawyers can be disbarred. So that tends to make them more conservative.

That said we are testing internal apps, providers like LexisNexis are building out their own infrastructure and apps (even though they'll inevitably suck), there's smaller companies like Casetext building things, [Above The Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/attorney-ai-assistants-gpt-driven-tools-and-browser-extensions-to-streamline-your-work/) mentioned some of the things that have come out last couple months. This sort of tool is 100% something our attorneys will want in some capacity.

One more thing: The MO of law firms is to turn a profit however they can. That's usually by either increasing hours, increasing hourly rates, or... well that's their main approaches. Some things are flat cost but those are generally handled by non attorneys at the firm.  But one thing they also do from time to time is cut costs and AI makes a lot of things that are handled by paralegals and secretaries automatic. So instead of having 1 secretary per 4 attorneys, they can have it at 1 per 6. And they won't do it via firing people, but when Betty leaves maybe we just spread out her attorneys. We're already on the train to phasing out certain jobs at law firms long term via tech. ChatGPT and similar tech isn't going to be it, but it'll help move that needle.
