Go to [https://chatbot.theb.ai/](https://rammerhead.org/), it's just ChatGPT but on a different website, AND you don't need an account to use it. Bing also has built-in GPT abilities, it's only rolled out for some people though.

Tip: If you want to go to any website without them being able to see it, use [https://rammerhead.org/](https://rammerhead.org/), it's a proxy browser.
