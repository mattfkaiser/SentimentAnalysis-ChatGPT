Usually I am worn down from work on Fridays. If somebody sends me the wrong email I used be really pissed of about the situation and write the most aggressive response. Now I still write that email as harsh and as insulting as I possibly can. I then copy paste it into ChatGPT and ask it write it as nicely and polite as it possibly can. I then send a slightly edited version of what ChatGPT suggests and everyone has a better weekend.
