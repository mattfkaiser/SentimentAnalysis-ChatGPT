I have tried Open Assistant this morning, which made me realize chatgpt is going to be one of those first movers that fail to become leaders of the industry.

Not that Open Assistant is any better, far from it, but it made me realize something new and probably better will pop up sometime in the future. 

Especially at this rate where everyday chatgpt is becoming more useless.
