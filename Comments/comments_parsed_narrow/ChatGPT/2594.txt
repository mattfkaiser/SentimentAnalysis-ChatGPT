I think the abstract thought that goes into crafting a narrative will be among the harder human tasks for AI to master and two years isn't a very realistic timeframe to replace screenwriters. It's much more straightforward in content writing to feed it a dataset of all the articles in the world, make predictions based on the most common patterns, and produce writing that's generally accurate and relevant to the topic.

With stories, the most common patterns are tropes and cliches. Try using ChatGPT just to write poetry and it's impossible to get it away from very basic AABB rhyming because that's what the average poem looks like. It takes a much more nuanced understanding of the audience and the medium and the types of stories and styles people are right now interested in to be able to conjure the novel elements that make new movies so entertaining rather that just rewatching what we've already seen.
