GPT-4's response (I told it to be concise): 

AI like ChatGPT isn't replacing jobs yet due to its limitations in understanding, adaptability, ethical and legal concerns, integration challenges, and trust issues. The tipping point for widespread AI adoption is hard to predict. AI is more likely to augment rather than replace human labor. Big tech companies invest in AI, but mass layoffs due to AI are not yet a reality.
