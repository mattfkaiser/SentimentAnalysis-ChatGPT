ChatGPT is nowhere near as good as casual users make it out to be. Once you use it a few times, you'll run into its repetitiveness and limitations. Even ChatGPT-4 will not surprise you with its abilities.

It *is* very good at taking shortcuts to output *something*. It's like spitting out a C+ essay. But it's not going to produce quality and creativity. So for situations where it doesn't require uniqueness and creativity, it's very good. But that's the limitation.

Users should stop being surprised when it does dumb things that it isn't designed to do.
