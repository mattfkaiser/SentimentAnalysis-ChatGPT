Lmao you cant prove that somebody used AI. Surely there are people that don't hide it at all and leave mistakes and certain key phrases in, which makes it obvious. But if you use AI for help and change sentences etc. there is literally no way to prove anything. Even if CHATGPT claims something if it is not totally obvious you are still human and GPT is not.
