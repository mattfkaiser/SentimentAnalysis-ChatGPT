I am seeing some people responding with 

“I asked ChatGPT about xyz and this was the response.”

I think the big fear is we as humans forget how to think and learn to solve problems for ourselves.

Already we can find a youtube video to guide us to do something. No more tinkering and finding out for ourselves.

There are also some studies done that highlighted how our intelligence since World War 2 has dropped.

Overall we lost IQ points since the victorian age.
