.. i mean the burden of proof is literally on the professor making the serious accusation. It's ridiculous to assume a student would have to prove that they didn't use it. None of this even matters because until there is a reliable way to detect it, professors would be opening themselves up to litigation by failing a student for it. "knowing the material" is not even a defense, tbh. It doesn't negate anything about the fact that you could have used chatgpt to write the paper itself. The only thing that matters here is evidence that would hold up in court. Either a very high similarity rating to other users in the class also suspected of using chatgpt or a far more advanced detection system.
