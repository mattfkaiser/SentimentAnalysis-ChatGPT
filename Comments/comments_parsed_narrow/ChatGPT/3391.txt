>Why do people keep saying this? Anything at the level of a university level math course, and a calculator is kinda useless beyond the most trivial arithmetic operations. 

Clearly you haven't taken university level math courses

>For the fancier calculators that can do integrals, guess what, the university screens your calculator to make sure it is not one of those calculators, OR they have a selection of calculators that you must choose from in order to complete the exam.

Yess it's just a discrete jump - calculators either are only capable of doing basic arithmetic, or they're capable of integration. There's surely nothing between those two extremes, no features that save time or do things for you. That's ridiculous. 

Oh yeahh, every university screens sooo well for calculators. Every single test or exam they make sure to go around all 300 calc 2 students and check every single feature of their calculator out! That happens, totally. 

>For all these people using chatgpt, all I can say is, what are you going to do during the in person pen and paper exam where no internet is required and you don't have a deep understanding of the subject matter nor any practice with the art of essay writing.

Study and pass the exam like usual except with hours and hours more time to work efficiently with a ai that can help with studying and critique work? You don't need to do bullshit tasks made up by a person who doesn't respect your time in order to get a deep understanding of a subject matter. Chatgpt does a great job giving practice prompts and practice questions. The teacher is useless, they are only an obstacle. 

>The professor is going to know which students used chatgpt to cheat and which students didn't pretty quickly. 


Lol people like you who religiously do all the assignments and tests just NEED to feel that it was all meaningful. It's not even about assessing how much you know, it's about protecting your ego. It'd hurt too much for you to realize you wasted all that time and energy for literally nothing and you could have done everything you did in half the time without the stress.
