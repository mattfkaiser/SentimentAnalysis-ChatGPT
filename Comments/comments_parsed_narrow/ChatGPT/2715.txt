I think it's exaggeration to say it can communicate as well as a human. I don't think you could really say ChatGPT has social intelligence above like a Kindergartener or a really smart animal like a dolphin. But a low level of social intelligence is still **a level** of social intelligence, and that's the part that's revolutionary.
