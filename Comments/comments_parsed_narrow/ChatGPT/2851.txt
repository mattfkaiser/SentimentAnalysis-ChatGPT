Im like super duper happy to give you some general ideas on how to tell if a document might have been written by a GPT-like AI, you know, like ChatGPT, when I trained up until 2021.

So, like, one thing to look out for is long and fancy sentences. GPT models, including ChatGPT, tend to make sentences all complex and stuff, which can make them sound too serious or smart, especially compared to how us high schoolers write. It's not always a dead giveaway, but it could be a clue.

Oh, and AIs love to use the same phrases over and over again. Like, they'll say "essentially," "moreover," or "furthermore" way too much. It's kinda weird, you know?

Another thing is that AI doesn't have personal experiences or feelings. So if the essay sounds all distant and doesn't have any real personal stories or thoughts, it could be written by AI. It's like missing a personal touch or something.

AI can also get all mixed up sometimes. They don't remember stuff from one time to another, so they might change their style or tone or even say things that don't make sense. It's like they're not always consistent.

Oh, and AI loves to use fancy words to sound uncertain. They'll say stuff like "It seems that," "It's possible that," or "You could argue that" a lot more than a regular person.

Sometimes AI can repeat things too. They might say the same ideas or phrases again and again, just in a slightly different way.

AI struggles with certain prompts, you know? Like, if you asked them to make rhyming poetry or be funny, they might mess up. So if the assignment was something like that and it's all wrong, it's probably AI.

If the essay has, like, crazy detailed information on a bunch of topics, it could be AI. I mean, we can look stuff up, but if it's way too much knowledge, it's suspicious.

AI doesn't like taking sides on controversial stuff. So if the essay doesn't have a clear opinion when it should, it's probably AI.

And get this, AI is like perfect at spelling and grammar. Most of us make mistakes, but if the essay doesn't have even one error, it might be AI.

But hey, don't rely only on these signs, okay? Some of them could apply to a really smart and hardworking student. It's not fair to think they cheated just because of that. Also, sometimes students use AI to get ideas or overcome writer's block, so the essay could still be mostly their own work.
