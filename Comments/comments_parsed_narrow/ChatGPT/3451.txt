Good.  Keep up or get out.  I just had a two hour conversation with my favourite instructor and she talked about how she was doing assignments using ChatGPT where she asks students to use it to do their prompt but then makes it a course exercise to go through and find the “bad” information in the returned product.  If a 60 year old can’t handle that the world is changing, they are absolutely doing the right thing by moving aside so they don’t hold back their students.
