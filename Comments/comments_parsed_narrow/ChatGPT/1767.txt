my eulogy to mine a few years was talking about good memories rather than the generic stuff. He was a funny and caring father to not just me but father figure to everyone who wasnt his father in my family and friends who didnt have a father. It ended up being like a stand up comedy routine and it really helped me open up to everyone doing a non-sad one because im super shy before and never talked. I reenacted some memories and made it extremely relatable for everyone. Now everyone remembers me from that funeral even those who didnt know me closely and loved it. 

I wouldnt use chatgpt honestly. If you really loved your father and he loved you he wouldnt even care how bad it was. At least you put your effort into it.
