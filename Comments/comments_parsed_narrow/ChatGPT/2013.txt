LOL, that's one perspective.

Mine is that ChatGPT was always dumb and the more people use it, the more they find out what a LLM is and how unreasonable their expectations are. People who realize that are not getting dumber but smarter. (which makes ChatGPT relatively dumber)

People the fail/refuse to understand what a LLM is and can do were and are 'dumb' but not getting dumber IMHO.
