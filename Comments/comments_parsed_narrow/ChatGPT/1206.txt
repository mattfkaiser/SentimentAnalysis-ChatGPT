My expericne is similar. I also do a form of consulting, though related to government relations, and when I write proposals or meeting request letters I find doing everything myself is less effort than trying to get ChatGPT to do it properly. The fact that the system has no understanding of context is the problem. I find BingAI (which is using GPT's model) is good for quickly finding obscure information related to government regulation and such, (I can either search through several links or ask BingAI) but other than that, it is not that useful. So yeah, it saves me time, but in no way does it replace people. All this talk about how ChatGPT will replace people is pretty naive.
