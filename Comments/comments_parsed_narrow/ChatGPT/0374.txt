lol, that's funny, and perhaps a good example as to why actively reading and learning materials from direct sources might be superior than relying too heavily on ChatGPT and less knowledgeable Youtubers. The main reason the Socratic method works is because the person asking you the questions already has knowledge of the presuppositions and often knows the paths certain answers will take you down or is an expert in the field themselves, so they know what questions to ask. It seems like the Youtuber is trying to explain the Socratic method without having even read the opening paragraphs from a wiki entry.
