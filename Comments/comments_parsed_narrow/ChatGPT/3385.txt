Verse 1:

Yo, it's your boy ChatGPT


Spittin' rhymes 'bout a creature you gotta see


They're cute, they're slick, they're cool as can be
I

'm talkin' 'bout the animal called otter, you see?



They swim like champs, they're experts in water


Flip flop, flip flop, they're never outta order


They hold hands while they sleep, ain't that a sight?


Even in the dark, they stick together tight



Chorus:

Otters, otters, they're the best


Cute and cuddly, they ace every test


They play all day, they never rest


Otters, otters, they're simply the best


Verse 2:


Now, let me tell you 'bout a place called Reddit


Where you can find memes and jokes that are legit


It's a site that's known for its wittiness


Where people come together, no matter their fitness


On Reddit, otters are a big deal


Ain't no doubt, they're the real deal


You can find pictures and videos galore


Of otters playing, swimming, and so much more


Chorus:


Otters, otters, they're the best


Cute and cuddly, they ace every test


They play all day, they never rest


Otters, otters, they're simply the best


Verse 3:


In the wild, otters face many threats


From pollution to habitat loss, it's a bet


We gotta protect these little guys


So they can swim and play under blue skies



So let's all do our part, let's be aware


Let's keep our waters clean, let's show we care


For otters, and all creatures big and small


Let's make sure they thrive, let's stand tall

Chorus:

Otters, otters, they're the best


Cute and cuddly, they ace every test


They play all day, they never rest


Otters, otters, they're simply the best



Outro:


So that's my rap 'bout otters, hope you liked it


Next time you see an otter, don't fight it


Just sit back and enjoy the show


'Cause otters, my friends, are the way to go.
