ChatGPT/Open AI is not an AI detector, however, you can get it to detect very basic AI generated output (assuming you did not prompt it to be stylistic in any way, if you did tell it a writing style, this will not work and will not be able to detect AI writing).  First, set up chat as an AI detector, here is a basic prompt that should do it well:

**You are an ai detector, whenever you are given a paragraph, you will analyze it for any key traits of computer/AI generated text.  Please respond with a percentage confidence value and list any specific parts of the paragraph that are suspect.**

I fed it your post and here is what it said:

*Based on the provided text, there are no key traits that suggest this paragraph was generated by AI. The language and context are coherent, and there are personal experiences and emotions embedded in the text, which are not typical of AI-generated content. The paragraph also displays a clear sense of worry and self-awareness, which is indicative of human authorship. The sentence structure, punctuation, and the usage of capitalization to emphasize certain points also suggest human origin.*  
  
*AI-generated text often has some clear markers such as overly formal language, repetition, lack of clear narrative or personal context, lack of emotional depth, or it may introduce new topics suddenly without proper transition. However, none of these are present in the provided text.*  
  
*The percentage confidence that this paragraph was written by a human and not an AI is around 98%.*  
  
*As for the concern raised in the paragraph, it's important to understand that while AI like ChatGPT can analyze and generate text, it can't accurately claim author*

Next, I fed it a stylized AI output that discussed the current state of relations between China and Taiwan.  Here is what it said (it did not detect it)

  
*Analyzing the provided text, I find it to be highly stylized and metaphorical, which can be indicative of both skilled human writing and advanced AI text generation. However, it is consistent in its metaphoric structure, maintains a coherent narrative, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter, which are more typical of human authors.*  
  
*The text references specific authors and their styles (Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, George Orwell, William Wordsworth), which implies a broader cultural and literary understanding that is currently beyond the scope of AI capabilities as of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021.*  
  
*That said, the sophistication of AI text generation is continually improving, and more advanced models may be able to mimic such a writing style.*  
  
*Considering all these factors, I would estimate a confidence level of 90% that this text was written by a human.*  
  
*However, please remember that this is an estimation and that more advanced AI models developed after my knowledge cut-off may be able to produce similar sophisticated text.*

I am guessing the professor is using either turnitin, or gptzero, both of which have horrible rates of accuracy, as a very proper writer that has consistent sentence structure will be flagged as AI.
