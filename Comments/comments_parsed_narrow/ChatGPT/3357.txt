Because the humanities have a different emphasis on the thinking process as compared to getting the right answer. Not that in STEM areas they don't care about both, but in many humanities courses its more important to ask questions and think through them, than it is to arrive at any one particular conclusion. I want to know what my students are thinking and why. I don't particularly care what view they end up subscribing to (within reason). In stuff like coding or math you need specific results. While coding has a certain art to it, at the end of the day if it's not done properly the program won't function. Or the equation won't work. Or the science experiment won't produce repeatable results. The outcomes in these cases are very important, and the thinking process is important primarily because you need a certain sort of thinking to produce the appropriate outcomes.

I can see answers to thinking prompts that are most likely ChatGPT prompted. They are "right" in the sense that they have produced something intelligible on the subject, but if my students didn't think and the answer came from a neural network rather than a human, it sort of defeats the core purposes of studying HUMANITIES. I don't want to cultivate a certain product or result at the end of their work, I want to cultivate humans who are capable of participating alongside other humans in the process of human flourishing. I don't want a computer answer on comparing Malcolm X and Martin Luther's works. I want students to grapple with the choices they made and why they made them, and how people responded to those choices so that they are prepared to face the social issues of their day.
