I’m an attorney.


If you actually understand the language ChatGPT is using, you’re not intimidated by it. ChatGPT consistently falls short of being acceptable in a legal context. It’s just not there yet.

Also, we’re a self-regulating profession. A group(s) of lawyers govern the legal profession and would (and have in the past) immediately shut down the use of chatbots in legal proceedings. 

When that guy in CA made a bot that could represent people disputing traffic tickets and attempted to appear in court, the Bar made clear that any attorney assisting him in that effort would be disbarred.
