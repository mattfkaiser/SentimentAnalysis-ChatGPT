My father just passed away 5 weeks ago. I used chat GPT to help write my speech for the funeral. It helped me so much during such a tough time. I asked it to interview me and help reflect on all the good times. It was very therapeutic for me and I'd definitely do it again. Obviously I still rewrote the speech many times after to suit me but it turned out great.
