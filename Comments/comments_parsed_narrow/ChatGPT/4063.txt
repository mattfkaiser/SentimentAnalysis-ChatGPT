You can simply tell it to write in a different style. Language, style, tone of voice is what it does best.

And it absolutely will replace journalists very soon. It already is right now.

I'm saying that as a journalist that has covered the topic of AI and is now starting to use it myself in my work and seeing the consequences already. ChatGPT cannot compete with the level of work that I can do. Not yet at least. But it already can do the most mundane short articles that I sometimes also do, in seconds. As of now I feed it with academic journal articles, abstracts and reports and tell it to either create a summary for me or even a finished article if I only need a very short news notice which I then edit and improve.

A few months ago, we could no longer afford to have an intern to write stuff like that and also summaries and short texts for SoMe and had to do it ourselves. My colleague recently remarked that ChatGPT writes better and needs less editing than our interns did. So that's one job already gone right there.

In the best of worlds I use ChatGPT to free up my time spent on unimportant small stuff like that so I can spend more time on the quality stuff that I do best. Higher quality. In a worse world it means one in four people get fired and we produce even more quantity. Realistically it's the second option since journalism is already in a horrible economic situation. Most of my team is getting fired next month and would be anyway. AI is speeding that up and those jobs in journalism are not coming back.
