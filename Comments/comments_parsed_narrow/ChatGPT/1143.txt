Doesn't even have to be a different prompt. 

I didn't use that specific site, but my brother told me there are tools online that detect thr use of ChatGPT. 

So I got it to write me something, pasted the answer into one of the checkers. Very high percentage 'AI' detected (not sure exactly but something like 80%) 

Regenerated the response. Pasted it in to same tool, much lower (like 20-25%) 'AI' detected. 

You're right, the  tools used to detect AI are bullshit
