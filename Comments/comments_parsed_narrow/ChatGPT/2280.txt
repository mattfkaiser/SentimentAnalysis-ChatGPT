I used 3.5. Even though I was telling it not to do something, it kept doing it. Definitely annoying! I ended up starting a new chat, and worded the prompt much differently. For example, I was writing something that I wanted to include some peer-viewed research. It just kept saying the same points of the research over and over again. I asked it not to repeat, but it kept doing so. So then I scrapped it and started a new chat to just talk about the topic with a prompt later to give me a list of peer reviewed papers with talking points. That worked better, though it seems chatgpt isn't really well versed with research since it didn't give much info. 

You could try leaving out the word "email" in the prompt. Maybe something like: "Please write a response to someone about xyz without pleasantries." -Or- "how can I tell someone about abc?" 

It might be something that the programmers need to adjust. I believe there is a thumbs up and down (or similar) next to the answer to give your feedback.
