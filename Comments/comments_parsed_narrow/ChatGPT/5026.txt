I experienced the same when looking for advice on certain software engineering technologies. There's so many articles out there that just contain a million filler words to force a higher rank in the search engine. So very often you have no chance of searching for something very particular, because there's a million articles that contain every tech word you can think of so those will always come up first. 

It's gonna be even easier now for website owners to create such articles en masse with the help of chatGPT.
