This is how I know it’s equivalent. 

When I was a kid and saw an advertisement for Prodigy in Time Magazine, I made my mom take me to Radio Shack the next day so I could see it myself. After that I talked about nothing else. I was obsessed with all the things it could potentially do and everyone in my family heard about it non-stop. 

Now I obsessively talk about AI with my kids and my co-workers: “You know, ChatGPT can do that for you.” And I think I am not at risk of being socially isolated again.
