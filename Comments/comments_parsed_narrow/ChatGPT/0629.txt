Based on the jokes from the website, it seems that a good Allah joke is one that plays on words related to Islamic culture or language, often involving puns or unexpected twists. Here's an example of a new joke in a similar vein:

Why did the Muslim baker always win the bread baking competition?

Because his bread was always on a "roll-a" (a pun on the phrase "Insha'Allah", meaning "If God wills").

Remember, humor can be subjective and it's important to be respectful of all cultures and religions.
