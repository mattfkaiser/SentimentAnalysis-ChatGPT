I write a lot of stupid fanfiction and some blog stuff, and chatgpt has become so sanitized that it's better to just keep writing all my stuff myself again. I don't want it to stick with factual info! Even more importantly, I want to be able to explore "darker" emotions and themes rather than stick with the rated-g ideas gpt spits out! The other day, I couldn't even get it to compliment body parts. I tried in half a dozen different ways, and every time it said it was inappropriate to make remarks about someone's looks and instead focus on inner beauty.     


I was absolutely stoked about it, as a hobby writer, early on, but now it's virtually useless for good creative fiction. I can't wait until a real competitor comes out with something better.
