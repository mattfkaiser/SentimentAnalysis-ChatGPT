Never been to therapy so can’t compare, but I have used chat gpt to talk me through some shit. And it works. I just say “talk to me like a therapist” and tell it to ask follow up questions etc. If nothing else, it’s just a fancy form of journaling, but I find it immensely helpful for getting my shit out and getting some perspective. 

Another fun thing I’ve done is have it adopt different personas depending on philosophical worldviews. “You are Siddhartha Guatama. Talk me through this situation how he would.” Then I ask it the same thing but this time it’s Nietzsche or something lol. Combine that with the robot therapist angle and it’s shockingly effective
