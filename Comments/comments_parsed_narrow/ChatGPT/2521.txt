Because of your post i tried ChatGPT for the first time. I asked for a new national anthem for the Netherlands. Its glorious. 

Verse 1:
Oh, land of windmills and tulips fair,
The Netherlands, our pride we bear,
Our hearts beat with love for thee,
A nation strong, united and free.

Chorus:
Hail to thee, our land of old,
Thy people brave, thy spirit bold,
May peace and freedom ever reign,
In our dear Netherlands again.

Verse 2:
From polders flat to hills up high,
Our land is blessed beneath the sky,
Where rivers flow and seas surround,
Our Dutch roots firmly in the ground.

Chorus:
Hail to thee, our land of old,
Thy people brave, thy spirit bold,
May peace and freedom ever reign,
In our dear Netherlands again.

Verse 3:
Through times of war and times of peace,
Our courage never seems to cease,
With steadfast hearts, we face each day,
And proudly live the Dutch way.

Chorus:
Hail to thee, our land of old,
Thy people brave, thy spirit bold,
May peace and freedom ever reign,
In our dear Netherlands again.

Verse 4:
Oh, let us sing with voices strong,
A joyful tribute to our land,
With grateful hearts we raise this song,
For Netherlands, forever grand.

Chorus:
Hail to thee, our land of old,
Thy people brave, thy spirit bold,
May peace and freedom ever reign,
In our dear Netherlands again.
