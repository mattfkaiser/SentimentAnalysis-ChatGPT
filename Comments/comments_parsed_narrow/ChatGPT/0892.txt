My programming knowledge ends at what a compiler is tbh. Iâ€™d just download some free C++ compiler, make my game in C++, and then copy paste it into the compiler and click compile. Ya know, after somehow importing the graphical elements into a library that I have no idea how it works. Though ChatGPT could probably help me through those steps. And tell me to stop being an idiot and thinking I know programming.
