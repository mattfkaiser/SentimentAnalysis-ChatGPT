There's a channel on YouTube called Catfished by Social Catfish. They help romance scams victims. After about the 3rd episode you realize all these scammers are following a play book and they share names once someone has shown they'll pay. Very sad. I'm wondering how long it'll be until their episodes mention ChatGPT.
