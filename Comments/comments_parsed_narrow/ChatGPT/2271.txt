I asked ChatGPT. Try these:



I apologize if there have been instances where I did not adhere to your request in previous conversations. As an AI language model, I don't have persistent memory of past interactions, and each conversation is treated as independent. Therefore, it's possible that your specific request may not carry over from one conversation to another.



To ensure consistent adherence to your request, here are a couple of workarounds/fail-safes you can implement:



1. Explicitly restate your request: In each conversation where you want to exclude well-wishes, make sure to reiterate your request clearly and directly. Even if you have made the request before, restating it explicitly within the context of the current conversation can help ensure it is not overlooked.



2. Use a template or preface your request: Consider using a template or preface at the beginning of your message that reminds me of your preference. For example, you can start your message with a line like:



   - "Please note: I kindly request that well-wishes are not included in this response."
   - "Template: Please exclude any well-wishes in the following response."



By using such techniques, you provide a constant reminder of your preference, increasing the likelihood that it will be followed.



3. Manually edit the response: If a well-wish is included in my response despite your request, you can simply delete or modify that part of the text before sending the message. This way, you can have direct control over the content and ensure it aligns with your requirements.



Please keep in mind that I am here to assist you, and I will do my best to accommodate your requests. However, as an AI, I may not always be perfect in adhering to your preferences. I appreciate your understanding and patience in such cases.
