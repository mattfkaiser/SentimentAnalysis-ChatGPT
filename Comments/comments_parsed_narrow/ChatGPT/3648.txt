For what it's worth, then, that you might lie and might do this or that *because* she is a person and not chatGPT is something to bring up to your psychologist, because that's something that probably does need to be addressed lol. no biggie though. Sometimes having opinions about your therapist is something for therapy itself. Sometimes being open with your therapist and choosing not to lie, and to be completely honest IS part of the work you need to do to benefit from therapy with *any* therapist.

What you've put down on reddit should be something you either show your psychologist or talk about with your psychologist, is all I'm saying. good luck anyhow
