>I frankly consider to have either not used it enough or not experimented enough with the right prompts

 Me. 

But here I am, trying to learn. I dont know what ChatGPT is, or how to effectively utilize it.   I understand the concept that it can write poems & stories. The thing that confuses me is when people say they are using it to run their business or automate things.  I need a step by step explaining it. Maybe I should ask Chatgpt? haha
