Considering how ChatGPT works, you should take anything it says with a grain of salt and also only use it as a supplement to an actual psychologist. Treat it as a random reddit comment ALL of the time, especially when challenging it. Also keep in mind that, when you challenge it, it will most often conform to your opinion/views - that might not be helpful in many situtations. Always keep in mind that its more a "Text generating calculator" than a super intelligent AI when talking about important stuff like that.
