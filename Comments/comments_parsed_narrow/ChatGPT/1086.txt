Bruh low key, CHAT GPT is a really good lawyer

I work for a Software company. While running a review campaign we had someone 0 star us for basically bogus reasons.

I asked chat to try a “strongly worded letter” to have the review removed and boy did it deliver 😳

I had to cut it down for length, but needless to say, the 0 star review was removed
