I think chatgpt is a wake up call for most of humanity that AI is coming and it’s coming way faster than most thought. 

I absolutely believe it’s the product of our generation. 

It will change absolutely everything, productivity should go through the roof and AI tools like this are going to improve humanity in the most dramatic ways we have ever seen. 

Can you even imagine being a child with this tool at your fingertips - having a teacher who is an expert in literally all subjects. Teachers will become pastoral care effectively. 

Music will be generated on the fly depending on your tastes, films will be generated for you instantly depending on your mood at the time.

Everything is going to come much faster, we will be able to concentrate on crucial things like fusion, fix the climate etc etc.
