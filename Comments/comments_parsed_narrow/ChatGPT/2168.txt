Make sure you don’t share private information about patients with chatgpt. This can affect your job heavily. Also I would not push hard your colleagues. You won’t change someone’s opinion if they are not ready. If they don’t think it’s useful enough the more you push the more they will resist. Take it easy and use it to get advantage over colleagues. Only than they may be interested.
