ChatGPT once tried to tell me you could get a 1967 Impala SS with the four-door body style (you couldn't) and that Master of Puppets wasn't the first thrash metal album to be certified Platinum by the RIAA (it demonstrably was, a simple search of the RIAA's own website would verify this)

In a nutshell, no; ChatGPT simply isn't a good tool for finding factual information
