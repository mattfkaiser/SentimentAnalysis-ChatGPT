I've tried that - I find the result far less convincing than its finished product. I'm sure it can be done, but it's more effort than just generating a finished version. And then you'd have to make sure that your finished version seems like a natural progression of the draft - it can't just be completely rewritten, which is probably what would happen if you ask ChatGPT to finish the job for you.
