Yes, and I couldn’t be happier. So sick of google and their crappy results. Enshitification is what happened to google search. They let garbage websites game their algorithm so all the top hits are junk. I’m not even talking about how the first five results are sponsored.

Somewhere I read that google was good in the beginning because it gave you the information you want. But over time, to make more money, they shifted to giving you the information they want us to have (so they can monetize us). 

Well, f you google, I’m out. ChatGPT answer my question, you don’t.

Ok I know I went on a rant there. I do still use Google sometimes. But much less.
