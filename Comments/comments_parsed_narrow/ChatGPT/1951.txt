I can definitely relate to what you're saying. I've been using ChatGPT for a few months now, and I've been really impressed with its ability to answer questions and generate text. I've found that it's much more helpful than Google search in a lot of cases, especially when I'm looking for information that is not easily found on the web.

For example, I recently had a question about a technical topic that I was working on. I tried searching for the answer on Google, but I couldn't find anything that was helpful. I then tried asking ChatGPT the question, and it was able to provide me with a detailed and informative answer in just a few minutes.

I've also found that ChatGPT is great for generating text. I've used it to write blog posts, articles, and even short stories. It's really helpful for getting my ideas down on paper, and it's always able to generate text that is clear, concise, and engaging.

Overall, I'm really impressed with ChatGPT. It's a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks. I highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for a more intelligent and helpful search engine.

Here are some of the pros and cons of using ChatGPT:

**Pros:**

* Can answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way.
* Can generate text that is clear, concise, and engaging.
* Is not influenced by paid rankings or sponsored content.
* Can provide contextual follow-ups and clarifications.
* Can dynamically rephrase to make sense at different levels of understanding.

**Cons:**

* Is still under development, so it may not be as accurate or reliable as Google search.
* Can be slow at times, especially when generating large amounts of text.
* May not be as useful for tasks that require a deep understanding of the world, such as research or critical thinking.

Overall, I think ChatGPT is a great tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way we search for information. It is still under development, but I am confident that it will continue to improve over time.
