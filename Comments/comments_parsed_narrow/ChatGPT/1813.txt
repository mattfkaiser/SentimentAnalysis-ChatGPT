While I understand where other people are coming from, because an eulogy is expected to be personal, I don’t think using ChatGPT would go against this. Just because it is written by a bot doesn’t mean it has to come out impersonal and denuded of all feelings. You can ask ChatGPT to write an eulogy for your dad and implementing what you’re feeling, memories with your dad, into the plot. You can ask it to improve it as many times as you want until you’re fully satisfied by asking it to put more emphasis on certain feelings for example. Grief is a difficult time, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and it’s okay to ask for help, even if that help is ChatGPT. I also understand that you would want to do justice and honour the person your father was in the most perfect way possible. What you’re going through is incredibly difficult, so do whatever makes this process easier for you. Sending love and light to you and your family.
