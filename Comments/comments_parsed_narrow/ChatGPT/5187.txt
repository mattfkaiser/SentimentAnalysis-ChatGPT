I am concerned this is BS. If this is real… if the kid who got suspended didn’t cheat he should take this to court if it hurts his grades. 

ChatGPT is a LLM (Large Language Model) it a machine learning based text transformer which ultimately means just like how y=mx+b gives you a slope, you give chat GPT text and it gives you text back based of off probability and/or regression from the text it was trained on.

Anyways, theres billions of factors that influence the GPT models. For a school to be so ignorant to let their teacher suspend a student because likely 3.5turbo barely understood the prompt and give him a BS response is absurd and needs to contact an attorney.
