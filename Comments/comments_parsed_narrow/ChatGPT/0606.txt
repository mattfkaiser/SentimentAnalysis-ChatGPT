"Numbers 31" in English Standard Version Bible (Moses telling his men to kill young girls families and marry them),  Biblical apocrypha (Mary being 14), According to the Jewish Women's archive Rebekah was 14. According to Midrashic tradition, Rebekah was 3. According to Sunni Islam, Aisha was 9, I'm pretty sure the Hadiths are easily found for that.

I listed Hindu stuff with precision.

Yeah. I don't hate any religion. Religion is just a bunch of words on paper. I hate the people that use the words on paper to defend kid diddlers in churches or child marriage yadayadayada.

But, Moses would be pretty sick in the head, if he did what Numbers 31 say he did, which was literally ordering his men to kill Midian families and take little girls as brides. Muhammad is pretty demented if he married a 9 year old according to Hadith. Shia's think believe she was 18, so I don't have as many issues with them, except that they hate homosexuals which is abhorrent.

I know this stuff, because I read your books thoroughly. Every detail, many books. There's multiple Bibles, multiple Hadith versions, multiple Torah exegesis and so on.

I am not here to hate people. I literally just said what I asked ChatGPT and you all freaked the fuck out. That tells me all I need to know. Hypocrites, pedophile defenders. That's what a lot of people here, fundamentally are. Because you freaked out about things, that wouldn't apply to you if you didn't believe in them.

But instead I have a bunch of people who are offended, which is weird given this is the thirtieth post saying the exact same thing about one religion getting off scot free while the others aren't. Like what? What kind of psychopaths are all of you?
