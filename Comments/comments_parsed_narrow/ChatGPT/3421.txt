>in a weird way the kids who are using Chat GPT arenâ€™t they preparing themselves for the future by using cutting edge technology to help them

No, not really. It's pretty easy to learn how to use ChatGPT effectively, and as it improves it'll also start giving better and better prompts for those who aren't great at giving it prompts.

On the other hand for a mathematician, say (my field), it's really important to solve problems on your own and not rely on AI (I'm sure in a few years we'll be at a point where they can solve most undergrad maths exams). You need to exercise your brain, practice your logical reasoning skills and, yes, memorisation is sometimes important (even though you can look things up irl) because that process lets your brain build important connections between things.
