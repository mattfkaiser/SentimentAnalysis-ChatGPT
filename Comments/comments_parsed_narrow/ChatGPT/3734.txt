I'm sorry to hear that you had a frustrating experience with a therapist. As someone who works in the therapy field and has accessed therapy for myself and family members, I agree that there are good and bad mental health professionals out there.

I also enjoy using AI for various purposes. I have been curious about how it could function as a therapist or mental health support because I see the benefits of having an on-demand, accessible, free, non-judgmental, friendly conversational mental health resource. Also AI can be very helpful in breaking down tasks and next steps.

It does have limitations. ChatGPT, for example, can't fully understand what therapeutic approach would work best for you based on your personality and issues. Additionally, it lacks the ability to provide a new perspective on a situation that a human might be able to see. It's important to note that AI systems don't know true from false or good from bad, and may repeat harmful things they have previously read.  I have read and also experienced where it agrees with you even when you are wrong. Then provides false information to back up its response. Also it can not direct you to current resources and help determine wait times as it is not trained on new information. 

So, if you use AI for mental health support it's important to make sure that you are using chatbots that are specifically designed for mental health support and are approved by reliable governing bodies like the FDA. For example Woebot.

Just remember OpenAI (ChatGBT ) does have access to your data (you can choose not to allow them to learn from your data). Also, as with anything on the internet, it can be hacked, so you should avoid putting any identifying information in. If you are worried about someone seeing your conversations, clear your conversations immediately after reading. 

I wish you the very best in finding the support you need and deserve for yourself and your child.
