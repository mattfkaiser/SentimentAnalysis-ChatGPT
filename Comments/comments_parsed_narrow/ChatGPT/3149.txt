I absolutely agree. I find that having to wade through shit tons of links to find something is frustrating and causes less critical thinking when an answer is finally found. When you find the answer it is just accepted because the brain is too tired to think about it critically.
Where as in ChatGPT when you get an answer you can read it, question it and ask for more clarification and sources.
