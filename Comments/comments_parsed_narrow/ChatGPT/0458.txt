I wrote my mom letters for a couple years when she passed. In truth is was me journaling through my grief, but she was the one I’d turn to when horrible things would happen so even a one-sided conversation helped provide me some level of reassurance. Had ChatGPT been around at the time, maybe I would have used it the same way. I remember wishing for some way to properly say goodbye. 

Loss is such a complex experience to navigate. It’s hard to fault someone for the things they do to get through it. You’re not hurting anyone and you’re aware it’s not real.

I’m so sorry for your loss.
