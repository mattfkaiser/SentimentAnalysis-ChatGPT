• "However," and "In summary," if they have never used it before or if they are repeated too many times across multiple assignments. The same applies to "It's important to remember".

• Another red flag could be using terms way above their usual level. Basically, if one of your students' writing style has changed overnight, that could be a sign.

A student may ask it to write in a more personal style though, so you won't be able to catch it even if it was actually written by ChatGPT. Good luck.
