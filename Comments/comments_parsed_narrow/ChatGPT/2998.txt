When machines started replacing manual work, jobs were generated in which people needed to control machines and use their brains, aka, the smart jobs.

But AI is limitless and self learning. It also has the capacity to control and self control. Its mental capabilities are far ahead of humans. AGI, once developed, will have even far ahead mental capabilities, with emotions too. Manual work has been replaced, now mental work is being replaced. Except mind and the body, what has humans to showcase?

One thing is left though, the coordination b/w kind and the body. AI is already powerful enough today with ChatGPT like models. All it needs is a body. The day AGI robots start to be mass manufactured, which I estimate will be by the end of this century, humans will lose their only remaining advantage of mind-body coordination.
