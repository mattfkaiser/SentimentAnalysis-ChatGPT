Think about it this way... we have had Google for more of our lives more than the older generation. So we know how to translate for google

>movie city of alience on earth

That's not an english sentence and unless you were trained (via experience) you would not think to input that. It's the most efficient search engine prompt to get your result. You had do deconstruct the statement to make it easier to understand for google, which is a learned skill. Ai makes it so that she does not need to learn how to prompt engineer for google. She just need to talk like she is talking to another person, which she has been doing her entire life. Saying that they overlap is irrelevant, because she would have never come to that prompt for google in the first place. If you put her prompt into Google you get "Mars Attacks", "evolution" and a whole bunch of listings for "top 50 alien movies". Chat gpt is plain better at understanding a user's request. Google compiles information to for technical fields so it's more reliable, but it kindof sucks at actually producing the result you want. I've noticed that all of my google searches are in broken English because that is the only thing that works. I use chat gpt and the open AI playground for most things, but looking up info I use bing (bing sucks and their AI has gotten worse with fine tuning, but it's still more efficient as a search engine than google, just not as a chatbot)
