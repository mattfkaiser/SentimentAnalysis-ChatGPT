Chat gpt feels as much emotions as my fan does. Even the word gpt is self explanatory, it means generative progressive text. So it just studied many text data and tried to generate which word from it's then current output would be the best output. It isn't feeling anything or even explaining anything, it's just doing what we programmed it to do. Similarly my fan is rotating when electrical energy from it is converted into mechanical energy. It doesn't feel/understand anything but it still rotates.
