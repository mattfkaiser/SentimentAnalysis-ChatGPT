I have yet to get anything useful out of chatGPT for my job. Even simple requests like writing SQL statements to pull a report from a DB result in queries that don't even match the schema, and the corrections I provide appear to be ignored. Now, if I were more interested in writing text or summarizing the contents of a document or I needed a proofreader, chatGPT would be useful tool, but I don't really need that.
