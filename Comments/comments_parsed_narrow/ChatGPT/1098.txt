I'll never forget my dumbass 6th grade teacher losing her fuckin mind when she noticed a pattern of some students using sparknotes to describe a passage from Shakespeare. It was mostly the "good/smart kids" who got in trouble because we were fucking 6th graders and wanted to know wtf Shakespeare was trying to say. We read the passage, didn't have a clue what it was about, and looked up the only website we knew at the time to help us understand it. 

She made a huge fucking deal about it, lectured the class for like 20 minutes about how dissapointed she was in a group of kids, then asked that group to stay after class (so everyone else got to know who was involved in this horrendous scandal). 

Worst part was that it was some small homework assignment where she just wanted us to  make our best guess at what the passage was about. We just genuinely wanted to understand it better but evidently it was too spot on and our work was too similar between us sinners. Multiple parties had to get involved to talk her out of putting up all this disciplinary shit to calm her down.

I'm 28 and still salty af about it lol... imagine this scenario in a different context. Like imagine you're a farmer dad 500 years ago and you're pissed at your kid for using a rake instead of his bare hands to help plant his crops 

We have some incredible tools at our disposal these days and yet we waste a ton of time acting like it doesn't exist until you graduate, on a matter of principle. 

Instead we spend a fuck ton of time memorizing pointless shit or repeating certain subjects that we've already covered several times before over the years. I'd have fuckin loved to get into more advanced shit as opposed to memorizing formulas or random facts that have not come up again in my life since graduation.

Can't help but wonder how many usefull skills I could have learned to prepare me for my adult life that were never taught because God dammit I better know the formulas for calculating the area of 2 dimensional shapes or else I'm gonna be fucked as an adult. 

I'm not saying we should give 1st graders graphic calculators and tablets with access to ChatGPT. But maybe when you reach... idk... high school we can stop worrying so much about smaller details and start focusing on the application of the ideas, facts, and concepts we have been and will be exposed to once we graduate. 

That's just me though...

TLDR: The American education system is so fucking stupid.
