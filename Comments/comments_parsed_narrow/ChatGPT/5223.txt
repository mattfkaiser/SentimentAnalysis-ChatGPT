I am blown away by all these stories of professors so fundamentally misunderstanding AI and reacting poorly to it.

I guess I shouldn't be? Academics tend to be older folks who've been trained by easy solutions like [turnitin.com](https://turnitin.com),  I guess?

But yeah, that isn't how this works.

If I were a teacher I'd be very straight-up with my students and just be like "Unless you are dumb enough to leave in 'as an AI language model...' in your papers, I'm not going to be able to tell if you stole from Chat GPT. But C-level papers that cheat you out of learning aren't going to help you get a job when you graduate, so if you want to pay an extraordinary amount of money to fail to get an education in that manner, that's up to you."

Like seriously, though. What are we doing here?
