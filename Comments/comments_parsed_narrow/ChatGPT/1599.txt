lol perfect timing to announce the Android app I'm leveraging Chat GPT to work on.

This only displays on a PC afaik (it doesn't display well on my phone screen). 50% of the code was generated with ChatGPT. It's still not MVP but my idea is to create an x by x grid (it's currently 16x16) and then swap between screens making animation possible.

Maybe Chat GPT won't create the sprites but hopefully my app will make it easier!
