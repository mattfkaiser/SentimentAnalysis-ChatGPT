They... They just asked chatgpt if it wrote it? And suspended someone over that? That's a *lawsuit* waiting to happen, my god that professor shouldn't have a job anymore if they are that stupid.

It isn't a bug, chatgpt *does not understand the concept*. To ask it if that's something it wrote, there's no way it can possibly know the answer- so, what'll it answer? Randomly! Literally whatever the fuck it wants to spit out.

Hell, there are *legal disclaimers stating that things the model generates may contain outright falsehoods*- if this professor based a suspension solely on that, there's a *VERY* good lawsuit waiting to happen here.
