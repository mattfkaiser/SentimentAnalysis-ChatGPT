Hmm it’s not a bad idea actually. I’d be curious to hook up a specially trained ChatGPT model to dating apps to automatically start conversations, learn from mistakes, etc. 

Years ago, I hired off-shore workers to manage my Tinder account, swipe for me, start conversations. Was kinda disappointed in the results. But, OpenAI may do better.
