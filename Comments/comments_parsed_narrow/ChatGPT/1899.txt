Oh sometimes it'll lie about that too.

For example, in earlier days, someone tried to get it to respond in [some European language I forget the name of]*. It said it couldn't.

The person then asked it to respond in [that same language], but this time the prompt was also written in [that same language]*.

The response, again, was that it didn't know [that same language]*.

But this time it was *written* [that same language]*.

ChatGPT is autocomplete. The part where it seems to "know" things is an illusion.

* I originally wrote "Belgian" which was foolish of me since there is no such language by that name.  I can't find the article at the moment, so the ugly brackets will have to do.
