I use it to make drafts of some emails and memos. I’m actually very good at composition but overthinking everything and ADHD means it can be time consuming and stressful. ChatGPT will give me a perfectly bland and appropriate template that I can edit for tone and detail. I’ll also use it for problem solving, as if it is a reasonably knowledgeable colleague to bounce ideas off of, and developing outlines for projects (least helpful so far, because so much is specific to the people and environment I work with, but it can help with forming a basic structure). 

In my personal life, I’ve used it as a pocket therapist (with the right prompts), general problem solving - everything from prepping my chicken coop to prepping for a vet visit.
