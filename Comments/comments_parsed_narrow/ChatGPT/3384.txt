The number of times that I've gone to write a paper, struggled my way through one or two paragraphs and realized: Man, I've having a really hard time developing this idea... maybe it's cuz this is the wrong idea to develop?

If I could've just said "Ah, the hell with it: ChatGPT, please finish this paper for me!", then yeah I would've finished the thing that I set out to make... but I never would've realized that I set out to make the wrong thing.
