I don't think anyone up this thread is directly challenging that notion, the only challenge here is would you know sentience when presented with it? What is the difference between a creature saying it feels and actually feeling? 

You can't truly even claim consistency of emotion is an indicator otherwise I know many humans who would not be sentient, especially if we toss in mental disorders with that inconsistency as a direct symptom.

Can't claim a proper understanding and theory of mind and the signs of one to be a sign. That's actually incredibly uncommon in sentience we are more so an exception to that one. Even if we weren't, AI kinda already shows that to a degree. If you were to use this as evidence the fact it has a preference of making up information instead of seeking information from you and just asking questions can very arguably be used as a sign against it exhibiting a the understanding to separate it's own thoughts from yours but it's pretty darn good at faking an understanding of it. Arguably though we will likely invent an AI with a theory of mind and strong sense of self long before we make one truly sentient and then things will get really confusing!

We use to give the argument that sentience was the ability to know the logic of something but then defy that logic due to our feelings and that's why computer programs weren't sentient. Issue here being chatGPT fully expresses that ability to not behave in logically consistent ways and often doing things that seem more emotion and behaviorally driven than logically driven. Again no argument here from me, I agree it is not sentient. The fact it demonstrates this one so easily and perfectly though should imply this is not a method to prove sentience.

A common and honestly not terrible argument is that machine sentience just simply isn't possible. Though I'd like anyone who makes that argument to explain why organic sentience is in that case and how you'd even go about proving you yourself are in fact sentient to an alien that doesn't believe you. Can you see a scenario where raised in captivity as an lab experiment by these aliens being told sentience is impossible for you and you're really good at faking it, after years, where you'd start to believe them too? 

Final argument that could be thrown that needs to be acknowledged is just the religious one that sentience is god-given. Under this argument still where is your definition? If we just skip the god argument and both play along that your argument ok d fair and true. We more or less already can and do grow animals in a lab, are they sentient? We can and do make computers directly out of active brain cells, are those able to be sentient? If this is where your answer is still no then I think we are just stalled out here and there is no debate, as often can happen with differing beliefs ðŸ¤·
