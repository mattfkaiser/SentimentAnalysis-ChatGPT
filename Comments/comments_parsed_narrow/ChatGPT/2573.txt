That may be the case right now…maybe, but it certainly will not be case for long.  Tbh, I do not believe it is the case right now, but that remains to be seen, at least to an extent.  

For a few years there have been AI-powered drones that drop bombs without human clearance.  Bombs. 

Per the Senior VP at Google on 60 Minutes (4/19/23) a few weeks ago:

“They’re not sentient. They’re not aware of themselves. They can exhibit behaviors that look like that. Because, keep in mind they’ve learned from us.  We’re sentient beings. We have feelings, emotions, ideas, thoughts, perspectives—we’ve reflected all that in books, in novels, in fiction.  

So when they learn from that they build patterns from that. So it’s no surprise to me that the exhibited behavior sometimes looks like there’s somebody behind there…” 

Scott Pelley continues: 
“…Could Hemingway write a better short story? Maybe. But Bard can write a million [short stories] before Hemingway can finish one. Imagine that level of automation across the economy.” 

If you think for a second these studios (or newly founded studios) won’t upload every book, script and play ever created into their own in-house LLM/ChatGPT, then you’re in for a rude awakening.  

Stanford created their own LLM with $600.  What is possible for a multimillion/multibillion dollar studio right now?  In 2 years? 5 years? 

We’re barely in the first inning of this technology and it’s already incredible (for better or worse).  Even the engineers themselves admit they don’t know how it learns and teaches itself certain things.  

Per the AI Dilemma (3/9/2023), already somewhat outdated: 

“In 2018, GPT had no theory of mind. In 2019, barely any theory of mind. In 2020 it starts to develop the strategy of a 4 year old. By 2022 January, it’s developed the strategy level of a 7 year old. And by November of last year, it’s developed almost the strategy of a 9 year old…we only discovered it had this capability last month.” 

Bottom line, do not underestimate this technology.  The US government is unlikely to interfere or place any guardrails on it.  They’re too distracted by nonsense.  We shall see what happens.  Hope everything I’m seeing is wrong and you are right, but I’m not optimistic.
