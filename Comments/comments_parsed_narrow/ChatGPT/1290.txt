Hi Vegetable\_Log3622!! I'm a graduate student working on publishing a research paper that analyzes user trends and behaviors of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools during the summer. I'm interested in understanding how you perceive ChatGPT Plus in comparison to other services, what motivates you to pay for it, and what your usage levels (queries/day) and types of queries are. Please note that only aggregate metrics will be used for the paper's findings, and all data will be anonymized.

If you're interested in taking part, please fill out the Google Form survey using the link provided below. Your input would be immensely valuable to my research. Thank you in advance for your time and contribution! [https://forms.gle/8BSAJHPX7F3NcqLH7](https://forms.gle/8BSAJHPX7F3NcqLH7)
