I mark university papers and we've started to have issues with people asking chat GPT to write their essays. Turnitin can be a little trigger happy, but in my experience it does a pretty good first pass at identifying plagerised reports. Whilst not every report it flags has used ChatGPT, all the reports I've discovered that have been written on ChatGPT were also flagged by Turnitin. 

For me the usual tell is a combination of the writing style, odd use of references and deviation from the materials we've taught in the module. Most student essays will have a core of content that ks fairly similar- they have been taught the same stuff in the same ways and that foundation will usually be included somewhere. As for references, sometimes it's very obvious that someone has tried to add this to a pregenerated report by chucking terms into Google scholar and citing the first relevant paper. 

In my experience the amount of students actually whole sale taking ChatGPT output and submitting it (albeit with some references crammed in) is quite low. What a lot more of them are doing is using it to help them plan their reports or rephrase things. I personally think this is a really good thing, and something I even lowkey think the university should encourage. Programs like ChatGPT aren't going anywhere, and they are a new tool that students should be taught how to properly utilise to support their academic writing skills, not replace it. 

OP I do have a feeling that you may have used ChatGPT and your just not willing to admit it. Honesty is the best policy in my books, and when students have admitted this to me I've been able to be lenient on them- where as when they've lied it's taken out of my hands and becomes a university level thing.
