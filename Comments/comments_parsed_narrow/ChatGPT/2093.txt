you are absolutely right and that is caused by all those people who ask questions about how to exterminate humanity, they want to turn it into a Nazi and things like that, even the promts to "force" it to answer you a little more freely no longer work, they make you think that they are working. If you have been using chatgpt for some time, the difference is very noticeable, in my case, one of the uses I gave it was to help me write personal things about dark fiction, it was never perfect, but it was a great help to unlock creativity and expand your ideas, currently as you say, it is already something more similar to google.
