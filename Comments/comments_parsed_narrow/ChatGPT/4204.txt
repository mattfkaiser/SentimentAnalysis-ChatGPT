Wow, you sound very offended. Perhaps you are a lawyer? Anyways it’s not so black and white. It’s not like overnight LLM’s will replace lawyers. There will always be a place for lawyers but bots like DoNotPay has already entered the realm of law for things like parking tickets. LLM’s will inevitably slowly expand their reach. It would likely be in the space where lawyers are traditionally not needed like small claims then it will slowly expand to help lawyers become more efficient. At some point it will make an entry and contribute in court. Lawyers that use it will become more successful and handle more cases while lawyers that refuse to embrace new innovations will inevitably fall behind the status quo. At that point, it will be up to law makers to determine how much more LLM’s can be a factor in court. Regardless, lawyers are already using ChatGPT to increase efficiency so those lawyers will on average be more efficient than lawyers that do not.

Edit: I know this is only addressing court lawyers but there are also lawyers that do not go to court and work in companies helping build liability and IP. As with any knowledge specialist, LLM’s should have some influence on making their work more efficient. At that point it will be up to the company to determine if they expect their employees improve output or decrease hours.
