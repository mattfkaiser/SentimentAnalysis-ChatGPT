ChatGPT is helping you deteriorate by using avoidance instead of acceptance. I will be downvoted/censored into oblivion by chatGPT fanboys, but if you actually take a look at the literature, for example, the number 1 proven way of dealing with panic is exposure therapy, which means actually exposing yourself (though don't do this without the help of a professional) to the panic without trying to avoid it. Getting a human or a robot to artificially/temporarily reduce the intensity of the panic in the moment actually gets in the way of that exposure therapy and reduces your chances of improvement.

This is just one example of how letting lay people use chatGPT for therapy is detrimental. It is basic logic: if people had all the answers, they would not need professionals in the first place. ChatGPT outputs based on what you input. If you don't know what to input you are just creating a negative feedback loop of output. I will now get downvoted into oblivion by all the self proclaimed experts who are clearly all experts, and who have clearly researched this issue in detail, and who clearly are not chatGPT fanboys who are just here to upvote and parrot "yay go chatGPT ANOTHER ONE\[success story due to chatGPT magically immediately solving anything therapy/school/etc..related\]/dj khaled".

>And to be honest I feel like it might remind us a thing or two about  what we miss in human relationships these days, and try to bring that  back into our daily interactions.

Are you literally reading what you are writing? In a world dominated by technology, in which a major issue for people is loneliness and lack of human connection DUE to technology, how is doubling down and relying on AI, which is a computer, generating output text by parroting back what you input to it, making this better? It would be making it worse. How on earth is relying more on technology fixing the issue of "technology replacing human interaction". What even on earth?

>ChatGPT makes me want to be a better listener, be more present, and patient with other humans,

Why don't you just talk to other humans? Why on earth would you need AI to be better at talking to humans, something humans have been doing for 200k years without flaw, and only recently. DUE TO TECHNOLOGY have gotten worse at? What even on earth?

Between this thread and the other one that said "chatGPT saved my life" (because it made the OP realize that having red urine means they should talk to their doctor....), both of which were massively upvoted here.. I don't know which one to be more baffled by. Truly bizarre.
