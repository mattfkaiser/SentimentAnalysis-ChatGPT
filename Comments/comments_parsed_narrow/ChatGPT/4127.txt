HAHAHHAHA This is called "LLM Hallucination" and that's exactly what makes LLMs so quick and powerful. This is caused by the ability of these LLMs to identify patterns in data intuitively. Since the pattern there is extremely broad, it will also start connecting patterns in a very generalized way and make conclusions against its own trained data. The result is a response that looks extremely like real data but it's entirely made up real-time.

Through the API, you can achieve it by using \`temperature\` between 1 and 2 (maximum level of randomness).

On ChatGPT it increases the temperature automatically depending on the need for randomness. Since you sent a request that requires access to complex pattern recognition, its answers will be as random and sometimes convincing as the patterns it has collected.

Btw that works with any character repetition.
