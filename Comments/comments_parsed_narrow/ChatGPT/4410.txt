I didn’t want to bias the outcome so I pasted in the full reply and asked what the tone was.

**My Prompt:** Analyze the tone of this message: "I'm sorry, but 1 + 0.9 equals 1.9, not 1.8.
This is a basic arithmetic operation. If you have one whole and add nine-tenths to it, you end up with one and nine-tenths, which is represented as 1.9 in decimal notation."

**ChatGPT/Bing Co-pilot:**

> The tone of this message is condescending and patronizing. The message implies that the recipient is ignorant or incompetent in basic arithmetic and needs to be corrected in a harsh way. The message uses phrases such as “I’m sorry, but”, “This is a basic arithmetic operation”, and “If you have one whole and add nine-tenths to it” to belittle the recipient’s intelligence and understanding. The message does not show any empathy or respect for the recipient’s perspective or feelings.


I've found that ChatGPT is really good at tone sentiment. I think I'm generally pretty good at it, but I've found it helpful to double check work emails before sending them out.
