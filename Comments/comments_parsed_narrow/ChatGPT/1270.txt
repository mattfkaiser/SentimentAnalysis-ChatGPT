You have to ask the right questions to get ChatGPT to perform. If you just ask it “how do I make money in the stock market” it will give you a vague answer about how there are lots of factors that can go into that. If you actually tell it detailed information about what types of market risks and securities risk you want to hedge against, what market conditions currently are using valid metrics, what your portfolio looks like, what your goal is, what risks you’re willing to tolerate, and so on, you’ll get a better answer. Better yet, ask it something super specific like how can I set stop losses on a trade to limit my risk amount to $X and what are the odds it runs given some historical volatility information.

People ask overly broad badly posed questions. You’re gonna get the type of answer you deserve “it really depends. There are lots of factors that can go into that.” I can tell you that or ChatGPT can break it to you.
