More so traditional academia will become obsolete. I almost trust ChatGPT more to give my children a personalized learning experience across a wide spectrum of topics than some of the underpaid, underappreciated public school teachers in my area. College is a whole different ball park.Who needs to pay 70k tuition per semester at Columbia to sit in an auditorium with 400 other students now and get a fraction of the instructors time and attention? That's all about to change with GPT and I think these institutions will need to adapt or die.

I bet college applications plummet this up coming year.
