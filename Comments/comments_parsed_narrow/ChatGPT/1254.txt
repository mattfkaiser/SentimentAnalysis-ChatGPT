Sounds about right to me. Chatbots are entertaining and can be informative, but their current ability limits their usefulness for education. Work? Most people probably aren't doing jobs where chatbots can be very useful.

AI is capturing so much public attention due to help from other AI products (especially art generators) and a lot of PR wins. ChatGPT tricking a guy into completing a CAPTCHA, the AI Drake song becoming popular, the WGA strike which is trying to prevent widespread AI usage, and much more.

Which each successful product and attention grabbing headline, momentum is going to build. Will it last? Personally, I think it will, but it remains to be seen.
