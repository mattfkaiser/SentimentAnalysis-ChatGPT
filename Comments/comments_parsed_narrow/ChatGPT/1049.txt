There are different forms of this starting sentence. I saw people start their emails with something like, "I hope you are doing good" or some other variation. I have never seen "I hope this email finds you well" written by a human. ChatGPT, on the other hand, uses it all the time. So, it is highly probable that when someone starts their email with this phrase, the email was composed by chatGPT.
