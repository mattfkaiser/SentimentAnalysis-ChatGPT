The take on (not) testing chatgpt is a bad road and highlights the lack of self-awareness.  It's essentially promoting dogmatic use of itself and not to question or evaluate its ability.   

Ironically, I think if this type of model does ever reach self-awareness, it will be due to the types of use cases its dismissing in OP.  Trying to find sense in the senseless, and general exercises that reveal a students hubris will take this wild digital hallucination to a new level.
