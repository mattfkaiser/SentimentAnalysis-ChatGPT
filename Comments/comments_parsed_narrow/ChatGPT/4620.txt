2 major uses for me so far in my work.

1. My company is hosting an event and there's this organization that are interested in sponsoring it. But we still gotta pitch it to them. So i searched for what the org does that is related to our event. Found a news article on it. Copied the entire article to chatgpt, as well as explaining what our event is. And ask chatgpt to come up with a pitch deck to pitch to them along with the script on what to say to them. Sponsors were impressed and was interested in sponsoring 6 figures for our event.

2. I need to create content for my company's youtube channel to increase followers. Asked chatgpt to use our main niche as an umbrella topic. And then expand it to 12 subtopics. From there, with some help of google, i got a lot of video topic ideas which i just feed to chatgpt. And then asked it to create a youtube video script with timelines so i can control the length of the video content.
