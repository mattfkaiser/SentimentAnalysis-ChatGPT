Not if we start putting rags in booze bottles and sharpening some very large razors for Msr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin's innovative haircut.

Jokes aside, we're on track to a collapse right now WITHOUT the existence of AI. In the alternate universe where ChatGPT not existing is the first branching point, they're also seeing that things are getting frighteningly close to breaking. 

There are entire generations that are generally choosing not to have children because of how bad things are getting economically. The entire basis of capitalism requires a growing population, and it breaks down if that doesn't happen.

The current relationship between consumer and producer requires an abundance of consumers, which is *growing*. Imagine a company that has a total monopoly on a necessary service. "The Water Company," for example.

If people stop having children or have children below the population maintenance rate, growth is impossible. Every possible customer is already buying from them. They are charging as much as possible. Year on year, their profit margins are decreasing. No one will invest in a company that can only promise losses, year on year. Once investment is no longer lucrative in the absolute surest possible bet, then everything collapses. 

In the world where that's the point we're at, we'd first see major moves against abortion (*cough*), then major moves against contraception (*COUGH*), then forced breeding programs, mass state-sponsored sexual slavery, etc... I don't think that any course of events that doesn't conclude in fire and blood when the law comes for contraception is particularly realistic.

I think that a revolution is more likely than a regression into feudalism. The existence of AI in our timeline means that the world that comes after is more likely to be a better one.
