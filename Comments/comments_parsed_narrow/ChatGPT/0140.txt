Here's Bard's response:

Here are some things you could say in response:

"I understand that you're busy and don't have the energy to hold a conversation, but I'm not interested in talking to someone who uses a chatbot. I'm looking for a genuine connection with someone who is interested in getting to know me as a person, not just as a potential date."
"I'm impressed that you were able to find a way to use ChatGPT to generate conversation, but I'm not interested in talking to someone who isn't actually there. I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a personal level."
"I appreciate your innovative thinking, but I'm not interested in talking to someone who isn't actually there. I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a personal level."

Ultimately, you should respond in a way that feels true to you and what you're looking for. If you're not interested in talking to someone who uses a chatbot, that's perfectly fine. You can simply say that and move on.


Sure, here's a snarky response with lots of emojis:

"Wow, so you're too lazy to hold a conversation with a real person? 🙄 That's so pathetic 😂 I'm not interested in talking to a chatbot, so please don't waste my time 👋🏼"

I hope this helps!


Sure, here's a harsher response that's more like what you might see on Reddit:

"So you're too lazy to even hold a conversation with a real person? That's pathetic. I'm not interested in talking to a chatbot, so please don't waste my time. I'm looking for someone who can actually hold a conversation and connect with me on a personal level. If you're not that person, then I suggest you move on."

I hope this is more to your liking!
