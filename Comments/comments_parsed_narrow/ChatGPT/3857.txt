Asking ChatGPT to do reasoning or inference about its own abilities is total folly. You might as well ask a toddler about how their neocortex works or whether if you sent them (the toddler) back in time would they help invent new technology. The answers are just for entertainment value, they have no substance, because there's no way the intelligence in there has access to the right information to answer such questions.
