I write my own stories, but I let it write fanfics for me sometimes. In general Chat ChatGPT ain't really good at writing "actual" stories. But it's real good at individual scenes and plot suggestions. 

Working with ChatGPT as a writer is like having a little assistant you can brainstorm with. It helped me with a bunch of blocks already. Especially when it roughly remembers your story.
