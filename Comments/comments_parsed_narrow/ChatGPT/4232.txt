While this is generally the case, it’s not always enough. Just look at the number of companies interested in psychedelic research. Something that is already very illegal, unlike LLMs.


If enough people think it’s beneficial (really depends how censored ChatGPT gets), it will become a thing. I also think that OpenAI has gone past what any reasonable regulation would be. Not trying to say those companies will break those regulations, but not add their own internal policies.
