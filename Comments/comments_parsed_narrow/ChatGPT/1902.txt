Also, it needs a better spine. Dear chatGPT: If I **ask** whether something you just gave me meets a certain criteria *and it does*, please don’t apologize and then fix the not-broken thing. 🤦🏼‍♀️

Also: I learned today that even 4 can’t make a classroom seating chart with challenging but meetable parameters better nor faster than I can with index cards and a table. I figured it was so logic-based that surely an AI that can write code could put students into groups with one of three requested neighbors, and if not that then with a neighbor who requested them, but keep these five kids in separate groups. 

Sigh.
