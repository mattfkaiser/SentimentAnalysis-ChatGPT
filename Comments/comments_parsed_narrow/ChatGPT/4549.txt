I used it last night to set up a spreadsheet full of healthy eating & exercise goals for the month of May. Its all step by step (daily and weekly), with recipes (breakfast, lunch & dinner) based on ingredients I have and my dietary needs. Hydration, study, and hobby time goals was next, and that's all sorted too. It was just a little experiment to see how it would all work, and I swear...its flawless! It would have taken me a few days to sort out a schedule, yet it took only an hour with ChatGPT.
