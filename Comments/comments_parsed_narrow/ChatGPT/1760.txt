I always write the rough draft first, and then ask chatgpt "make this better: Ctrl+V".  If I don't like it I write "Try again, but make it more sincere like talking to friends and family" or "Make it very professional, but not cold in tone, I want them to feel apart of the message and not held at a distance"  


ChatGPT will take those requests and completely change the messaging.  I use this all the time for emails where I don't know how to create healthy barriers with someone without it sounding like I'm telling them to fuck off and never bother me again.  So ChatGPT has been really saving me from talks with HR.  lol
