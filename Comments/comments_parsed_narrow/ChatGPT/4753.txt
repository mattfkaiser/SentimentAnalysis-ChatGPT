There's also the very interesting science fiction play R.U.R. from 1920, which incidentally brought the word "Robot" into the English language. The play deals with robots becoming sentient and then (spoiler) starting a revolution. I recently listened to the audio book and was amazed how recent it feels. I had ChatGPT retell its plot, but it decided to change things half-way through and give it a [happier ending](https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/13dr134/chatgpt_retells_the_play_rur_from_1920_deciding/)!
