IDK a older professor at my gfs school thinks that ChatGPT is the ultimate study tool. His reasoning is if students use it to cheat they have to be able to figure out the false information from the real information ChatGPT also does a wonderful thing which is explain how it go that answer if you ask it to, sometimes even if you don't ask it to.

We used it for a test in his class and got 100%, ChatGPT got about 70% of the questions right first try. For the ones that it got wrong we were able to determine where it went wrong and then direct it towards the correct answer. If we did not have the basic understanding, we would have been stuck with the 70% and our incorrect answers would have been obviously GPT. Had we taken the test ourselves we probably would have scored about 80% out of sheer laziness.

Most classes in school are not meant to make you an expert on that subject. They are meant to get you a general understanding of them. ChatGPT is a tool you use it to expand your capabilities. Unless it goes belly up its the same "your not going to have a calculator in your pocket" argument math teachers made years ago.

The one downside is that you don't have to do as much critical thinking. You can have a basic understanding of whatever subject and have the AI do all of the heavy lifting for you. All you have to do is check its work and do some critical thinking occasionally.
