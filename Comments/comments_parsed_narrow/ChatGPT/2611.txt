I kindof find it annoying when people don't use the latest version then complain about how much it sucks, then don't disclose that. Not everyone knows that they are color coded so no everyone will know you are on 3.5 and not 4. If it does this on four, sure complain. By the way, a agree with you that security is not strong in ai yet even for 4, I'm just ranting about all of the posts that I was like "what? Is it really that bad for some people? It works pretty good for me" then seeing that it's 3.5. Almost like they are trying to say chat GPT as a whole is shit, and it's hiding the useful information. I understand that not everyone can afford a paid plan to get 4, but you could have said "To all the people out there who think ChatGPT 3.5 can be a good AI for security:"
