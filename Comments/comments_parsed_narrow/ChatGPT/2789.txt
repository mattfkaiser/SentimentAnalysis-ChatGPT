AI is trained on weights and probabilities that the next word would most likely follow the words before it given the context of the prompt.  

So it makes sense that random number generation doesn't work in this application since it's completely trained to pick the most probable outcome.

In the OpenAI playground you can play around with the seeding so that it can give more creative or more rigidly defined responses, but I bet ChatGPT is fixed.
