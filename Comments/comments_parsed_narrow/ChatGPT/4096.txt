ChatGPT is a language model based on mimicry. It has been fed a shit ton of data but it can not discern if something is true or false. It can’t reason. It doesn’t know you are a person. It is generating text based on prediction from its data set. 

I, personally, would not call it an AI. It’s not general or specific or specialized. It is a tool. The danger is when people think that tool is more than it is.

It definitely won’t be taking anyone’s job. Unless you’re really bad at your job and your job was to generate text.
