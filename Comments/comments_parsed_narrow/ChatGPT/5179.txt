I’ve had the same type of interaction with chat GPT. Most of the time it’s spot on but there have been times where I didn’t know the information so I rephrase the question and it was able to answer it and I asked it why it wasn’t able to give me that information the first time and it just apologize to me said it was incorrect and you know it’s still working out the bugs. 
For them to suspend you because of this is pretty ridiculous if you ask me
