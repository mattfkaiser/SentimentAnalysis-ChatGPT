Sorry for your loss.  But it's not even smart AI it's dumb AI. It's not your mom and a few texts doesn't even touch who she was.  To me this feels like a bot shamelessly plugging chat gpt.  But if not again I feel for you but that's not your mom, reach out to family and friends.  I mean it isn't even a neural network.
