When I first discovered ChatGPT I had so much fun plugging in things like, "pretend you are a psychiatric nurse, and your patient \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Respond to your patient." 

It surprisingly has some great scripts that are naturally written and are appropriate for the clinical situation I give it. It could be very useful for new grads or anyone who struggles talking to people suffering from mental illness.
