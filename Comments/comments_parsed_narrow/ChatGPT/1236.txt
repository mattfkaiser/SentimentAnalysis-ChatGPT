Yeah, what your not getting from those statistics is that ChatGPT only opened up to the public about 6 months ago and had already become significantly useful to 20% of the entire world that even know what it is. The rest may have only heard about it, or simply not know what to do with it yet.

For comparison, the Internet was "invented" in the 1960s, and the first web browser was invented in 1990. The Internet has only become a daily aspect of our lives in the past 10-15 years with the onset of cloud services and smart phones.

So 6 months to already demanding this level of attention is an epic deal.
