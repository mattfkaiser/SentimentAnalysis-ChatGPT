what do you mean? chat gpt says 对我来说，这都是希腊文 and 希腊文 means Greek. someone else in the comments suggested saying 对我来说，这本书就跟天书一样难懂 where 天书 means writing of heaven but is a more general way of saying something illegible. I'm a non-native speaker, but I don't think what chat gpt said is particularly idiomatic.
