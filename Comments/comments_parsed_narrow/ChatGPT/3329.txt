This is me! I'm a PhD student, so I teach undergrad classes. I just learned how to use ChatGPT for my own work. 

Two weeks later, I'm grading students' papers. Now that I understand how ChatGPT works, I see the very specific pattern that the software generates within their essays. 

BTW, the writing it generates *is horrible!* It's gibberish garbage. But it has the potential to synthesize and summative challenging content. Just don't copypasta. 

In a class of 60 students, at least 6 of my students copy-and-pasted their entire essay. When I confronted them, they didn't even deny it! It's so frustrating. 

My goal for next quarter is to teach the students how to use ChatGPT for their studies during week one of the quarter. 

So, just as you said, I learned how to use it and what a great tool it is. And by doing that, it helps me evaluate the students. More people (especially instructors) need to get with the time.

**ChatGPT in Education:** it's a search engine on steroids. You ask a question, it pulls content from all over the web to give you an answer. This is helpful **and** you need to fact check on your own because it's often wrong. The helpful part is that it gives you a starting point.
