Well said! As someone else mentioned, until recently, whenever I needed something past the cutoff date I'd use Bing Creative, but for literally anything else ChatGPT is a more more effective tool for learning and searching. And now with plugins and web browsing, I'd say I'm basically done with what now seems to be a rather antiquated search engine.
