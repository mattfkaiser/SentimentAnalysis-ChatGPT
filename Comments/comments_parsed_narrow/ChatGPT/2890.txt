On the french Quora there are a lot of answers that are translated from english by translation noobs. You can easily see it because the grammar is too simplistic and the expressions are weird and not used in the right way, or some expressions that don't exist at all in french are translated word for word. It really hurts to read them sometimes. But sometimes I noticed such answers but when I checked the authors I saw that it was an original french answer, as if people started to talk like shitty translations. And I even noticed it with myself, I started writing with the same style. And even as I noticed it I could not help it, I felt like an idiot, stuck on a pattern. I wouldn't be surprised if the same happened with chat GPT. And people started writing like an AI rather than the opposite.
