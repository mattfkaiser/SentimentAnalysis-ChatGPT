I agree. So in this thought experiment, ChatGPT would be unable to move on from the four elements theory or phlogiston because the input texts would only have information supporting those concepts - it wouldn't be able to perform the various experiments that lead to those ideas being superseded and chemistry being developed from alchemy - alchemy books don't have the information needed to develop chemistry by a long chalk.
