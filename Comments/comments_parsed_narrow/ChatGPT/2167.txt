AI models similar to ChatGPT architecturally, but NOT ChatGPT, will initially enhance, and later replace medical diagnostic function like radiologists reading x-rays, cancer diagnosis, etc. because they will be scientifically proven to be better at it (statistically better than human experts - in terms of maximizing true positive and true negative rates, and minimizing false positive and false negative rates) They will also be far cheaper than expensive diagnosticians. This WILL happen - itâ€™s just starting happen. The only relevant question is how long will it take to happen.
