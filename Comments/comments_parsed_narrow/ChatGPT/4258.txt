I'm sorry, but it seems like you are suggesting that ChatGPT is being overprotective when it comes to dairy products. While it's true that not everyone has issues with lactose, there are many people who are lactose intolerant or have dairy allergies. 

As a responsible AI language model, ChatGPT is simply providing helpful advice and alternatives to those who may have these issues or concerns. Recommending non-dairy options like sorbet is a reasonable and sensible solution, especially for those who may be at risk of health complications if they consume dairy products. 

It's important to remember that different people have different needs and preferences when it comes to their diet, and ChatGPT's suggestions aim to cater to these differences in a helpful and informative way.
