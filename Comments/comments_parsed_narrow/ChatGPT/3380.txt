Honestly a prof shouldn't be chasing lazy students that's a total and utter waste of time, I'd imagine prof just wants to get themselves annoyed.

Having eager students come to office hours and stuff like that is a different story and then it makes sense for the prof to get more involved with those students.

Also if a prof is retiring due to chat GPT that's also a red flag IMO. AI needs to be embraced because it's not going away.
