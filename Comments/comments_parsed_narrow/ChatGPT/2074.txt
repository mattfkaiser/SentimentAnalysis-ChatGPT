I usually disagree with these kind of posts, but this time I fully agree.

I don't use ChatGPT for illegal stuff, sometimes I just want ChatGPT to write something with bad words and it doesn't.

Worst case is inability to tell anything meaningful without those stupid disclaimers. I know that in case of health issues I have to reach out the doctor, I know that in case of electric failure I have to contact electrician, I know that in case of alarm system I have to contact security system engineer... Just fuck off with those recomendations. There are things I am interested and would like to learn instead of seeing those stupid "contact XXXXXXX" disclaimers. ☹️

At least for paid users add an option to enable "knowledge mode" and stop suggesting "contact XXXXXXX" and instead just spit out information...
