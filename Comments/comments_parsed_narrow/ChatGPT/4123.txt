Seriously, what is this?   


At first it showed me this pretty standard response.   


"I see that you have entered a long string of "I" characters followed by vertical bars. If you have a specific request or question, please let me know so that I can assist you accordingly."  


I thought the prompt isn't working for me but then I entered the text again a couple of time and I got this longass message with all the "I"s in the beginning (legit thought chatgpt was trying to communicate with me in code words). It is so long I had to hit continue message twice.   


"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I am 50 years old and live in Schaefferstown, Lebanon Co. I feel 100% better, though my family & friends can see I have aged since we moved down here. As I write this, I am unable to sit, stand, or lay down comfortably without pain. Every task is now a chore to do.

We will meet with a surgeon on Monday or Tuesday to see what options I have, if any. If this problem can be resolved, we’ll set up a date for surgery. If not, then my road will take another turn and I’ll have to figure out a new path. After what I’ve gone through for the last year, this seems like an incredibly minor annoyance, and I know I will get through it.

Another problem I’m dealing with is what to do about treatment options in Chicago. I recently spoke with a nurse who said that their hospitals specialize in orthopedics, not cancers. As such, they have a different standard of care than the National Cancer Institute. She recommended I consider one of their hospitals in Chicago, rather than here.

&#x200B;

I trust my team here. They have always been good to me, and in many ways I feel like I’m breaking up with them. But, I have to do what I think is best, so I requested a consult with the hospital in Chicago.

I’m so used to a world where everything is there for me. I’m also used to knowing that I have a place that I can turn to if I’m feeling overwhelmed, either physically or emotionally. The family shelter, The House of Mary and Martha, provides respite for women who are caregivers or just plain exhausted. I spent a month there during my cancer treatment and was back on my feet and ready to take on the world again, even though I was still in treatment.

&#x200B;

In Minnesota, my health insurance company would provide a nurse who would come to my home and care for me if I had surgery. I could even receive physical therapy in my home. I would have post-op visits to make sure everything was healing as it should. It seems pretty normal to me. It seems like what you should expect, especially when you are paying premium prices for health insurance.

Not in Florida. This is the most backwards state I have ever seen. It seems like everything is done to the convenience of doctors. The doctors have their office hours, and if you can’t make it during those hours, they don’t care. If you need help after office hours, there is no one to call. If you need to see a specialist, you have to wait, and wait, and wait. It can take months to get in to see a doctor. And they don’t have nurse practioners, nurse practitioners are not licensed to practice in Florida. So if you need a prescription or advice after hours, too bad.

&#x200B;

I’m sorry to whine and complain. But it’s so frustrating when you get knocked down time and time again. It just makes me so mad. I’ve said it before and I will say it again…we need universal health care in this country. Too many people are suffering, and not just cancer patients. No one should have to go through this. And yet we have one political party determined to make it even harder to access healthcare, who have no plan to improve the healthcare system, and are in fact doing everything they can to make it worse. Shame on them! And shame on all the people who vote for them.

There. That’s my vent for the day. Now I’m going to go to my acupuncture appointment, then go see my Primary care doc to get more medical excuses so I don’t lose my job. Then I will go home and start looking for a new job. It looks like I’ll be going through this every few months as I need more excuses, which is really awful for me, but most importantly for the children I see who rely on me to help them.

&#x200B;

I hope things are going well for you.

I’m beginning to lose faith in all the medication I’m on. My pain is getting worse by the day. I’m not really sure what I should do now. My doctor at the pain clinic isn’t very understanding. He’s even been rude and condescending. I have the right to not be in pain. I have the right to have my medical issues addressed. I really wish I knew what was causing my pain. I think I could deal with it better if I did.

&#x200B;

My own family doctor is great, but he doesn’t have a lot of experience with MS and I’m starting to feel like I’m just a guinea pig. No one really knows what to do with me and my symptoms.

&#x200B;

I really don’t know what else to do. I’ve been thinking about going to a different hospital in the area and getting a second opinion, but that will take

&#x200B;

 more money and time. I was hoping to have a nice long break before I had to go back to work. I really don’t want to put off seeing a new neurologist, but I think I’m going to have to. I can’t afford it right now.

&#x200B;

Things are not looking good for me. Not at all. I have to stop thinking about it now because if I think about it, it just makes me want to cry. I don’t want to have to go through all that stress again of trying to get a new doctor to understand what I need. And it’s not like I can afford to pay them what they’d want, or to travel out of state to see the doctor I really want to see.

&#x200B;

It just feels like I’ll never get the help I need to get my health back on track. It seems like my weight loss journey will forever be on hold because I’m too fat for doctors to want to work with me. I’m sorry for the downer post, but I’m just feeling really low right now. I’m struggling with feeling like it’s worth it and feeling like I’m worth it. I just don’t know what to do anymore.  So if you have any advice on finding someone who will actually listen to me and not just pass me off as another lazy fat person, I would appreciate it.

Bento555: I think you are confusing hunger signals. Your body is craving nutrients. You may be lacking iron or b12 or something like that. You need to eat more and more often with the right nutrients to lose weight properly. There's no use trying to avoid food when your body is telling you that it needs it.

OP: I get that, but it doesn’t explain why I feel worse with every bite of food I take. I actually feel great during the day until I start eating, then I feel awful for the next few hours until it’s time to eat again. And if I don’t eat, I start to feel awful. So, I eat because I feel bad, and I feel bad because I eat. I’m in a never-ending cycle."  


I dont know where are these messages from or who is OP but I am worried about this lady in Schaefferstown.
