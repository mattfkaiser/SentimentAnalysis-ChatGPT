You gotta push past the "sounds great" wall. I found that with colleagues they liked the idea of ChatGPT but didn't use it until I convinced them to try it elsewhere or on a specific task. Once they used it, they would slowly log in and ask away when they came up against a challenge and now most of us have it logged in at any given time
