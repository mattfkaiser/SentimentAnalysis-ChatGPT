Lol what is wrong with you! Are you from the past?

It is astonishing how little people's imaginations run too with ChatGPT - I'm fed up with technically challenged TV presenters asking it mundane questions like 'Hello how are you' and 'What can you do', and YOUR question is like someone looking at the invention of writing, and not understanding how it can be used for anything other than a holiday itinerary.

Searching the Internet which we've all got used to, is normally us wanting to know something and finding out the answers so that we can solve the problem. 

With ChatGPT you don't search for the answer, you tell it the problem and it produces the solution. 
If you don't know how to describe the problem you can even tell it to ask you the questions to help it understand the problem sufficiently to then solve the problem. 

That means you can say things like 'be a doctor and ask me a series of questions about my current medication and health and then diagnose any symptoms and make suggestions on how to improve my overall health'. 

You could say 'I run a company that designs web pages, ask me some questions about my business and my customers and then suggest some compelling logos, a cool slogan and produce a multi year business plan to grow the business to 50 percent.'

You can say 'Interview me for a job in sales, ask me as many questions as you need to ascertain my strengths and weaknesses in those areas, give me a review and then recommend some ways in which I can improve'. 

I and my colleagues at work use it constantly - at work it will answer any technical questions and we can give it error logs and it tells us what do do. It produces policy documents, news posts, does job descriptions, interview questions and reviews candidates resumes. 

At home I record music, and I ask it for chords, lyrics. My drummer last night knew a song was in a particular tempo and that it went into a triplet part in the middle eight and we just asked ChatGPT what the triplet tempo would be so we could program it into our recording software. 

For fun my son uses it to make up questions for him, such as 20 multiple choice Pokemon quizes when we're in the car. 

I've had it write programs for me, it's clarified legal terms for me, it's helped me work out the best products to use, it's solved maths problems, I've used for family history research, to track down problems with the car, to simplify complex text, to improve the readability of some of my own documents, to write poetry, to compare products, to look up government legislation, to present recipes, to design web pages, to find particular songs that I can only remember the lyrics to, to track down movie information, to look up patents, to look up bird species etc. 

I'm not sure what it can't do.
