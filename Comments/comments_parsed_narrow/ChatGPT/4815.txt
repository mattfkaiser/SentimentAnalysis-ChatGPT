A few days ago I asked  ChatGPT for a puzzle.

It asked: "What is heavier than 1 ton but lighter than 2 tons?"

I thought hard and was sure to give the only possible right answer: "Yo mama."

It got mad and said I have to be respectful.

Me: "So what's the answer then?"

ChatGPT: "1 ton of feathers."

Me: "That's not true."

ChatGPT: "Sorry. The correct answer is: 1.1 tons."
