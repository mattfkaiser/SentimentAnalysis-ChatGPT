I have started using ChatGPT for my highschooler with dyslexia. When he is looking for answers for homework (which there is always a ton of) it is the difference between him being able to digest a quick summary, teaching him exactly what he needs to know to understand the answer, or digging through dozens of wordy websites where he has to make connections from several websites to bring information together to answer the question. Which is really really hard to do with dyslexia. 

ChatGPT, quick, specific, organized and easily readable. And he gets done with homework faster and he learns way more about the subject at hand. For him it is a tool of learning. If he learns something who cares what tool he used.
