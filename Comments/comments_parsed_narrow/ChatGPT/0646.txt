I've actually been using chatgpt for cooking for a while and it's been a game changer.





First of all the obvious benefit is 0 ads, but then you can do things like tweak recipes on the fly, get feedback about the ingredients in your cupboard and how to use them, you can get a list of recipe titles and then expand on the one you want.




I even used it to figure out how to change a spice mix into a sauce by adding a couple extra things. 




It's so good, I think older people would be into it.
