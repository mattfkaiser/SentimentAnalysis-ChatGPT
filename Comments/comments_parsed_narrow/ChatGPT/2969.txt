I love those posts. They irritate me, and I use that irritation as motivation. Each time I see one of those posts, I continue working on my personal project that might eventually generate passive income with ChatGPT. (I'm a software developer).  


Sometimes I procrastinate, or I'm lazy, or get distracted with other projects. But these silly posts get me back on track.  


Keep them coming!!!
