Wait until bug reports and when ChatGPT fails to understand where's the problem.

Currently, I have to work with some Azure Pipelines. I am no stranger to coding, but often I feel completely lost. Sometimes ChatGPT gives me contradicting advices. Or tells me I cannot do things that I later discover are possible. Or the opposite.
