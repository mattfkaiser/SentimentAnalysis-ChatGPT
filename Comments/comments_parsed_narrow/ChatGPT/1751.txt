I use Chat GPT every day. You need to give it prompts. He can STILL personalize it AND use Chat GPT. Just type in the bullet points you want it to say and it will pretty up the personalized Eulogy for you. At the end of the day, the eulogy is for everyone else. You just lost your dad! Focus on getting through the shock and grief. Your dad only cares about you taking care of YOU right now. He will be proud of you no matter what you say and how it is written. 

This reply was NOT written by chat GPT but if I were standing up in front of a crowd giving my reply while coping with mad stress and grief I would absolutely 100% have my Chat GPT assistant take care of the headache so I could cope.
