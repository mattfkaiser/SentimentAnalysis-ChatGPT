I use ChatGPT pretty much daily already.

What for?

A) Challenging my own work, looking at a problem (f.e. physics) and making sure / checking if the correct laws were applied.

B) Instead of dealing with software engineers for tiny programming tasks that would involve plenty of lamenting and loops… ChatGPT solves that hassle in an good hour.

C) Fine tuning my wording in mail exchanges. Rather than throwing mails into deepl, I throw my mail into ChatGPT and tell the AI tool to male sure that mail hits the tone… very happy with that!

D) Finding sources. Works pretty good as a replacement for google search engine. Like show me all publications that reference Patent number XYZ.
