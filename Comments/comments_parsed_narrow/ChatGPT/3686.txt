That's because ChatGPT is simply parroting the answer that said certified senior psychologist gave. Your certified senior psychologist didn't form the response as an original thought, they learn their responses to questions from material and education, which ChatGPT has been trained on. It would be like saying that a child is capable of giving the same answer to 'what colour is the grass' as an adult when the reason he knows the answer to that is because you once told him. It's completely natural. It just happens to have access to millions of somewhat aligned viewpoints that stem from the same source material that your therapist studied at school.
