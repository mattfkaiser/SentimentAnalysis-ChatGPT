There's no direct plugin, I simply copy the prompts ChatGPT gives me into the Midjourney private Discord bot channel. ChatGPT also doesn't know anything about Midjourney prompt syntax specifically, but it still works (and since ChatGPT's release of real-live Browsing, you can actually get it to read the Midjourney docs if needed).

Here's the first result ChatGPT delivered, for instance:

>**Part 1: The Rise of Nature**  
>  
>In this alternate world, nature, instead of human institutions, holds the most power. Forests grow freely, and animals move without fear. Rivers follow their ancient courses, unperturbed by dams or diversions. The humankind, instead of dominating, exists in harmony with the environment, their technology guided by ecological wisdom.  
>  
>*Image: A sprawling cityscape where towering skyscrapers are interwoven with verdant vegetation and meandering rivers, birds flying freely among the buildings.*

I added some style words to the beginning of each prompt to push it towards 1970s scifi concept art for consistency, and because I love that style so much.
