What the fuck is your problem? What biases? I literally got ChatGPT to say this and was confused as to how so I asked people. Someone gave an answer that was incorrect that debunks their hypothesis. Am I suppose to accept an incorrect answer? That's not finding truth.

And I have no biases to confirm, I wanted to know how I got this response if theirs no internet access and a cutoff date and I got that answer from another commenter here.
