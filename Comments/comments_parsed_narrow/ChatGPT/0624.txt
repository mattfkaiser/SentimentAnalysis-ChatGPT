>Why did it matter to everyone that Trump didn't refute or rebuke David Dukes endorsement? 

If you can't see the difference between expecting a man, who wants to be the leader and figurehead of a country, to reject one of the most notable outspoken racists of our time, and expecting every single muslim to publicly protest every attack done in the name of Islam, regardless of whether the attacker is from their home country or even their sect, then I don't know how much I can help you understand.

> how is what I said in any way hypocritical of Muslims 

You expect them all to publicly (and loud enough for you personally to hear) denounce someone extremely loosely related to themselves, while you yourself do not practice the same for the hateful people extremely loosely connected to yourself. 

To be clear, you shouldn't have to apologize for/denounce every school shooting, but neither should a muslims have to apologize for attacks they had no part of or connection to.

> ChatGPT should be able to make the same light-hearted dad jokes about Allah that it can make about other deities 

Yeah, sure, it would be nice if nothing was a sensitive topic, and we could all joke about everything freely. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and never will be. Islam reveres Mohammad and finds highly disrespectful any depictions and mockery of him. Many Christians feel similarly about the Virgin Mary, and, what do you know, if I ask GPT to make a joke about her being a whore, I get the same canned sensitivity response.
