It hasn't peaked yet? He just said that simply scaling it up is not a smart (sustainable) way to progress, not that it won't work. It's better to make the models more efficient as the next scale-up will likely cost \~ a billion(s) if the trend continues.

Another thing to consider is that they still owe Microsoft $10bn and 75% of their revenue + full access to model weights goes to them until that is paid off. That's potentially another incentive to make gpt4 cheaper and pay it off before training the next model.

If Bing AI siphons subscribers away from ChatGPT+, it's possible that OpenAI would essentially be trapped into paying Microsoft back forever (or giving access to future models forever).
