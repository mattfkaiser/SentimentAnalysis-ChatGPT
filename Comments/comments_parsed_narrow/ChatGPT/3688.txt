I see great potential in A.I becoming cradle to grave  life coaches/neuro-psychologists.  The "neuro" part is hugely important.  I am a full blown left handed (eye, hand, foot and auditory).  I had a formal evaluation by a neuropsychologists about 10 years ago and it involved lot of tests that Chatgpt can easily re-have me (assuming I have the hardware and or software to simultaneously run them in a clinical fashion).  

I for one, am of the opinion that chatgpt can do a much better job with neurodiverse individuals than the current slew of 90% right handed, often lateralized and unfortunately biased in both helping adult but most importantly youth patients.  I hate the word patient because in its potential (neuro psycho chatgpt), the aim should not be one of treating what is often but a construct (i.e "patient"), but rather a full blown "personal assistant" to truly KNOW how the person's brain works and advising them, both so that they know and that they ........strive..  +1.  

A.I +1 all the time. 

The +1 test if it was applied to tiktok algo's in the context of youths and their tictoc personalized feeds is no brainer.  A.I MUST help EACH individual (+1) else it should be shut down.  Neuropsychological clinically approved algorithms is KEY to achieving proper human/a.i interface/partnership for centuries to come.
