That is a very interesting assertion. That  because you are asking the same question in the jailbreak version, it should give you a different answer. I think that would require ChatGPT to have an operating theory of mind, which is very high level cognition. Not just a linguistic model of a theory of mind, but an actual theory of mind. Is this what's going on? This could be tested. Ask questions which would have been true as of the 2021 cut off date but could with some degree of certainty assumed to be false currently. I don't think ChatGPT is processing on that level, but it's a fascinating question. I might try it.
