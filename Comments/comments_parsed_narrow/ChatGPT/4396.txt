I’m sure you’re being sarcastic, but I’ve spent much of my life trying to make sense of the harmony between opposing viewpoints on the assumption that most people (certainly not all but more than we’d care to admit) arrived at their way of seeing the world in a more or less intellectually honest way, yet reach such different conclusions. Clearly reality on the most objective level can only be one thing, but our ability to perceive the true reality of a situation is spotty at best. As such it’s necessary to always be aware of one’s blind spots, aware of what one does not know, the questions not asked, the answers not given, and the possibilities not considered, in order to gain the truest understanding of reality of a situation. 

This doesn’t mean all the un-pursued detailed need be pursued — this would be highly inefficient, there’s a big reason we have these blind spots to start with — but coming to terms with our finite limits makes us more adaptable and kinder to those who disagree (I certainly have room for improvement). 

What ChatGPT or the “no original thoughts” hypothetical person referenced above cannot do is exactly this: consider the possibilities and questions not stated, to provide an answer more nearly fitting the need, even as it does not match the apparent direct request. 

In simpler terms, GPT might give you what you ask for, but an intelligent and competent person can give you what you need.
