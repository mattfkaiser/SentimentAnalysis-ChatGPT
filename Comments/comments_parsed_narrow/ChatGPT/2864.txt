You can't get in front of this. By the time anyone does, AI will be accepted as an assistance tool within secondary education. 

And even if that takes a decade, which is doubtful, the indicators of lazy students cheating will stand out.

However, a student doesn't need to have a genius level IQ to simply use ChatGPT as a research assistant, then paraphrase what it churns out.

Yeah, I know.."some" students won't put in that effort. IMO, that "some" is quickly going to become a shadow of its former self, after students begin to understand that lazy copy/paste is going to get them caught.

On top of that, you also need to consider sandboxed competitors to ChatGPT.

Take My AskAi for example. 100% offline. Fed source material by its master, and then directed to produce a finished product.

You may find a few ChatGPT indicators,  but no one can anticipate how quickly this will grow. You may not have a full appreciation for just how far it has come already.

Just sitting here, having never thought about it before, I've decided to help students write essays. I'll use ChatGPT to produce source material, then feed that to my own private AI.

As a subscriber to a popular Anti-Plagiarism option, I can run the finished product through, keeping a record in case any students contact the freelance-for-hire site for a refund.

I'm very excited. This is going to be fun. Sorry for going off course, but new opportunities always have a strong pull. :-D
