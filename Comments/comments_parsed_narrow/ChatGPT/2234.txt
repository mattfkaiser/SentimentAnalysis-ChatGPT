I've never had this experience with ChatGPT. 

If you have a paid subscription you can use version 4 instead of 3.5 however version 4 is considerably slower at responding as it's more intelligent. Generally the responses can be slower depending on the amount of work required to answer but it's quite a consistent speed. What's your current setup?
