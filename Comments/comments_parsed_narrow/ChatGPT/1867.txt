I am not sure about the Bing. It seems to me that queries are reduces to search terms and so instead of getting some "semantically dense" answer based on trained data, the Bing Chat's outcome is reduced to content from first 1-2 pages it found via regular search. Like if I ask it something, the information I get is basically content from the web page, wheres with offline ChatGPT the information I get is really synthesized from the sematic soap of the trained data. I find the ChatGPT's output more useful.
