It's stress relief when ChatGPT manages to ignore my repeated requests of no bullet points when I ask it to write a cover letter.

It can be willfully ignorant of any requests, like use British English please, make shorter (so makes longer), don't include this app/program in my cover letter, don't just include the first include the first two roles in the cover letter, don't just repeat that I did X at X, etc.

Sometimes ChatGPT is magical, sometimes it is an absolute cunt - especially when doing cover letters.

I am applying for loads of new jobs at the moment and it's been just a little more helpful than not, but also furiously annoying by ignoring requests to improve.
