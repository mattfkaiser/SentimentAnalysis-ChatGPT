Why not tell your management about the privacy risks of ChatGPT and such, and tell that there's open source models like  Vicuna-13B (that's close to GPT3.5 capabilites) that can be integrated in such a way that you guys don't have to pay for API access, and just use your own version of fine tuned GPT model. If you lay on them all the privacy and other legal issues OpenAI will face soon, they might understand your point and go for a safer choise, while giving you guys some new exciting project to be working on.
