Sorry for your loss. I'm going to try and add a perspective I don't see any comments touching on.

In 5-10 years when you remember your fathers funeral, what will you feel if you do use it, or don't? 

Will you regret not speaking from within? Will you be happy that chatGPT honored your father in a way that you just didn't have the words for during this difficult time?

As I think about this more. I think that for me personally the risk of feeling like I missed out on an opportunity to honor someone I love, good or bad, from my heart; is just too great. So I wouldn't do it.

Don't listen to me though. I would rather remember the strong burn of stumbling over my words, than not remember a polite, punctual, perfectly middle of the road speech that hits all the talking points.
