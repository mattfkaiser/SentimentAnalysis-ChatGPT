I want the original iteration of ChatGPT-4 I was working with back again. I wasn’t doing anything offensive or morally wrong. I was using it was a tool to kickstart from basic idea to having a decent template. Easily skipping *days to weeks* of work at times instead of engaging one of our automation engineers to build, test, and hand over a final completed request. The quality has significantly gone downhill and I’m starting to get similar “I can’t help you with this” when asking for certain things that it’s previously done for me.
