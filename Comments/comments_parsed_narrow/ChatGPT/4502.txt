Be careful because some IT people use VNC or remote control so they can see your desktop. Depending on how strict they are which sounds like they’re pretty strict I would just do it on your phone then email it to yourself. Depending on your phone policy at work you could probably manage something through voice if you have a smart watch.

Personally I just disabled my VNC and use incognito for ChatGPT. My IT bitched about it but he’s kinda a cuck anyways. After a conversation with him I’m sure he has no idea about surveillance beyond the level of using VNC
