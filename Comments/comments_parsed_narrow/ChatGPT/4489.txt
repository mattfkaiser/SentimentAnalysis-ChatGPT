For obvious reasons I don’t understand your work, but as a general note be careful about using it for work. All the data you enter can be read by the ChatGPT team, and there’s no guarantee it won’t end up somewhere random. We can’t use it at work, and while I’d love to be able to- it’s banned for good reason.
