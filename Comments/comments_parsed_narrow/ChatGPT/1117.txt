It depends. I'm not qualified enough to know if it's a necessary step in our education. When should we stop to write papers in class? High School? College? 

I don't have an answer to that but having attempted many universities in Europe and in North America, I definitely prefer the North American (Canadian) method of assignments/writing methods. We have an assignment and we do everything at home. But, now that we have ChatGPT4, it's a thing of the past. 

Should we embrace this technology? Of course, we should. Similarly to the Internet, this tool brings knowledge and power to people who didn't have any. Well, to some people. It's gonna be used by some and missed by others. How de we deal with that ? 

I don't have a proper answer. This changes everything.
