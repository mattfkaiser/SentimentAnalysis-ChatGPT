I think it depends on how you define what is revolutionary. 

I am totally with you that it is very early in the cycle. I mean, chatgpt hasn't been out that long. I also started with the sense that it was a parlor trick and now it is nitro for my work. 

Unfortunately, the tech company's space here in the US has evolved to live and die by hype. "Revolutionary technology that will change the world." Changing the world happens over time. 

I started a project on a new framework and language for which I used chatgpt heavily to ask questions and so forth. By my estimation in similar circumstances, it reduced the time it usually takes me between 65% to 75%. For me, that is pretty revolutionary. 

I get that it is still not this star trek computer where you can ask it to derive answers from first principles but it already has an impact on the amount and quality of work. I think that is important. The hyping smears an already good narrative imo.
