Exactly. Iâ€™ve been telling people this nonstop ever since I woke up to it recently. Google sucks now. The web more or less sucks now. Everything is ads, clickbait, seo crap trying to monetize and sell all the time, all the time. Using Google is exhausting, depressing and frustrating. Took years of the slow boil to become conscious of it, but a turning point has definitely been reached. 

Chatgpt is staggeringly useful in so many ways. $20/mo is a great value for it. I go to it over Google almost all the time now.
