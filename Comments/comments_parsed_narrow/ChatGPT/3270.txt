You know those videos that show size comparisons of stuff in space? Starts with Earth, zooms out to show Jupiter and how much bigger than Earth it is, then the sun,  then some huge ass stars... At the end,  the sun is a pixel compared to the biggest known star, and the Earth doesn't even register. 

I think of ChatGPT as I do the early days of the internet.  No one really used it,  and sure as hell no one could fathom what it would become and its overall impact on humanity. The difference for me is the overall impact between the internet and what CharGBT will become.  

In my example above,  the Internet's overall impact on humanity would be the sun, and ChatGBT would be that huge fuckin star.
