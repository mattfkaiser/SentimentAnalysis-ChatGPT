According to Pew Research, the number is 14% of the US *adult* population has used it.

That's just over 36 million people.


Numbers of children using ChatGPT will be difficult to impossible to get for what I hope are obvious reasons, but there are roughly 32 million children in the US ages 10–17 and given how the percent of46 each cohort who have used ChatGPT trends upward as she decreases there's no reason to suspect they would have used it at a lower rate than the youngest cohort studied 18–29 @ ~30%. That's about another 10 million people.

That brings us to ~46M US users... In *March* when the survey was conducted.

We're three months further along now. There's no way the number isn't above 60M now. New adoption will probably slow over the Summer, but I'd expect additional spikes in September and early December among users 22 and younger.

I think it's safe to get the number of users in the US will top 75M or 80M by the end of the year.
