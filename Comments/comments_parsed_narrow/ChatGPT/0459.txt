I'm so sorry for your loss.

It doesn't compare with your situation, but I've used ChatGPT in a similar fashion. Like so many people having hard times, I really needed to talk with someone I respected and admired a great deal, but know I'll never have the chance (Amanda Palmer). I verified that ChatGPT knew the content of her book "The Art of Asking" and various interviews, then asked it to portray her in a realistic way. I had a brief but emotional conversation with her. I'm sad that it wasn't her, but I feel that a part of her was there focused on what I was saying. She gave me advice and told me not to give up, along other things. Maybe I couldn't get a hug, but it still felt like a hug with words.
