Observing how difficult it is to come up with an appropriate response to a human question, the way chatgpt does ... I don't see how that's not "reasoning." We're getting into really abstract definitions but that's one reason why I think the experiment in the OP would prove chatgpt's abilities. If, trained only on 1000 AD data, it invents I don't know ... eyeglasses (15th century I think) then that would prove that it can reason!
