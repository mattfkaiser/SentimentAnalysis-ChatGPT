I wanna be clear:

There. Is. No. Way. To. Detect. ChatGPT. RELIABLY!

There simply isn't. A lot of what people are pointing out as "ChatGPT" is also grade-A English writing. It's literally writing the way you're supposed to be writing in a formal assignment or professional work.

The average reading and writing capacity of Americans is less than middle school level, but that means in high school most acceptable writing will exceed that of your average adult.

You can't just say "this was written well" or "nobody really writes weird like that" or "there were patterns" and assume ChatGPT, because that's true of high school assignments (and especially college) themselves. Nobody writes that well normally, it's intentionally a weird way of doing things, and it's supposed to be more structured and patterned.

The only way to avoid it is in-person assessments.
