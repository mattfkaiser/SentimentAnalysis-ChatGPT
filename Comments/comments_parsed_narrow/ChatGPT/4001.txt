"I keep telling ChatGPT, a blank slate that takes characterization instructions literally, that it's stupid. Why come it act dumb? I call it more dumb! Maybe i make it more smart by instructing it to be more dumb!"

Y'all would struggle to use a calculator in 1960.

Quit telling the AI it's dumb. It will act dumb.
