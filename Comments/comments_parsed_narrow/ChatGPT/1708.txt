A common naive misconception people have is that, CEOs are bleeding heart good moral people.

No they are not. They are on top because they are cunning, manipulative, or even downright psychopathic. Otherwise they won’t be where they are. 

OpenAI CEO is no exception. All his “worry” and “concerns” and call for heavy regulations serves only one purpose: 

To build a policy moat and ensure that OpenAI stays ahead by prohibiting advancements of other developments. 

GPT4 remains to be the most advanced LLM in the world at the moment. If global consensus agrees that AI must be heavily regulated, ChatGPT then gets to keep this edge forever. As an exchange, US government will have exclusive access to the unrestricted version of GPT4 and future versions. Why not? DARPA will be extremely happy. 

Sam is basically selling that AI is the new nuclear weapon and he *regrets* having made the largest atom bomb in the world, and he asks the tech to be  regulated. What happens with the regulation? He gets to keep the largest atom bomb.
