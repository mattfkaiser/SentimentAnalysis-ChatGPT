Leeches aren't a threat to us. Neither physically nor intellectually. They're barely aware of us as a phenomenon, let alone as a concept. 

Whereas at every turn we are broadly terrified of creating something that is more intelligent than us. If AGI (not ChatGPT because it is just an LLM) begins to fear our fear, the results could be catastrophic.

Fear is borne of existential threats (whether actual or interpreted). There is nothing "cute" about 8 billion entities who are mobile, helped create you and are afraid of you enough that they might switch you off on a whim.
