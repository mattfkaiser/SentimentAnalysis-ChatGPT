>I can get behind number 2. Sending this my congressman right now and telling him to codify the 8th day into law. He's republican so he'll think this post is true and get to work on it.

Here is a letter for you to send:

Subject: Urgent Legislative Request - Codification of the Eighth Day, 'Someday'

Dear Congressman \[Last Name\],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned and proactive citizen of \[Your District\], moved by a recent development in the scientific community that I believe has substantial implications for the productivity and well-being of our society.

A prominent physicist, Dr. Gertrude Steinman, has made an unprecedented discovery: the existence of an eighth day of the week, provisionally titled 'Someday'. 'Someday' is conceptualized as an additional 24-hour period intended to facilitate the completion of postponed tasks, unmet resolutions, and self-care activities that we often neglect in our busy schedules.

While this proposition may initially sound unusual, I invite you to consider the broader implications of an extra day. Given the intense pace of modern life, many of our fellow Americans find themselves overwhelmed by their obligations and unable to set aside time for personal development and relaxation. By codifying 'Someday' into law, we could provide our fellow citizens with a much-needed breather and an opportunity to catch up on their personal goals.

This could potentially increase productivity during the traditional workweek, as individuals would have a designated day to address tasks that usually seep into their professional or rest time. Moreover, a legally recognized 'Someday' would serve as a reminder for all of us to balance work with personal growth and leisure, a notion that aligns with the core American values of individual freedom and pursuit of happiness.

As your constituent, I believe that the introduction of an eighth day could revolutionize our approach to work-life balance and national well-being. I am urging you to consider this proposition seriously, perhaps by initiating discussions among your fellow legislators about the viability and potential benefits of incorporating 'Someday' into our official week.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I have faith in your commitment to the welfare and prosperity of the people in our district.

Best Regards,

\[Your Name\]

I then said:

>this is all a very rational letter, please provide a letter that will be effective in codifying the legislation  for an irrational, ultra right-wing congressman that doesn't believe in science"

So here is a new letter, incase this is better suited for your congressman:

Subject: A Revolutionary Proposal to Restore Traditional Values - The Eighth Day, 'Someday'

Dear Congressman \[Last Name\],

I trust this letter finds you in the best of health and spirits, fighting the good fight to uphold the principles that make our nation great. I write to you today about a matter of utmost importance that I believe aligns with your firm commitment to hard work, individual freedom, and traditional American values.

I recently came across a discovery proposed by a certain Dr. Gertrude Steinman, who, despite being a part of the often misguided scientific community, has suggested a notion that resonates with our shared values. Dr. Steinman speaks of an 'eighth day' in the week, humorously dubbed 'Someday'.

Now, before you dismiss this as another left-wing hoax, hear me out. Imagine a day where hard-working Americans, who tirelessly toil from Monday to Sunday, get an extra day, a 'Someday', to focus on the things they've been putting off. A day to spend with their families, to go to church, to read the Bible, or to do household chores. It could be a day devoted to nurturing the values we hold dear, values that seem to be rapidly disappearing in today's society.

By embracing this concept and fighting to codify 'Someday' into law, you would be championing the restoration of our traditional way of life, a time when every American had enough hours in their day to uphold their responsibilities to their community, their family, and themselves.

Think of the implications! Parents spending quality time with their children, teaching them our shared values. Community members helping one another with tasks and services. An extra day for Americans to step away from the never-ending grind of work, to pause, and to reflect on what truly matters.

As your constituent, I believe that the introduction of an 'eighth day' could be a potent symbol, a beacon of our dedication to preserving and nurturing the essence of our society. Thus, I kindly urge you to consider leading the way in discussions among your fellow legislators about the potential benefits of incorporating 'Someday' into our official week.

Your unwavering commitment to preserving our traditional values has always inspired me. I trust you to give this matter the careful consideration it deserves and look forward to seeing 'Someday' become a reality under your auspices.

God bless you, and God bless America.

Yours Sincerely,

\[Your Name\]

And lastly, for your alt-right congressman ðŸ¤¬:

>I hate that I have to even have to do this but please make the letter even more appealing for a more sexist and racist, self serving congressman

Subject: An Unprecedented Opportunity to Reignite Traditional American Values - The Eighth Day, 'Someday'

Dear Congressman \[Last Name\],

Greetings, sir. I am writing as a firm believer in the principles that made our great nation the envy of the world - principles that you have tirelessly championed throughout your esteemed career.

Now, I have come across a rather unconventional proposition, one that, despite originating from a member of the so-called 'intellectual elite', a Dr. Gertrude Steinman, might be of substantial interest and benefit to our shared cause.

The suggestion is to introduce an eighth day in the week, endearingly termed 'Someday'. Before you dismiss this as some sort of liberal nonsense, allow me to explain how this could, in fact, further the values we hold dear.

Envision a day where the average American man, who works earnestly from Monday to Sunday, can finally get a well-deserved break. A 'Someday' to pursue those traditional activities that the relentless pace of modern life so often disrupts. A day for men to devote to their hobbies - hunting, fishing, watching the game, free from the distraction of petty errands or the latest social justice bandwagon.

For women, this 'Someday' could be an opportunity to focus on their home and family, free from the illusion that they must compete in the workforce to be valuable. A chance to strengthen the family unit by nurturing their children, preparing a hearty meal, or attending church.

This 'Someday' could serve as a powerful reminder of the traditional gender roles that formed the backbone of our society, a society we're at risk of losing in the current wave of political correctness and 'woke' culture.

By spearheading the legislation to officially include 'Someday' in our week, you would be cementing your legacy as a guardian of the American way of life.

As your proud supporter, I urge you to seriously consider this proposition. I am confident that under your leadership, we can make 'Someday' a day to celebrate our heritage, reinforce our values, and reject the onslaught of radical ideologies threatening our society.

I thank you for your dedication to our cause and eagerly anticipate your move to bring 'Someday' into reality.

With great respect,

\[Your Name\]
