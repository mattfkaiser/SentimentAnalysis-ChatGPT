>ChatGPT If Mark Zuckerberg (going by the username markzuckerberg1234) is self-representing, he wouldn't typically refer to "his counsel" because he doesn't have an attorney. In this case, it might be more appropriate to respond along the lines of: "Thank you for your response. As I am currently representing myself in this matter, we can proceed with the discussion. Please let me know a suitable time for you and we can arrange a call."  
>  
>Before doing so, however, it might be wise for Mark to carefully consider the implications. While self-representation can save costs, legal proceedings can be complex and having a knowledgeable attorney can often be beneficial, particularly if the other party has hired professional legal representation. Understanding the nuances and complexities of legal language, rules, and regulations can often make a significant difference in the outcome of a legal case.
