>You missed the point. Grading is about evaluating how much a student understands the subject matter, not how intelligent they are or how well they ask ChatGPT questions

Grading serves a lot of functions, and good teachers will realize that. Grading isn't just for assessment, it's an opportunity to provide feedback, it's a motivational tool to incentivize students to learn or pursue new ideas, it's a tool for benchmarking a classroom to see where the teacher needs to focus more, and more. 

And there are ways of grading and ways of structuring assignments that ChatGPT won't help with. Teachers need to spend this summer rethinking how they assess their students. They shouldn't think their old ways are still appropriate in this new environment.
