Hey u/nerdninja08, I'm a graduate student working on publishing a research paper analyzing the user trends and behaviors of chatGPT and other generative AI tools in the summer, and am getting close to the finish line. I'm in the process of gathering insights from chatgpt users to help solidify the data analysis. It would be of great help if I could get your input on your usage of chatgpt,  how you view it in comparison to other services,  what makes you pay for it, and what your levels of usage (queries/day) and types of queries are. Only the aggregate metrics will be used for paper findings and the data will be completely anonymized.
