Since I began to play with ChatGPT I have learn to not thrust anything she says unless I have previous and enough knowledge about the matter. The lack of sources, the almost total uncertainty of recent information (wich gets worse with my next reason) and GPTs continuous behavior of making up things when she has no clue makes it highly unreliable to use it as a google search on steroids.
