I tried this on a blog entry I had it write a template for and then heavily edited: 

"GPT: The author of this blog entry is not specified.

\-I'm trying to check if it was written by AI

ChatGPT

Based on the language and structure of the blog entry, it is possible that it was written by AI. The use of technical language and the lack of personal opinion or anecdotes suggest that it may have been generated by a language model. However, without additional information or context, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether or not the blog entry was written by AI.

\-So you don't remember parts that you've written for me? It is partially generated by you

ChatGPT

As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to remember previous interactions or conversations. However, it is possible that some of the language in this blog entry or other responses that I have provided may have been generated by me or a similar language model."
