I think that a large part of the figure that we have, for 1 in 20 has to do with a few factors - 

Factor 1 - Distribution of Information across the continental US. 

It’s no secret that there are places in the US, that receive or rather use new information at slower rates than others. These are often more rural environments and therefore I believe we can attribute a fair amount of people not finding it useful because of that.

Factor 2 - The nature of applying AI to your workflow is still not clear to many.

I have experience with this one. It took me a long time, to be able to fully and more importantly - in an optimized fashion, use AI for my work. Often most people don’t even realize that they can relegate a lot of tasks to AI, and therefore miss out on the optimizations. For me at this point, ChatGPT acts like a second brain and greatly expedites all my workflows, but for your average person, the time investment to find these optimizations are perhaps too burdensome to achieve.

Factor 3 - Some jobs just don’t need it!

Understand that many people are not going to see chatGPT, as a tool that can greatly optimize even the home life and therefore are mostly going to look at it, from the perspective of work. A person who works a mostly manual labor job will likely have less need for AI at the workplace than say - a data analyst or engineer.
