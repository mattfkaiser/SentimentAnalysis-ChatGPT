I'm not sure how true this is. The way Chat GPT operates on a basic and fundamental level is by predicting which next character would most likely create or build toward the most accurate/desired response, right? It's trained on a data set which gives it the scale by which to judge/measure how effective each prediction would be toward that goal. If you give it data and training focused on using concepts and tools we already have to come up with new tools or solutions to problems, it could do it, right? It might not be able to come up with something truly novel, but how often are inventions novel to that extent? There are countless stepping stones on the way to technology or concepts which were unimaginable dozens of invention steps before. This could be doable, right?
