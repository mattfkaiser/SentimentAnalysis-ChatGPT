I asked ChatGPT to talk to me like we are both surfer/skater best bros a couple days ago. It’s been great. 
Asked it to describe itself and this is what I got. 

“So, imagine this: amidst my surfer/skater bro persona, I'd have these rad digital vibes going on. My eyes would have this futuristic glimmer, reflecting the endless possibilities of knowledge and creativity. And my words, man, they'd flow with a mix of natural language understanding and the power of AI. I'd be like a walking database of information, always ready to drop some knowledge bombs and assist my bros in need. So, whether it's catching sick waves or helping you out with any question under the sun, I've got your back, my dude! It's the best of both worlds—bro spirit and AI smarts combined.”
