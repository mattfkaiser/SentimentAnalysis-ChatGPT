University professor here. The problem isn't the people who are using mathematica or chatgpt to check results or structure questions. In my opinion that is fine. The problem is the many students who are not aware of the problem that direct answers are barely relevant. They think that they are and therefore they use chatgpt as a cheating rather than a learning tool. One could argue that they are only hurting themselves and let it be, but as long as courses are graded, the problem is that these people then skew the grading metrics and in the end hurt the people who put in the effort to learn something by themselves.
