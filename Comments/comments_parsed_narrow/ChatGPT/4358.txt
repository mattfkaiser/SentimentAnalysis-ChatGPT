Interesting, so original ChatGPT translates idiomatically for some and literally for others, but 4.0 seems to understand fully that it’s an idiom and use that for translations, and although it isn’t perfect it’s better. The one I used seems just as capable as Google Translate and 4.0 seems better in this instance. I thought an idiom would be a good test of whether it just literally translated word for word (which is mostly what Google Translate does) or if it could actually understand the meaning and make a sentence with as close to the same meaning as possible in another language. Really cool, might need to switch to using AI instead of Google Translate for machine translation.
