I’ve just run all of my essays, including some work that hasn’t been published yet, and nothing was flagged as ‘written by chatGPT’.  
  
Maybe an odd case of model overfitting? Too many people asking (whether from an academic perspective or from a panicked student one) whether it’s written something to the point where the model now flags it has written it.
