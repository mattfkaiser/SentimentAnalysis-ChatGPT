I don't know how many times I have to say this to people, USE THE API. Do you expect them to really give you the keys to the castle via a free chat service? They is reasons its the way it is, mostly being that youths use it, so this is why it's limited,the snapchat prompt for 'myAI' proves this, they don't want some kid sat making a waifu or whatever they are called.  Using the API gives you much more freedom, develop an app to suit your needs, otherwise, you're beating a metal wall with a wooden spoon.  For those who don't know, you get $18 for free (or might be 5 now) try it out, give it a prompt (bare in mind it responds to user start up prompts better than system, system is more for feeding web searches back in and semantic searches) and see how it reacts, if it meets your needs, keep it private for your work and pay as you go. ChatGPT website is to show off what it can do, the API is for building products. It's as simple as that and the faster people start to comprehend this we can get past this whole 'it doesn't do as I want it to'
