I think that they are saying suffering is a linguistic concept that captures the qualia of pain/discomfort. An AI could "produce" the linguistic concept of suffering without having/experiencing the qualia of pain/discomfort.

If suffering is a linguistic epiphenomenon, then ChatGPT could be capable of suffering. Of course, its easy to get tangled up in semantics.
