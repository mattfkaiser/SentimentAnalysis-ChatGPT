I was attending an hackaton in Switzerland back in March. Wasn't sure if ChatGPT was allowed or not (everybody was using it tho, and we were like 400 partecipants). After a grand total of 42 hours of consecutive work and 6 of sleep, all of that done in a foreign language and environment, my brain was basically refusing to work. And I had to write a three pages long technical paper.

So I opened ChatGPT, asked it to write the paper, then asked to rewrite the output as it was written by a human. First AI check, and none of the online tools was able to give a lower score than 99% written by a human. I then reviewed the paper, made the appropriate adjustments, and the score went down to 100% human written on every tool, chatgpt included.

One thing I noticed is that the only tools that give a suspect rating are the ones that are made to flag every content as AI written to boost their sales. So, OP, your teacher is most likely running a faulty program. Apart from the Bible, which is not meant to be an essay, try different works by contemporary-modern authors. Try novels. Research papers. Your teacher's mails and whatnot. Chances are that you'll find more false flags than not.
