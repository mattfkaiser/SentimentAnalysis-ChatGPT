Because most teachers don't know how to use it/ don't have a way to evaluate the student using chat gpt. This has happened every time a new tech comes out, it happened with calculators, pcs, it happened with Wikipedia, the internet, Google, hell it Even happened before all of this existed because the student would ask it's parents for answers. Once they realize that chatgpt is going to be a normal part of our Life (like all of the previous "new techs") they Will find new ways to evaluate the students that can overcome the use of chatgpt.
