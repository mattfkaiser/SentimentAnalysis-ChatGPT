Yeah, and most of ChatGPT’s story involves things that are, implicitly, already part of the Turing test.  For example, the “emotional Turing test” is something that could already be done within the standard Turing test.   If you were administering the (classic) Turing test, you’d try things that might trip up a computer, such has having it respond appropriately to emotions.  None of this (with the possible exception of the one about creating art) is actually moving any goalposts.
