I’ve found it to be very useful for 
1. Programming. Especially improving iteratively upon existing code. Or explaining what certain sections of code do. 
2. Cutting through parts of Google that have become mired in SEO-optimized sites with tons of ads. For example, when I want to cook something I don’t usually cook, I ask GPT to give me a quick X recipe. Normally recipe sites are designed with a ton of ads and force you to scroll forever just to find the ingredient list and instructions. All the top recipe hits on Google results are designed this way because they’ve been catering to a world where people Google everything. Now it’s so much easier. ChatGPT, tell give me a quick recipe for a fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tagine. Cardamom blondies. Anything really, it just gives you a list of ingredients and steps you need to do. No scrolling. No ads. Expand this from cooking to most things you would normally Google for instructions. 
3. Summarizing complicated things into layman’s terms. For example, reading a patent application and telling me in more basic terminology what something does. 

I feel like I’m still finding new uses for ChatGPT every few days. Auto-GPT could be another revolution but I’m having a hard time setting it up. But it’s still new to me. But honestly, I do think ChatGPT will replace Google as the place people go to for answers and solutions to things.
