Software developer here. Tonight, I decided to start learning SDL in C++ with CMake to build it. I had ChatGPT generate CMakeList.txt, and a .gitignore suitable for this project. I then asked it for C++ SDL code that would draw a window, and give every pixel a random color, updating every 1/24th of a second. It worked the first try. The only problem I see is that itâ€™s sleeping 1/24th second instead of showing a new static image on that interval. This is insane.
