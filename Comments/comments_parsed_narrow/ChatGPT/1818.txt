Sorry for your loss. I wouldn't just tell chatGPT to "write a letter that I can read at my Dad's funeral".... I would say "write a letter that I can read at my Dad's funeral that includes..." 

So give it some extra information to include like how your dad used to take you to baseball games or that he taught you some valuable life lessons or something like that. So think of all the things you want to say in your speech, and just have chatgpt write it all out so that it sounds good. And don't tell anyone you used chatgpt because some people get really weird about that kind of stuff. But if you personalize it rather than just getting it to write something generic, I think that's totally fine.
