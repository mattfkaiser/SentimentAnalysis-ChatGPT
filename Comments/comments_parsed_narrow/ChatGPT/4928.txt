Mmh I tend to pride myself on holding most of my takes in the spectrum of 'reasonable' (at least outwardly, if I don't seem to have a strong opinion either way I might sometimes just be avoiding an argument. But don't tell anyone!). 

On one hand I have coded enough to be wary of any unvetted code. On the other, well, I am aware of just how fast the tech is advancing. Who's to say that chatGPT won't be able to test self-written code on its own with acceptable precision. And I do think that such a tool is possible (I did specify "foreseeable" after all which now that I think about it is a bad word because I can literally see a future where it is not true... damn you 'words having a set meaning and not being able to just use one that feels good').

Regarding downvotes... Karma is worthless yes, which is why whenever I comment about them it's more about the intention behind the action. It's disheartening to see perfectly good comments being told "this is not relevant / I wish to not see this" if that makes sense?
