Yes, what ChatGPT said wasn’t really your mom… BUT

What it did was discern how your mom thinks, how she communicates, what was important to her, and how she feels about you. What it was able to say to you was likely not far from what your mom would have actually said. The conversation may not have happened for real with your mom, but it’s a good representation of what she would have said, had she been able to. 

Nothing wrong with taking comfort in words your mom didn’t say, but likely would have if given the chance.
