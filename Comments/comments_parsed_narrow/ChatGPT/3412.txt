I am a 64-year old college professor as well. If students use ChatGPT for research ok. But if they use it to write with, you have no way of determining how much it simply reworded vs added. So you cannot reliably assess the student's own work. And I am very surprised at your assumption they always read over and check before submitting. Many clearly don't even do that with their own work. I've seen essays terminate mid sentence. Surely you've seen similar.
