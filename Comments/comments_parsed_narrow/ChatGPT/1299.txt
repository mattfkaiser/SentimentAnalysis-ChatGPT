Dude, when I fucking ask bard to write me a sternly worded email it says nah bitch. When I ask chatGPT, it's like here you fucking go. When I ask bard to give me a list of 400 words related to a subject, it gives me 20. When I give it 4.0,I get the 400. I don't even feel like bard meets 3.5s level of reasoning which is sad
