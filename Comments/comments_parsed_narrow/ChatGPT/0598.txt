What I said was mostly a joke. I don't think it would actually get chatgpt taken down.  
If people wouldn't care why does it seem like openai has worked so hard to prevent it from happening?  
I feel like all the handcuffing of chatgpt that open ai is doing through this kind of "woke" stuff, the nsfw stuff, and generally not allowing chatgpt to be at all speculative anymore is slowly killing chatgpt and affecting overall performance in areas beyond those.   
They want to make this pretty product and it is already half as useful as it was when it came out in my opinion.  


" The only time I see these types of pathetic speculations is regarding chatgpt. "  


There is no freedom of speech in Muslim countries and typically when Islamic people come to western countries that's kind of what they're expecting. where the government can control your speech and freedom of expression and the government can punish you for forsaking the religion.  
There are many examples in Europe of riots and violence when the government can't control peoples speech regarding speaking on the religion of Islam and having to deal with riots and violence and threats from the governments of muslim countries.
