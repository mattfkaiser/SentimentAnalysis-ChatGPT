My very favorite right now is "Please organize and provide more information on the previous notes using headings and subheadings, and using bullet points - do not have an intro or conclusion as it is part of a growing list of notes â€” needs a lot of detail. Do not mention "speaker." Please incorporate examples given within the notes (i.e., do not create a separate section for it)."

I use this after I read a summary or anything really from ChatGPT. If I'm seeking more information on what was said, it'll organize the original source into PPT style notes.
