Chatgpt has been a lifesaver on my diet. I've been on keto since January and have used gpt for the vast majority of my recipes. It's also nice getting it to toss me a keto main dish and non keto side dishes for the rest of the family. 

47 pounds down and it doesn't feel like I'm dieting. I just made keto tamales, something I thought would be impossible.
