I mainly use it at work. 

It helps with things like rephrasing emails / slides to help them be more professional and flow better. 

I sometimes copy large amounts of text into it and ask it to summarise for me, which is really helpful to get through content I don't have time to read. 

It can be really helpful for generating ideas. Or even coming up with an approach for how I should do things. It gave me steps I should take to do a particular type of analysis. 

And it's incredible for learning a lot of information about a topic very quickly. For example, my boss asked me what I thought of the balanced scorecard they developed. I have no experiences with scorecards but was able to ask ChatGPT what to look out for and where weaknesses occur.
