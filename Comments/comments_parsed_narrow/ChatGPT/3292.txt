Well that's what I did. You can read in my other response that ChatGPT will just do it less often, so I had to collect all the stupid transition words/phrases and create a prompt instruction that exhaustively lists them to not be used at all. Took about 3-4 attempts, but it did work in the end. However, ZeroGPT told me that a human definitely wrote all of it. Whether ZeroGPT is wrong or if OpenAI hired someone to type out responses just for me in realtime, I'm not sure. Nor do I care.
