I recall the first few months and years of the internet. Waiting minutes to see a pixellated picture of a cat appear was not revolutionary, it was interesting and nothing more. ChatGPT in mere months of release is already my right-hand man - i have two windows of it open all day every day. There is no comparison at all - the internet at launch was a toy, chatGPT is a powertool right now.
