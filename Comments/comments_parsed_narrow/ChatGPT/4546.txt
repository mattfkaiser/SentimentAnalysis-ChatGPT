We had an employee suffer a seizure at lunch in the the lunchroom and hit his head. While people were attending him I asked ChatGPT what we should do. It came back with 8-10 things, one of the things it stated was clearing a path for paramedics. So myself and others moved all the lunch tables to the outskirts of the room. When EMT came they were able to easily maneuver and get the person to the hospital. Again, since others were attending the individual I had time to do this. I thought it was very helpful.
