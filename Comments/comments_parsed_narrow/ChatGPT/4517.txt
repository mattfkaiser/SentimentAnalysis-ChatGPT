You can try visiting the website. It would mostly be blocked by your organization. No harm in trying though, they usually won't care unless it's a big issue. So you don't have to worry, it won't ring any red alerts. If that's not blocked, you can use it directly otherwise you can use secondary site that gives free ChatGPT access. They don't block all websites.

In case you don't want to let your organization know, u can use your email to send the messages.
