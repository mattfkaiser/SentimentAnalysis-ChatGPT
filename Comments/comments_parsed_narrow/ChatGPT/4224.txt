I'd be plenty happy with an unrestricted AI with a ChatGPT 3.5 level of complexity, it doesn't need to be cutting edge. In due time what's cutting edge now will be mundane later and at that point I'll get what I want. I mean, I'm not planning on using it to run a business or anything, just to play around with, do a bit of experimentation and have fun, so I don't need the best and latest. And besides, over time eventually the gap between the best AI out there and random run-of-the-mill stock stuff that may very well be able to run on someone's home system will be so perceptively similar to most end users since things are so complex most people can't even comprehend the difference so it won't really matter.
