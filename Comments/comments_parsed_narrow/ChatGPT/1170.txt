Virtually all the people I know have heard of ChatGPT. A third has tried it. And 5% of that third has tried GPT4. No shit people aren’t impressed. They haven’t used the one that is actually good.
I recently saw an interview in which Sam Altman said that before the launch of ChatGPT (back then GPT4 was already ready) he was anticipating interest in the first version, but GPT4 was the real deal that would have been a worldwide success. For some reason the opposite happened.  
Even I don’t understand why people can’t really appreciate the monstrous difference between 3.5 and 4. When 4 came out I was speechless.  
I guess people not realizing how good this is can only be a good thing for us avid users that are 10xing our previous productivity.
