My 10 year old son has speech and hearing issues which impact his reading ability. We work on lists of words, affixes and such - for things he’s struggling with he comes up with a narrative concept then I use chatGPT to write a story at his reading level including those exact words or language concepts he’s working on. He’s always excited cause it’s a story he wants to read - It’s a game changer for special needs education.
