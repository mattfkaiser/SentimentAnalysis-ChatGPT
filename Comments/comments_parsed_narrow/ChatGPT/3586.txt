Well chat gpt would just play director in this. 

You would take a piece of music, split it in half. 

Tell chat gpt what you want to see, it will make a prompt for an ai animator. 

Then you take that to kaiber.ai, load the first half of the music in.  Give it a majestic laser lion on a lone piece of land in space prompt. 
Tell it to zoom out. 

Then do the same for the second half of the music but tell it to make the tiger attack.
Then use the last frame of the first animation to use as the starting image of the second half of the music. 
Tell it to go clockwise or counter clockwise. 
Generate the second half. 

Stitch them together in cap cut.

Post on reddit. 

All free for something like this.

Many other ways. 
Maybe a pc install of automatic 1111.
Or Adobe automation fed into premiere. 

Pick your poison.
