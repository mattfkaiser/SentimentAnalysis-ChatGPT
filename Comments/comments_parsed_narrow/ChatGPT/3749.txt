I just trained Chatgpt with all of my previous essays and creative writings. Luckily I have a lot. Now, it writes like me. Though I always tell it what emotion I am feeling and want to convey as well as creating tone, etc. etc. 

Regardless, it reads just like I wrote it and the AI detectors always give it a 0%
