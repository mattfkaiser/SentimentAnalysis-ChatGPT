The distinction is those who don't understand law are not being consulted on legal advice. Chapgpt is, and regurgitates incorrect information by repeating what's popular. Or even worse, makes up sources.

People saying objectively incorrect information on Law for example, have read the wrong sources. Or haven't read sources at all.


Chat gpt reads countless sources sources, but doesn't understand that a legal legislation is a better source of information than someone waffling on a forum, then repeats what's popular. The way it learns means it can never be considered to be "understanding" anything. It's moreso utilising statistics in a way that produces good results 70% of the time.
