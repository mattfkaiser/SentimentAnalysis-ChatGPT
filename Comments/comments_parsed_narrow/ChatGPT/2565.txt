Ironically, screenwriters could be some of the best and most talented media engineers of the next generation. 

Having played with synthetic media extensively now, it really isn't as simple as it seems to use. We need agentic AI like more advanced AutoGPTs to really achieve instant high quality. And as a writer, ChatGPT is pretty good but even if it were vastly better than me (which I'm pretty sure even GPT-4.5 will be), what it lacks is those little auteur details that "make" something what I envision it being. Those tiny little details, words, and whatnot that really redefine and recontextualize scenes and even whole stories. 

Screenwriters basically already prompt engineer movies. They could really strike it big.
