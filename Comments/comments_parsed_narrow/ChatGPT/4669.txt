External long term memory systems for ChatGPT already exist. I’m actually working on them. Look into cognitive architecture. GPT is the most important tool for an autonomous agent, but it’s not the only one. AGI should be here by the end of the year. It might not be as good as a human, fast, or cheap, but it’s coming. 2 years from now and shit will be wild (artificial super intelligence) unless something fetters technological progress like extreme legislation, massive chip shortages, or a world war.
