ChatGPT is extremely good **at what it does**, but so is Google. This question feels weird to me, like asking "now that we have shoes, have you stopped wearing socks?"

I often use ChatGPT to generate ideas. Like, "you can use this matplotlib call to make the plot you want." Then I use Google to look up the documentation for that particular call and ensure that I'm using the full power of the API. (Sometimes StackOverflow links are also useful because they provide invaluable commentary as to why something is inefficient and how to fix my approach.) ChatGPT is very good at generating a solution, but it is rather bad at generating the best possible solution or the cleanest solution given the constraints of the library. It effectively summarizes documentation, it doesn't replace it.
