It seems pretty clear that it was an oversight in the training. ChatGPT clearly seems to have an underlying directive to be positive in its responses. It also is trained on the most common and relevant human responses. If these two things are in conflict it should always prioritize a positive response.  Unless it’s training doesn’t allow it to identify something as negative.  That seems to be what’s going on here.  That type of repeat emoji trolling slipped past its training and it didn’t successfully identify it as a negative response.  Attributing any intent on its part to troll you is funny and fun to contemplate. But sadly it’s very unlikely that it’s reached a point where that’s possible. Simplest answer is usually the best one.
