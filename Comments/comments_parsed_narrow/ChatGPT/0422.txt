I'm a teacher and have often used it to help with menial or creative tasks. My students profit immensely from it, as do I.

One example, is differentiation for texts and tasks, or even creating additional tasks for students if I quickly need more material. I can have ChatGPT tailor the tasks to our current theme, level as well as vocabulary.

I also use it to create lists of difficult words or technical terms for students who do not speak our language well. ChatGPT identifies words that these students might have problems with, creates a list, translation, definition, and example. And it does all this in multiple languages.

It also helps me with creating PPTs or whole lesson plans, should I ever lack good material in our textbooks or personal ideas.
