 Before I started using chatGBT, I was nervous, so I told my colleague at work that I'm worried about my privacy with Chat GPT. She laughed because she had been using it for a long time already. But now that I've started using it, I don't understand why it's a problem . Everyone logs into Facebook and their email on their work PCs. What's the difference? Please explain.
