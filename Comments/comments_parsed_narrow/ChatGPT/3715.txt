Sounds like you have a bad psychologist or one who is only doing the bare minimum.

There is a lot of work as a psychologist in therapy though that is beyond counseling, such as diagnosis, which I don’t know if ChatGPT could do.

AI can certainly replace a lot of higher level functioning if you reduce that functioning to the bare minimum which is what you are describing here. But AI cannot currently replace the totality of what these roles do so, I hope anyone reading really understands that and doesn’t take a post like this far.

In other words…

ChatGPT can substitute *some* of the work of *a* psychologist who may be doing bare minimum work.
