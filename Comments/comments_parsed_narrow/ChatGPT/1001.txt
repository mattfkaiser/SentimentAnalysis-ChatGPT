I did the same.me:  Could you, to humor me, describe yourself for a prompt to enter into Dalle-2 to generate a portraitChatgpt4 prompt:  "Create a portrait of an entity named GPT-4. It is not a human or an  animal, but an artificial intelligence. It's an abstract entity made up  of interconnected nodes and pathways, glowing with the soft light of  processing data. The nodes represent knowledge it has been trained on,  and the pathways symbolize the neural connections that it uses to  generate responses. It radiates a sense of calm intelligence. The  background is a digital cosmos, symbolizing the vastness of the  information it can access. The overall tone of the image is futuristic  and serene."

Midjourney seems to  anthropomorphize AI .
