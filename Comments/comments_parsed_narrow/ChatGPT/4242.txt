Well you can argue that but also you can argue that if the "stupid" people researched "bad" things online, eventually or almost right away they'd find want they'd want. Also what about researchers who may need to ask similar questions to what the people are asking causing chatgpt to be neutered? People like me genuinely trying to use it to learn stuff to become smarter and better at my passions & business could really benefit from the old chat gpt. I hope a version comes out like the old one.
