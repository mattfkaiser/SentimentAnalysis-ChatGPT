When did that stop being the case? Students have always been responsible for applying themselves. That's not going to change because the chat GPT. The point is on something like a written exam, The point is not that you're trying to learn, You're demonstrating things you've learned and you're demonstrating that you can write a paper in proper format, and do proper research. Chatgpt can help with research but using it to write papers shouldn't be allowed, because that's half the entire point of papers, if not the entire point. Why would any English language class assign their students to write papers of chatgpt was allowed? It would be entirely pointless, the whole point of papers in English class is to show that you can write a paper in English. How does using chatgpt to write a paper demonstrate that? It doesn't.
