People use it wrong all the time. It isn't a tool to let you do what you couldn't before as much as a tool to make your life easier when you are capable of doing the task, but it'd be labor intensive and you can broad stroke the task with chatgpt and tweak the wrong parts.  


I've always sucked at writing my resume. I hate it very much and I have trouble finding the right jargon to use, especially when I have multiple jobs with identical responsibilities. I just sat down the other day with chatgpt and condensed my resume by a page, just had it selectively choose buzz words that will be different enough from the similar jobs to make my experience look more broad and have drafted three different versions for different careers I have experience in. It took me like 3 hours from never having used it to having all that done.  


You can't let chatgpt find a quote from the right book out of the library to hand you. You gotta tell chatgpt to look in the right book for it and it will 100% of the time.
