I would say in favor of AI in general. Chat GPT is not the end all be all. And it's competitors are quickly catching up. Besides I get better answers from other ones sometimes depending on what I'm trying to ask. One of the downsides to Chat GPT is that it's so goddamn censored. 

Open source for the win!
