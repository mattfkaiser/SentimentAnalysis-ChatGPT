On point 2, ChatGPT is trained on all text. All scientific journals up until Sept 21 is part of the training corpus. ChatGPT does have a tendency to summarize answers, but it does not mean that the first answer it provides contains all of its knowledge. You can ask it to go more in depth on any point. There are studies that show ChatGPT4 to give more accurate and favored responses than doctors. Keep in mind that ChatGPT4 is far more accurate than ChatGPT3.5. I feel many of the criticisms are with 3.5.
