Hey there! It's understandable that you'd initially be impressed by someone taking the time to read your whole profile and start a conversation based on your interests. That kind of effort can definitely be attractive.

However, finding out that the person was using ChatGPT to carry the conversation for them can leave you with mixed feelings. On one hand, it's quite innovative and shows that they wanted to engage with you, even if they didn't have the energy for it. On the other hand, it can be disappointing to realize that the connection you thought you were forming wasn't quite as genuine as it seemed.

Remember, though, that people have different ways of communicating, and some might need a little help to get started. It's commendable that this person admitted to using ChatGPT when confronted, showing a level of honesty and vulnerability.

While it's up to you to decide if you want to continue getting to know this person, it's important to keep in mind that everyone has their own unique ways of connecting with others. Sometimes, the means might not be perfect, but the intention behind it can still be meaningful. Wishing you the best in your interactions! ðŸ˜Š
