I'm an educator. I use it to generate rubrics, emails, academic goals, comprehension questions.

As a dungeon master, I use it to flush out location descriptions , NPC back stories, etc. I write the big points and use ChatGPT for minor or out of the way topics that MAY come up, but I wouldn't feel disappointed if we didn't use in a session.
