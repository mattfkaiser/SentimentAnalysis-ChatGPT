I use chatGPT for my college essays and it helps a lot. For example I had an essay that I was doing "the media, fast fashion, and it's environmental impact on human health " something like that. I don't remember the title. 

It was my choice to write about that topic but I kind of underestimated how hard it would be to talk about 4 different topics and combine it into one relatively short essay. Especially when the main media topic was the tiktok haul trends which doesn't really have much research put into it. 

So I used the AI system to help give me ideas on how certain points connect to eachother. And then I would attempt to find if there was any research on what the AI stated... and if I found a valid article then I would write about the data in my essay.
