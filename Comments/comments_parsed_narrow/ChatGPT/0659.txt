I use this to show people the kind of thing chat gpt is really good at. Things that are not hard, but would take a lot of time. You can tell it to create a meal plan for a family of 4 where one person is vegetarian and another is allergic to gluten, and that your budget is $200, and please make a shopping list. Also, I have some sour cream in the fridge that I need to use so please incorporate that.
