I got Chat GPT to summarise the above because TLDR:

“I got the internet at my house in 1993 when I was a high school freshman and used it for chat rooms. Now, I'm amazed by the capabilities of AI like Chat GPT, which has the potential to simplify and streamline my job as a teacher. I believe AI will continue to develop and become a part of our daily lives, potentially solving staffing issues and creating new job opportunities.”

Couldn’t agree more, buddy
