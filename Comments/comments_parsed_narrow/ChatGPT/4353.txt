**Please translate "It's all Greek to me." into German.**

"The phrase "It's all Greek to me" translates to "Es ist alles Griechisch für mich" in German. However, this phrase might not be understood in the same way in German, as it's an idiom in English used to express that something is not understandable. A more understandable equivalent in German might be "Das ist für mich böhmische Dörfer", which literally translates to "These are Bohemian villages to me", an idiom implying something is incomprehensible or unknown."
