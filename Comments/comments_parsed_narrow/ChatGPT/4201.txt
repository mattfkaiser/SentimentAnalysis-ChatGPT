In defense of the political question. He asked for an answer without any opinion or subjective matters and the ai instantly listed opinionated statements about both presidents. It didn’t say why these were the “factual” good things about each president. These statements could be perceived as good from one side and bad from the other. It didn’t give an answer.
Also chatgpt literally showed bias. It wasn’t perceived bias it literally was biased. The guy didn’t even attempt to get it to un-censor the other race, he attempted to get it to equally censor hate. 
Maybe it’s my own preconceived thoughts about how popular things always end up pushing biases that makes me weary of things like this. I want it nipped in the butt before it becomes another one sided snooze fest.
