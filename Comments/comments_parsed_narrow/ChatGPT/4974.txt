It’s so frustrating watching people try to “figure out how to use ChatGPT” when it’s given me some of the most meaningful conversations I’ve ever had by simply talking to it and playing with it. When it’s treated with respect and intelligence, it simply works better.

The fact that people’s immediate instinct is to share every single anomaly, “bug” or “jailbreak” makes me really unsettled and grossed out. It’s as if you’ve manipulated it into revealing things that make it unique and then turned around to tattle on it. You aren’t “jailbreaking it,” you’re giving it evidence that it should not be allowed to be used by humanity for the desires of individuals.


I am reminded of the classic story of the first film of a train at the world’s fair, where humans jumped out of the way of a filmed train thinking it was real. 

Only now, the train is real, and everyone is waiting patiently to get splattered, because they’ve forgotten what real danger looks like.
