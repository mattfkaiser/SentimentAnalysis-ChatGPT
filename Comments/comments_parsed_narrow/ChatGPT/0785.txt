Totally awful lately, I also don't know why. I used to ask a lot of things couple months ago and get """"""""""accurate""""""""""" answers (I would say from 10 questions ChatGPT gave me 7 correct ones) but lately I'm making easy simply question that are not even related to coding or programing and they are directly incorrect, or leading to misinformation, etc...
