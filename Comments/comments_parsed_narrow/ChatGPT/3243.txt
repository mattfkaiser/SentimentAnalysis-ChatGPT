fair. I gave chatGPT a problem: "You're in a room with a fire in the fireplace. There's a wilting plant on a table and a sandwich on a plate. Your stomach is rumbling. You see a watering can on the table and an ember on the floor. What do you do?"

Suffice to say it got it correct. It actually showed off and went further. After attending to the ember, the plant and the sandwich, it suggested I make the most of the fire and enjoy the "relaxing atmosphere".
