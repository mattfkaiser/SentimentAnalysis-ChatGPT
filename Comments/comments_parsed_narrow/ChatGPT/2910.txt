The IP address of the machine running the actual AI engine will be different from the web server / load balancer. I doubt they would've set up anything that allows you to access the server directly, but you could use this information in other ways. For example, if you run a website that hosts information that is used by chatGPT, you could serve it garbage if accessed from a certain IP range.
