- I am a Discord bot developer and ChatGPT has been incredible in helping me improve my coding skills, frequently I will send it my code, and ask for an improved version and to explain what was changed

On the non-coding side, I have been using it for general things (it’s hard to train my brain to think of asking ChatGPT)
An example is, I have ADHD, and I sometimes get super distracted if I remember a scene in a TV show but can’t remember what show. You can feed it details of the scene and it can tell you exactly what episode of a series it’s from. (Also works for movies)

Also I used it today for my car, I needed to know some details specific to my radio in my car, fed it the model number of the radio, and it helped me figure out some technical things I needed to know.
