Using the exact question. Chat GPT is amazing but still has a bit to go.


"One kilogram of bricks and two kilograms of feathers both weigh the same, which is one kilogram. This is because the weight of an object is determined by its mass and the gravitational force acting on it. One kilogram of bricks has the same mass as two kilograms of feathers, but feathers are less dense than bricks, so a larger volume of feathers is required to equal the same mass as a smaller volume of bricks. 

However, if you were to compare the physical size and volume of one kilogram of bricks versus two kilograms of feathers, the feathers would take up much more space due to their lower density."
