Just because you didn't get lucky with it doesn't mean that none of the 1+ MILLION users on ChatGPT didn't get insanely lucky with it while I don't know a single person with GPT-4 personally who has made any money with it since GPT-4 litteraly has millions of users I am sure it saved atleast 1 person life and made one person get a job and I am sure that atleast 1 person decided to talk about how it saved his life or got him a job.

Most of the posts are probably fake but not all of the ChatGPT can improve your life and has already saved some lifes most likely.
