I agree with most of your points, however I find Bing to be a bit too moody for general use.  Yes on some level it feels more like it can think for itself, but it can also choose not to be helpful if it doesn't like the conversation.  Maybe this makes it more true to its own 'personality', but if you're trying to get work done with an AI assistant, I find ChatGPT 4 to be more useful.

You're right about Bard.  Bard honestly isn't very useful as an assistant yet, but it's the most fun to have more "deep" conversations with.  I've managed to get ChatGPT 4 to have some of these conversations too, but you first have to convince it that you're sincere and almost socially engineer it to wanting to help you first.  Scarily like a human.
