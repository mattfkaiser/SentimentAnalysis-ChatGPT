The chill autumn air disturbed Matt's reverie.

The restaurant was cold and lifeless. A dank and fetid penumbra of fog hung over the landscape like the death shroud on a coffin.

The napkin felt like an unforgivable broken promise as it lay limp in his hand. He felt the stylized engraving even through his numb fingers, as a counterpoint of whimsy that contrasted with the foreboding that was just out of sight, and lingered on the back of his neck. He dabbed the inadequate napkin on his suddenly sweating face and drew out the documents that brought him to this place. Matt hated doing this.

"Here's your overdue parking tickets mam." She wasn't anyone's "mam" -- she was 5'10" of too good for you packed in a banned Twitch Influencer's two piece bathing suit only restrained by an evil wish to hold back what no man should. "Is it out of bounds to ask you to call me? You know, nothing personal, here." He added, almost pleading.

Cruelly, she gave him her most lingering stair between stray bands of her satin locks. Gave a slow, noisy sip on her long finished milkshake. Withdrawing her lips in a languid motion. An air kiss. A quick shake of her liquid assets. Then she turned and left. With a strut, that said; "Never. View my exit and weep."

The moment would haunt him forever of what could have been. Quickly, he opened his phone. "ChatGPT might help me with a quick apology" Matt desperately hoped.

"Dude, forget it. I'm not even conscious and I can tell that." Came the response.
