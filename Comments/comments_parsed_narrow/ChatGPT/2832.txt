I used Prompt Perfect (free plugin) to craft a prompt to do my imaginary 5th grade writing assignment, specifically asking Prompt Perfect to generate a prompt to help make the essay seem authentic and avoid plagiarism concerns.

As a very lazy student, I think I could get by with just copying and pasting this. As someone who was at least smart enough to know how to cheat if that's what I wanted to do, I would use this to VASTLY accelerate my Isaac Newton article draft process, skipping the research process entirely (I could provide made-up citations of needed), probably saving me 90% of the time it would normally take to create.

Schools are only going to be able to enforce original research and writing if students are literally forced to use only monitored school devices to do their work and have a school-only research portal. Even then, some craft students will learn how to cheat.

Sure, here's a simple essay on Isaac Newton that should be suitable for a 5th grade student:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**

Isaac Newton is my favorite historical figure because of his amazing contributions to science. He was born in England on Christmas Day in 1642. Newton was a mathematician, physicist, and astronomer, and he is considered one of the most important scientists in history. His discoveries have helped us understand the world around us. This essay will explore his life and his major contributions.

**Paragraph 2: Early Life**

Isaac Newton was born in a small village in England. His father died before he was born, and his mother remarried when he was three. Newton was not a particularly good student when he was young, but he loved to read and build mechanical devices. When he was 12, he went to live with a pharmacist where he had access to many books. This sparked his interest in science.

**Paragraph 3: Discoveries and Achievements**

Newton made many important discoveries in his life. He developed the three laws of motion, which describe how objects move. Newton also discovered the law of universal gravitation, which explains why objects fall to the ground and why the planets orbit the sun. He invented calculus, a type of math that helps us understand changes and motion. Newton also made significant contributions to the field of optics, the study of light.

**Paragraph 4: Later Life and Legacy**

In his later life, Newton served as a member of parliament and was knighted by the queen. He continued to work on his scientific research until his death in 1727. Newton's discoveries have had a lasting impact on science. His laws of motion and universal gravitation are still taught in schools today. His work has influenced many other scientists and has helped us understand the universe.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**

Isaac Newton was a remarkable man who made many important contributions to science. His discoveries in physics, mathematics, and optics have greatly influenced the way we understand the world. Even though he lived over 300 years ago, his work is still relevant today. I admire Newton for his curiosity, his dedication to learning, and his ability to make such significant discoveries. Isaac Newton truly is my favorite historical figure.
