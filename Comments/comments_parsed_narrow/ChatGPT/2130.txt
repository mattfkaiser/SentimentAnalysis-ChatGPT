Why did this take so long to show up? Has no one here actually use GPT in the workplace and looked up the licensing and privacy guidelines?

For fuck's sake people you can even copy + paste them into GPT and ask it to explain them for you if you wanted.

I BELIEVE OpenAI was "opt-out" rather than "opt-in" until recently. You had to send them an email asking to opt-out.

We did that and we also built a custom ChatGPT app on top of OpenAI's APIs so that we could use it for client work without violating any contract agreements.

It wasn't that hard.
