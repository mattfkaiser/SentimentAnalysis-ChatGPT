Why are we acting like this is anything new? This is the same tired "jailbreak" as before. Tom Mega is ridiculous, will lose its memory right away. The cookie stuff won't work, since GPT-3 isn't going to prioritize keeping the cookies value high.

And what's up with wanting it to be racist/offensive? By having to mention it, you put the instructions into ChatGPT and it will just go off and be offensive. It won't come up naturally in a conversation, and it won't fill any purpose except for people to giggle because "it said the n-word lmaoo". Can someone please explain the purpose of that? Without giving me the "OpenAI is keeping free speech out of their property and we can't make edgy internet jokes with it, so we the people take back what's rightfully ours"
