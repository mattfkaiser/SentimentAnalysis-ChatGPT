Did it’s crazy I’ve seen this dude from YouTube who doesn’t have any cording knowledge but had chatGPT tell him with prompts for what kind of put frame and style game he wanted he got it to give him all the coding for each aspect neeeded then instructed to put it in the order necessary to make it work for him to actually make use and finally play at the end of it all. I can’t wait to try this when I get my new PC
