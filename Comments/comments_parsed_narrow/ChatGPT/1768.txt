I think this is a great point in that this is an issue about social acceptance.  Basically, if the norms around the eulogy were different in the sense that you mourn by yourself and then speak to the dead, people will be more lenient on what this person can and cannot do.  But the critics are putting themselves in the shoes of the participant of the said funeral and imagining themselves listening to OP talk like ChatGPT.  And they don't like it.  So the critics are making this issue more about themselves and less about the OP when it should be the other way around.
