It is a nice gesture 😊 

I agree, generally speaking I see OpenAI as a partner rather than an automation tool. I just used it to write my performance review at work. It was an incredible performance review, better than anything I could’ve written. But it did take me a good 20h of back and forth to tell it what I want and make edits. 

As for Tinder automation - well….here’s the thing. I think Tinder is extremely inefficient. You spend hours mindlessly swiping. Only to be matched with randos who are 90% not going to be a good match, have long awkward conversations with them to learn that fact, and have to deal with the ridiculous amount of competition/selectivity on the app. I met a few girls off of Tinder in real life. Because, hey I didn’t have any better options. They were even less of a match in person. 

On the other hand, in real life, I actually have had decent success. Met my partner at a retreat, through a friend. I think I’m more successful in these environments because they essentially are a massive filter for people similar to me. If they’re at these types of events, are friends with my friends, share a common interest, values, cultures, they are much more likely to be a match than a randomly chosen individual. 

So…where am I going with this…ChatGPT. Can understand who I am. Can understand who the other person is. And can probably deduce “could this actually work?” much more efficiently than wasting hours of your time swiping. 



But anyways, congrats man!!! Wish you luck 😁
