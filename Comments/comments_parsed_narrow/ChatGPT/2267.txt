If you’re using it for an email bot, make sure you create a separate instance and train it with your email writing style based on your most successful emails you’ve sent in the past. Use other instances of chatgpt for research and then formulate the summary from that. Then take the summary and move back to the email bot conversation instance to formulate it into your style of email communication language.
