I’ve sent myself to the ER three times similar to OP, except his case seems way worse than mine despite the fact I was in 110 heat riding a century on a mountain bike with a full size backpack on.

My renal function was zero, but I was discharged in less than 12 hours and my levels were never that bad.  3 bags of IV usually did it.

I’m worried about OP, honestly, because I was in my 20s and this guy is 19.  In the Army I was his age and I was unstoppable, I think we may get some bad news to come.

Maybe it’s a silver lining, MS caught early?  Treatment can make a world of difference.  Go chatgpt but seems like this kid was gonna hit this wall sooner or later.
