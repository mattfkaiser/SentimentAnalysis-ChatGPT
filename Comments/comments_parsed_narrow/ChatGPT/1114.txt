Well that explains it. The point of an ESL class isn't to teach you how to write a research paper, it's to teach you how to communicate in English. But the point of an upper-level (say) history class is to teach you how to write the kind of thing that might get published in a history journal or as a book. ChatGPT can't actually do that, since the writing it produces is boring, riddled with errors, and pretty much necessarily derivative of prior work, but it can fake it enough to fit in with other students writing shitty papers themselves.

An in-class essay isn't going to teach you how to write an academic article because they're not similar things. You won't be citing a bunch of sources in an in-class essay, for example. And in general, in-class essays aren't really supposed to be *good*, because you don't have enough time to edit them or think through your argument deeply before writing or any of the more complex work that goes into a real paper. Instead they are supposed to be displays of knowledge. But you won't get an article published by regurgitating a lot of history that other people already know.
