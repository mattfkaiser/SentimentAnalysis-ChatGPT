That's only partially true, The ability to automate labor, will reduce the demand for those positions, but as 'mundane' tasks become automated it will free a lot of people up to pursue less mundane tasks, and industries around those will 'rise up'. Eg, I am a programmer (I'm starting my own company, so at this time its me,myself, and I), usually I spend large amounts of time writing 'mundane' and repetitive code, using ChatGPT or similar I can spend less time on the mundane tasks, and can focus on more complex stuff, meaning that otherwise 'unobtainable' goals, are becoming more reachable
