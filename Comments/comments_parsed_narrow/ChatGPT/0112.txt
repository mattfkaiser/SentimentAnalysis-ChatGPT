I think that's the point. I think most people on reddit enjoy being anonymous and therefore are more honest and all parts of personality could be analyzed with AI. But still every user should have it in their own hand to connect their profile to Reddit or any social media they have. AI is a big privacy debate, otherwise ChatGPT wouldn't be banned in Italy already.
