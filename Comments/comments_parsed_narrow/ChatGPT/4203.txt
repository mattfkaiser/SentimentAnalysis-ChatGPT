Yeah the US is very much liabilities focused. There are liability forms you sign and terms of service you acknowledge for doing almost anything. There are interesting videos already on the ToS you agree to when using ChatGPT. LLM’s are such a new and disruptive innovation that I think it’s almost impossible to set any standard. The last thing OpenAI will want is to expose themselves to too much liability and have a massive backlog of lawsuits heading their way in a few years. 

A big part of it is driven by the lawyer industry. I think it’s partly because the US has less federal oversight due to its states structure and partly because there is so much wealth and lawyers are looking to get a cut as well. The lawyers go on to become politicians so the cycle tends to continue.
