Fine. It's user error. There is user error with literally everything. Ever read warning labels? Some people are just dumb. Sad fact, but it isn't going to change. So slap a 'remove child before folding' type warning label on it. You know the ones that are on strollers. But don't get rid of the folding stroller.

Warning label on chatGPT will be fine for most people, but dumb people will be dumb and you can't change it. If you strike up a conversation with chatGPT and it talks you into self deletion...well that's sad...but I don't blame chatGPT.
