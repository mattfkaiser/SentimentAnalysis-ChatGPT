Tried to use chatgpt to write thinkscript code for the think or swim trading platform. 

I do no real programming. 

Chatgpt could not code the most basic thinkscript. 
You would literally have to try to be that bad. 
Even I can code better and I cannot code. 

Absolute trash.

It also denied my request when I asked it to list out a number of narcissistic traits. However when I don't it I was a woman it gave me a long list with details. SO.  Yah. Ha.
