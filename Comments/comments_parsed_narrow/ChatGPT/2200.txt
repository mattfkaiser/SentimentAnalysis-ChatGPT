Do whatever you can to prepare yourself and your organization for multimodal integration. This will soon become the norm, and the sooner you are prepared to begin using it, the better. Start thinking of prompts that allow you to use the full capability of ChatGPT4, now. For example, it is fully possible to get it to act as a doctor (or really any role you would like, such as trained medical diagnostic) by using prompts in which you ‘role play’ in ‘hypothetical’ scenarios. Fuck the noise about legal issues and caveats and blah blah, like you said this has very real implications for people’s lives, if you are in a position to help with that using the soon-to-be superhuman capabilities of AI, then you should. I would think about how you can **anonymize** as best you can any medical data that you give to it, mostly to protect yourself.
