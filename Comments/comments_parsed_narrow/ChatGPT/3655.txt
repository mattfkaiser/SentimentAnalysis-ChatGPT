Before writing off the full field of human psychologists - Try asking ChatGPT for advice on how to solve a real problem involving something you are personally an expert in and know a lot about. I don't know your profession but, for example, as a game designer I have tried asking it to solve certain game design problems and it's very bad at it.

I've noticed that it seems far more impressive to me when it's replacing experts in fields that I don't know much about myself.
