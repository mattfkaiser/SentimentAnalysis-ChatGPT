I got the opportunity to hold a presentation to my colleagues about AI just one week ago. I work at a theological seminary and addressed AI cheating as well as how AI can increase our productivity. In short, most of my colleagues were shocked or at least very surprised by what I had to say, since most of them hadn't used AI themselves and those who had thought it was very limited. I gave several examples of how AI has improved just over the last few months and gave specific examples how it can be used to ease our and the students' workloads.

I'd recommend you give some live demonstrations of what's possible with ChatGPT Plus when it comes to GPT4, browsing and plugins. Also talk about how the quality of the output relates strongly to the quality of the prompt . Most people who underestimate AI have used bad prompts for half an hour or so. Of you show them all this, my guess is that their mind will be blown and that they would want to think about how to use this in their specific tasks - you could ask them to talk in smaller groups about that.
