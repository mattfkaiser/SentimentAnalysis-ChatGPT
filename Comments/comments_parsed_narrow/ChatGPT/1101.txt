I just tested it - i got chatGPT to write a story about a young dragon and a viking boy - zerogpt said 47% AI-written.

I then asked chatGPT to rewrite the story so plagiarism detectors couldn't tell the story was written by an AI and pasted in the new text.

Now, zero-GPT says it's 0% AI-written, 100% human written.
