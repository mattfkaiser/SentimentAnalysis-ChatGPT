I checked out your post on Twitter really great stuff, new subscriber! 
So from talking to its creator Francesco, my C64 is not connecting directly to chat GPT …when I dial into his BBS and authenticate under the chat GPT page my C 64 interacts with his retro campus BBS server, which then interacts with chat GPT . So the BBS is just a middleman between my machine and his chat GPT account ….that’s why it’s for Patreon Subscribers only. In the description on my YouTube video  I have more links to Francesco sites.
