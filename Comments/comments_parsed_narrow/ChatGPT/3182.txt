It’s definitely in the prompts. This is not related to contracts but I asked it about beat matching songs as a dj. Initial prompt was how do you mix a song that doesn’t start on the downbeat or 1 beat? And then I asked about the song sexy back by justin Timberlake. I asked what beat it starts on. It came back saying it starts on the four and beat. I created a new chat the next day and asked without prompting about beat matching songs. It told me the song starts on the 1. I told said you told me prior that it starts on the four and. Chatgpt said nope. It starts on the 1. Don’t know what you’re talking about. I created a new chat yesterday and prompted it again that I was asking about beat matching songs that don’t start on the 1. Then asked about the song sexy back by justin Timberlake and it said it starts on the four and beat. 🤷🏽‍♂️
