As a professor, I try to avoid giving written projects. But some times I allow myself to give them a project where they have to use their own judgement to apply their knowledge and they have to justify their response. That way even if they use chat gpt, you are forcing them to understand it enough to be able to defend using that answer. 

If you can do it entirely on chat gpt, then just take a minute to rewrite it yourself and sound more stupid as humans (specially undergraduate students) usually do.
