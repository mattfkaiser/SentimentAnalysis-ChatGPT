I just had a similar experience. I was going through a mental breakdown at work (I usually use ChatGPT4 for my work anyway) and I didn’t realise I’d ranted to GPT4 about what I was going through with my boss. GPT4 then flagged signs of gaslighting and abuse and proactively described the steps I should take in order to seek help/navigate the situation more strategically. Unlike most therapists I’d seen who were painfully superficial and uttered things like “relax, breathe in and out”, GPT4 actually validated my feelings and told me ways to mitigate my situation. It’s astounding. 
I don’t know how but I instantly felt better after its response. And in my mind I was thinking of the uncanny parallels between GPT4 and an actual therapist.
