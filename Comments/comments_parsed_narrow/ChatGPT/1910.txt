ChatGPT isn't a reference, it's a language model. If you're going to ChatGPT for your queries you are accepting falsities or at a minimum non contextual information.

I do things with ChatGPT I couldn't fathom of doing before, but it's been an additive feature, not a replacement for traditional, sourced material.
