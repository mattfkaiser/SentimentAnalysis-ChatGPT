I just checked with ChatGPT and it claimed it wrote part of my dissertation. 

That I wrote in 1998. 

AI detection is garbage and ChatGPT lies all the time. I would push back and show all the work you have done. You should have sources and if you used Google Docs, you should be able to show the version history of the document you worked on.
