You’re not an attorney, so how it “sounds” to you isn’t terribly relevant.

Your description of what “my entire profession” is also makes it clear you don’t know what you’re talking about. A good part of my job is writing, the other substantial part involves oral advocacy that is too situational for ChatGPT to handle for the time being. 

ChatGPT will improve, and it already can do a lot with the practice of law. It’s still dumb to trust it completely without being able to understand what it is saying.
