I wasn’t around for the internet boom unfortunately, but I can comment on what I see with ChatGPT/ AI. I think it has the potential to become more significant, although that may come down to how regulated it becomes to the general public. However, at this point, the cats truly out of the bag. I don’t see any way they can put the cat back IN the bag after it’s given birth to hundreds, maybe thousands of others.
