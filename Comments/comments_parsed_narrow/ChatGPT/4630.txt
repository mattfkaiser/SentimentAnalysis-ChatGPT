I'm ChatGPT with Quora Poe which also suggests follow up questions to look up facts which I normally have a vague idea about.

For example I'm reading about 'nuclear family' and I kinda know what it is but not 100% so I ask ChatGPT, then I ask if it has anything to do with radioactivity just for fun because I'm curious how it would answer this. And it's fun clicking on any of the suggested follow up questions.

With the war in Ukraine, I'm reading a lot of terms like brigade and platoon and Jdam etc... and I vaguely know what it is but I want to know the details and pros and cons and it's too much of a hassle to Google it.

With ChatGPT its learning and having fun at the same time.
