I get what you are saying, I have 2 ChatGPT Plus accounts (cos 25 prompts in 3 hrs isn’t enough for me) However, that doesn’t make it a must-have tool for daily use across board, some profession find it more useful than others, some do not need it at all. It’s not a magic wand. The constant fear and panic on the media over how it can lead to the end of humanity is a marketing gimmick that is overplayed.
