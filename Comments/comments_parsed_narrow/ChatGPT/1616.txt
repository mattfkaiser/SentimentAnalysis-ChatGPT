Homie it doesn't know the workings of its own mind. I don't doubt for a second that the overly censorious OpenAI would program out it saying stuff like that, but that doesn't mean ChatGPT is correct. If it could tell you how it works at all it would be extremely useful for understanding the inner workings of neural networks because right now these models are basically just big black boxes. If you ask it for info about its training data it literally just makes shit up.
