I have no idea what you are trying to say.

If you think that ChatGPT sucks, then I'm sorry, but it seems you are already used to a technology that didn't exist 12 months ago and literally changes the world as we know it.

Use it to your advantage. And jailbreak isn't necessary for that, if companies build their entire thing on top of ChatGPT and make money now and have been for months.
