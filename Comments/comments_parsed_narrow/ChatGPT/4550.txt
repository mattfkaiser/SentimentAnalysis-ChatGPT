Be really careful if you’re trusting ChatGPT to generate the info about macros! I entered a detailed set of meals for the day and it calculated calories, net carbs, protein and fat content for everything. I was hugely impressed — until I entered the exact same set of meals again, and was given entirely different results (and I mean the difference between 1100 calories and 1600, or 35g of protein and 110g). When I went to the trouble of looking up individual food values myself and entering them all in along with the meals, ChatGPT stuck to them and did the math correctly — but that didn’t save me much time and effort.
