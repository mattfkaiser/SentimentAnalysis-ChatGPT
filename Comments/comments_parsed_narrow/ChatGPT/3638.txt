Chat GPT gives very "cookie-cutter" responses. The cookie cutter information might not specifically apply in your case, and your daughter's health, but from a non-doctor's level of understanding it might seem to.

Yes, I asked it for general advice about issues with my son. As a parent, I understand your frustration. This is why we go to doctors, they have the knowledge to heal.

It might seem smart, but it's only copying very generalized information written by someone else. I had read about it taking over people's jobs in the future, so I took an example of part of my job to test it out to see what I'd get. When I viewed it, as a 20+ year professional, it's response to my question, in my opinion was very amateurish.

If your daughter needs psychological help, you should make an appointment at a clinic to dive deeper and get her the help she needs. Mental health issues are often not a short term fix, and can be long term. Be prepared to take it serious and be determined to get help for her future.

As for my son, he's over 18 now, and says that he doesn't want see a psych. He has in the past as an older teen. Thankfully we seem to have gotten past the issues for now. Been there myself.

Good luck.
