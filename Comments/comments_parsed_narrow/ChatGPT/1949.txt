I believe Bing AI is supposed to rectify that. I don’t use it very much since it’s just ChatGPT with a skin, but it is really cool that it provides links to the sources of the information. Then it solves the snake eating it’s own tail issue Hank Green was discussing with AI. Generally, I’ll use ChatGPT to get a very general broad overview, but it’s about as accurate as asking someone in the hallway about a topic, so it’s best to just use it as a starting point.
