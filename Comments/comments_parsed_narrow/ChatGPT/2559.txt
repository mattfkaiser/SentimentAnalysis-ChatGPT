I bet Hitchcock would have loved and thrived with ChatGPT.

My understanding of his process was that he always had a notepad and pen with him. He would just coke up with random ideas for awesome scenes or shots and at the end if the day pit these scrap ideas into a jar. When the jar got full he wouid pull them out and treat it like a puzzle of how these shots or scenes could be put into any kind of meaningful order. And it was only after that he would try and write some sort of story to give it coherence.

The most brilliant and hilariously clear example of this is North By North West. Every scene was amazing and a thrill every second. The story is great because of the pieces. But "chase scene across mount Rushmore" was a piece of paper he had with no attachment to any particular story. He just thought it would be cool. And that is the highlight if that film.

Such aggressive "bottom up" development is really missing. It is like people come up with the arch and then stuff in filler to get from Ike place in the story to the next like a high school English paper looking to meet a word limit, and then try and make it cool. You can't being so locked in.

Anyway, all to say I bet if you gave chatGPT 50 bad ass scenes and asked it to weave them together in a way to make sense according to some kind of arch, it would be very good at using logic to solve that puzzle. What it can't do is coke up with a bad ass scene. It would never imagine before someone else ever did, to have a chase scene over Mount Rushmore. It wouldn't understand why that is so cool.

I bet there were parts of that puzzling together for Hitchcock that were dull that AI could do that would let him spend more time doing what he was actually great at.
