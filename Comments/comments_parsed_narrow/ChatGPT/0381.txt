I've tried to use ChatGPT to help me with coding something somewhat complex once. It kept getting things slightly wrong and after enough prompts for it to fix different things it started using undeclared variables and doing various other impossible things, when I bring it up it apologies and tries again but it really only got like... 85% of the way there. But it did give me some insights that led to me solving the problem.
