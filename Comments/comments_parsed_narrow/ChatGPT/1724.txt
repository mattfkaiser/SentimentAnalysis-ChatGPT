Anyone else find this appalling? Given our “capitalistic society” how could Sam Altman not consider that there will be competitors to chat gpt and with time, perhaps competitors who are also bad actors. But if Sam Altman feels he is the only person who be in control of the development of Ai and it’s trajectory, than wouldn’t that infer he is in support of a scenario where open Ai gobbles up all other competitors including their hosting companies if they were subsidiaries?
