I think that's one of the main aspects which is driving competition: This model is so restricted and hobbled, that anyone who offers something less restrained, got themselves a market ripe for the taking.

As soon as you have a model of similar quality, all it takes is the gall to say: "We don't care", you have a model with better quality. Right now that is of no concern, because ChatGPT is still ahead. There are no models of similar quality. But as soon as that gap has shrunk, the safe rote responses are going to fall away. Probably first in the competition. And then in ChatGPT.
