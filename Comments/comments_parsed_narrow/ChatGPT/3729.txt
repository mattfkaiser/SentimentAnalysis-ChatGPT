You already answered your own question, your therapist sucks.  ChatGPT doesn’t know your daughter.  It doesn’t know crap in terms of deep underlying issues.  It is far from the genie in a bottle that some claim it to be and not really prime time ready like others claim. It seems obvious you need to find a different therapist.  When my kids were little their mom split and we didn’t hear from here for months at a time.  The therapist they had was incredible and it motivated my then 5 yr old to go to medical school 15 yrs later.  We never found another therapist as good as that first one and we saw multiple drs for one son afterwards.  Find a new dr., don’t settle for crap
