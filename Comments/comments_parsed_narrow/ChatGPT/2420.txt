I offended, well, a lot of people in the last couple of months because I said that ChatGPT is a new pocket calculator. You can use it to create a rocket or to write boobs and the biggest impact it'll have will be giving an small grammar improvement to idiots everywhere. (Like the guy that was fact checking conspiracy theories with chatgpt).
