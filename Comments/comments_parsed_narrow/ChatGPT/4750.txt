The public version of ChatGPT knows statutory authority and jury instructions as of September 2021, but does not know current statutes or jury instructions. It knows landmark cases for certain rules of law. However, it does not know case law outside of landmark cases, so when you ask it to cite case law for a rule, it will name a real case with the correct citation, but that case will have nothing to do with the question you asked. If you ask it for the facts of the case, it will just make up facts. This is obviously a massive problem, which wouldn't be exposed by taking a bar exam, because you don't cite case law on the bar exam, except for landmark cases if you want to be fancy. You're allowed to just say what the rule is on the exam. But you have to cite statutory authority or case law for every rule you use in motions in court. Maybe OP is only using it to draft complaints, which are factual allegations that don't require citing law, but it's definitely not ready for wider application.
