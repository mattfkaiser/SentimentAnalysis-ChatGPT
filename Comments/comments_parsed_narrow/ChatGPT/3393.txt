I use ChatGPT in this way too. Mostly because when I need something explained differently, I'm not holding up the class.

I am awful at math. I once asked ChatGPT to walk me through a basic calculus problem. Despite never taking a calculus class in my life, I understood it.

>I think the conversational aspect helps a lot and respects the way we learn as humans.

If you ask, ChatGPT will outright tell you it's programmed to be friendly and supportive. Who would've thought people learn better when they're given clarity and patience?
