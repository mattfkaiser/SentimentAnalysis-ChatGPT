Glad you like it! I created text-free versions for you and uploaded as [zip here](https://aiandart.club/misc/chatgpt-new-art.zip). Note I also have a [shop](http://aiandart.club/prints) for prints, posters, phone covers and so on. Everything helps to support my work & experiments, as I do this daily for around 8+ hours.
