ChatGPT training data is a couple years out of date.  Also, there can be accuracy problems when it recalls specific documents.  Finally, the training data is only a slice of data from the net while the big search engines attempt to be comprehensive.

So there are those drawbacks.

As long as what you are looking for was broadly represented on the net a couple years ago, then ChatGPT should be pretty good.
