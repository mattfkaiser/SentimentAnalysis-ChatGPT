I used to work at a company called CaptionCall in the US for two years. It provided a transcription service for special phones used by people with hearing impairments.

My job involved going into a nice office, sitting in a cubicle, and transcribing live phone conversations. When a hearing person spoke, I transcribed the words verbally, the computer turned it into text, and the hearing-impaired person read the text on their phone. We had to talk quickly enough to avoid any delay.

I worked this job until just last year, but I knew that my job would be outsourced either to India or to automated text recognition (ChatGPT wasn't a thing yet). 

So I decided to leave and find a new job before the ax came down. I advised my co-workers to do the same, but they ignored me. And sure enough, the company shut down its offices in my city and moved the jobs overseas a few months ago. I'm sure they'll eventually switch to using artificial intelligence when the technology becomes good and cheap enough.

The co-workers who ignored my advice all got laid off.

I have to admit that I miss the job. Although it paid only slightly above minimum wage, the office was super nice and stress-free. Boring as heck tho.

After two years of listening to people's private conversations (they didn't know human was transcribing, they assumed it was just a computer), I discovered that 95% of my fellow Americans talk about groceries, doctor visits, and yard work when calling someone. The remaining 5% complain about politics. LMAO
