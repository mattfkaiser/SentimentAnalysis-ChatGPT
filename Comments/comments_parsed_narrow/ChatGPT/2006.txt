Why would someone go out of there way to prove something to a random stranger on the internet? How does it affect my life whether or not you believe what I  am saying? People here are either in two camps. A. They noticed changes B. They haven’t noticed changes.

If you are in camp B then why does it even matter what is going on in camp A? Whatever you are using chatGPT for is working well and probably will remain that way until it doesn’t, then you will be in camp A without anyone else wasting time trying to prove something that you won’t believe anyway. 

If I am telling the truth I could post evidence. If I am lying I could post evidence (photoshop?).  I don’t even understand why this has to be topic with opposing sides. If you say it is working the same as in the beginning I would just take it for what it is, your experience/ your use cases. If someone says they’ve noticed changes then I take it as their experience with their particular use cases.

Some people on the internet just want everyone to share their same opinions on everything.
