ChatGPT gave me a false sense that information is accurate.  It was very good at summarizing information.  It wasn't very good at determining it gave conflicting information in a summary.  In one series of questions it managed to tell me a book source indicated two different percentages in a calculation.  I pointed out that it gave me two conflicting answers and ChatGPT said "oops I see that now and I'm constantly learning blah blah blah.  I want to be clear I didn't ask ChatGPT to do a calculation.
