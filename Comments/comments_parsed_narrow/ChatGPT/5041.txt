I don't think it's immediately obvious that we've reached a plateau. In a recent talk, Demis Hassabis suggested that AGI could potentially be achieved within the next decade using transformer-based models, and I find myself inclined to believe that. It's perfectly possible.

One aspect people overlook is that in order to make accurate predictions, one must possess a similar level of intelligence in the respective field. For instance, if I were able to predict the moves made by Stockfish in chess, I would need to possess, at the very least, a comparable or superior skill level in chess. Similarly, if I were to accurately anticipate the thoughts and insights of Einstein or Turing in the realms of physics or computer science, I would naturally require an equivalent proficiency in those subjects.

That's why the capacity for prediction is an almost endless measure of intellectual capability.
