This is a UC San Diego study that finds that ChatGPT Outperforms Physicians in High-Quality, Empathetic Answers to Patient Questions https://today.ucsd.edu/story/study-finds-chatgpt-outperforms-physicians-in-high-quality-empathetic-answers-to-patient-questions

Btw the answers are from health providers themselves.

I think chatGPT is definitely going to replace meh-to-ok performers across disciplines. In the case of OP here it sounds like the psychologist is mediocre (not helpful, not insightful, defensive, not adapting to feedback, etc.). 

As a senior engineer who works with AI, I think the only way to survive employment is to use it to augment our skills: being good at your job and using AI intentionally to get even better. If nothing, that desire to grow in itself makes people want to work with you. 
 
But ime people who suck at their jobs don’t usually care about being “augmented”.. they do the minimum, they are defensive/unresponsive when given feedback (even if they hear the same thing from different people), or don’t even view feedback as a gift to grow. There’s no way those of us who fit this description will survive chatGPT, which may be a fair thing.
