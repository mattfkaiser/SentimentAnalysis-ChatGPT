Actually, I've tried this, and it didn't work out so well. I've learned some Kotlin programming (a very meager amount) in order to try and make an Android game. I used ChatGPT at first just asking endless detailed questions, but it actually gave me bad code and downright incorrect direction when I was setting up Android Studio. I ended up having to use Google pathways to learn enough to get started, and quite frankly, I'm seeing the task of learning enough to make anything of value as incredibly daunting. Truthfully, I don't think it's as difficult to learn to code as I used to, but the amount of time you have to dedicate to learn is tremendous.
