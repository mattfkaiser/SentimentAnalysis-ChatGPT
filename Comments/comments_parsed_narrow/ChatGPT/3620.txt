Well for current commercialized AI: apply the most recent of scientific findings. More so, coming from my experience as a senior+ software engineer trying to use ChatGPT, it tends to tell you what you want to hear rather than an objective solution.

Now there is an argument that a good chatgpt user knows how to use prompts where what you want to hear aligns with what you want an objective answer to. But there are a lot of people who go to therapy to affirm their beliefs rather than actually overcome issues (eg cognitive behavioral therapy- the most scientifically proven form of therapy) who won’t respond well to that.

In other words - ChatGPT requires user’s self regulation in order to be effective while many (most?) people in therapy need help resolving issues with their own self regulation.
