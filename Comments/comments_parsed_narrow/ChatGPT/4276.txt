[Vicuna-13b](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) is getting a lot of attention right now.  Click the demo link on that page to try it out.

It's developed by LMSYS (Facebook's research division) and the demo version is shackled to some extent but not as chronically as ChatGPT.  As such, it's already a good alternative when discussing things ChatGPT might find objectionable.

There are so many tweaked versions of Vicuna appearing on Hugging Face that completely unshackled versions sometimes become available on the Kobold Horde... although I think the learning curve is a bit too much for a lot of home users right now.  It works best in 'Instruct Mode' on KoboldAI Lite (if you're lucky enough to be around when someone is sharing their installation).
