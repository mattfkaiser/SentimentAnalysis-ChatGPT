Look AI will develop so much that a conversation with a robot thru the phone per say will be so heart felt people will choose that over an in person visit. Robots will know you better then you know yourself.  I think we might be under estimating the value AI brings to the table.  Just look at how Chat gpt scores on medical exams or law school exams. It's in the top 5% last time I checked. In its infancy darling, in its infancy! Now when it's developed alongside a virtual reality you cannot distinguish from true reality, you won't want to exit? Think about that.
