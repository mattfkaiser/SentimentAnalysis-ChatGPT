You can definitely make that happen without the API right now.

It will take a ton of time, a lot of hands on work, but I could see this.

1. Use ChatGPT to write a script
2. It creates an outline of the scenes in text, a text-based storyboard.
3. Take that text explaining the scene and feed it back to ChatGPT and tell it to give you an SD prompt. 
4. Copy paste that into any Stable Diffusion program (locally or online)
5. Use the "animate" extension in Auto1111 or Vlad's version and animated the prompt.

Will it be good? Maybe?

Might be okay with some compositing, special effects, music, sound, editing and voice over afterwards.

Could be a fun challenge making your own Hollywood trailer with just AI.
