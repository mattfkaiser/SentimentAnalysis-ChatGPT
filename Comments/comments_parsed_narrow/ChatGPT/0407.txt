So for my previous class, I would start by asking him: "are you familiar with the textbook "..." by ..."

Then if he knows that textbook, for quizzes, I will always start a question with "according to [name of the textbook] by [author], [insert your question here]"

This way I am sure that he's getting relevant information. 

I got 98% on my online quizzes by combining my reading and verifying my answers with ChatGPT
