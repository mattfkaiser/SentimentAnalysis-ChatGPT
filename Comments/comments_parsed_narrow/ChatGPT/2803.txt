In a shocking twist of irony and selective memory loss, a local man, Darren Mitchell, of small-town Millbrook, Alabama, caused a stir in his household when he forgot the anniversary of the day he and his wife mutually agreed to stop celebrating anniversaries.

Five years ago, after forgetting their wedding anniversary for the fourth consecutive time, Darren and his wife, Susanna, collectively decided to call off the stress-inducing ritual of marking every year of their marriage. It was a decision Darren was convinced would save him from future humiliation. However, his jubilation was short-lived as he discovered this week that he had, ironically, forgotten the anniversary of this crucial pact. 

On June 1st, 2018, in an unprecedented show of forgetfulness, Darren was caught unawares when Susanna handed him a beautifully wrapped box. She looked at him expectantly, awaiting his reciprocal gift. Inside the box was a humorous mug emblazoned with the phrase "I remembered we don't celebrate anniversaries."

"I thought it was a joke," Darren recounted, his face the picture of mortification. "Then I saw the look on her face, and I realized I had once again forgotten something important. I mean, how many anniversaries can a guy be expected to remember?"

He further added, "Now, I'm not only supposed to remember the wedding anniversary but also the anniversary of when we decided not to remember the wedding anniversary. This is getting too meta for me."

Susanna, in her defense, claimed she only remembered the day because of Facebook's 'Memories' feature. "I swear, Darren would forget his head if it wasn't attached," she added, playfully.

Local psychologists are calling this a breakthrough case in memory studies, dubbing it "The Double Negative Memory Phenomenon."

Dr. Frieda Hughes, a psychologist specializing in memory, remarked, "What we have here is a clear case of memory failure wrapped in the complex layers of irony. This could open up new avenues in the study of human memory and cognitive dissonance. We thank Darren for his contribution to science."

Meanwhile, Darren is exploring ways to remember this new anniversary. His solutions range from setting up a calendar reminder to tattooing the date on his arm. The local tattoo parlor reports a surge in similar requests from husbands around town, signaling a worrying trend of forgetfulness, or perhaps a newfound appreciation for irony.

As the local community debates the implications of Darren's forgetfulness, one thing remains clear: regardless of the number of anniversaries or lack thereof, remembering to forget may be harder than it seems.
