As a simple test, I asked GPT to write a report for me. I used to work in law enforcement, and writing reports on incidents was a daily thing. I used to do it at home and email them in. It takes a long time, because you have to write in a very specific way.

I explained how I would like it to be written, the layout and such.Then I gave it all the facts of the case, and voila. First attempt it was as good as I could have done it myself. If I had that tool available when I still did that job, it would easily save me from 5-10 hours of boring work per week, and I still would get paid for said hours. I assume employers very soon will start to take ChatGPT into account when paying staff to do things the company knows you will use AI to save time..  


I believe the reason so few people say it helps them at work is that they just dont think about what they actually could use it for. They assume it can not be done, and thats it... Remember, people are usually pretty sure that their specific job is somehow advanced, most people dont like to admit that anyone could take their job easily, so they convince themself that they have some special talent/knowledge they dont. Good example of this is driving... 80% of drivers say they are better than the average driver.. That is why people are so sceptical to the idea of self driving cars, they refuse to accept that a computer can do what they percieve as difficult, forgetting that the computer has 50 eyes in all spectrums and so on.
