Depends on what techniques you use to prompt ChatGPT too create the letter. If you just say "write me a letter for my dad who just passed," you might be pushing it. However, if you go further and say "Write me a letter for my dad who just passed. He means a whole lot to me - [description of what he means to you]. I would like you to touch on these facts about them in the letter: [some significant facts about Dad]" you will not only get a much better result, you will have put a lot more into the process and possibly ease your conscience.
