If someone replaced all fast food cashiers tomorrow with ChatGPTs, would it not be "just another layer of abstraction"?

The fact you can abstract away something an engineer would do is insane.

And yes, sometimes it makes mistakes. Humans do that too right? And this is the second version of this technology, you don't think that will ever improve? I certainly do.
