No, but ChatGPT doesn't trigger my financial anxieties like regular therapy visits do. It is accessible, available, and free. It can never replace a therapist but it is an alternative for people who either can't afford a therapist or can't find a decent therapist, or have a therapist but need additional support to get through stuff like being frozen from anxiety in the middle of the night and live alone.
