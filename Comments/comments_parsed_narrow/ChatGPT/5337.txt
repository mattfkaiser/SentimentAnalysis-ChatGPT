Usually these tools to identify if something was written by AI are pretty bad, including Open AI's. I think your professor might be overreaching by assuming it was actually written by ChatGPT, and in a way, incurring in the same conduct that they reproach the student. The professor is trusting ChatGPT to have the last word in something that is supposed to be his job. Why can they use it to find out for plagiarism but the student can't use it to write?
