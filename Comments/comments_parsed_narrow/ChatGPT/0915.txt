I mean, yea an engineer with 10 years of experience is going to know much more than a college student paired with ChatGPT. But once you get into it, an engineer with 5 years of experience could easily be better than another with 15 years of experience. No disrespect to being a college student, you just learn so much in those first few years. 

All that to say, not every engineer is a good one, even with GPT.
