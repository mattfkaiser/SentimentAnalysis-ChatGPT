i think its about honouring the dead. passing off the task of writing it to a bot makes it feel like the task of writing the eulogy means no more to him than a school essay did. ofc we know it means something, but thats just the vibe it gives.

chatGPT’s words might be better, but OP’s words would be more meaningful.

perhaps OP could take chatGPT’s answer and use it as a guide when they’re writing the eulogy, cover all of the same points but say it in your own words, i guess.
