I was trouble shooting dns stuff yesterday. The pattern seems to be this: a human comments somewhere something short and horribly incomplete. ChatGPT tells me in exhaustive detail what that human was hinting at. Finally figured out my dns config had a CNAME loop. I agree that this info was already available, but I will never be able to find it as I will never read the manual on dns configuration, life is too short. I have one or two windows of chatGPT open all day every day now while i program. Oh also its a godsend for gardening advice too...
