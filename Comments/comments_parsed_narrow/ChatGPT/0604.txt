It's more because Christians don't mind their religion being made fun of, Jews and Muslims are more conservative about their beliefs (which makes sense if you respect the Creator). It doesn't have to be violence if that's all you think we can do. We did go through many boycotts and protests, not 'blowing people up'.

You need to ask ChatGPT about how each society has different types of people and that not all humans share the same traits. Also, ask if it's ok to be racist toward a set of people just because your beliefs don't aline. 

Violence is shit and surprise surprise, almost 2 BILLION human beings identify as Muslim. If we are violent, like you said, why would we not bring hell on earth already? Because only 0.2% of us cause harm, and the rest are ORDINARY HUMAN BEINGS!!!
