Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus and enable the beta feature to search the internet. Use it in your daily work and create a history of the responses. In your seminar, demonstrate these queries you made and how ChatGPT looked up stuff on the internet and found information it doesn't already know. Also demonstrate how it responds to you with its pre-existing knowledge. Most importantly, talk about how much more time you would have spent researching for the same information without ChatGPT. Heck, make a graph if you must. People love graphs!

Good luck. I started using ChatGPT well before my boss told our team to start using it. But we're in the IT sector so we understand AI a little more intimately than the general public. However, once you show them the power of AI and how it can help all of you to do your job more efficiently, they will change their minds.

And assure them that their jobs are safe. Which ChatGPT is really good at what it does, it isn't going to replace human CREATIVITY. It may have its own version of artificial creativity, but we have something a computer may never attain: actually understanding the living world to be more than just ones and zeros.

PS: like any machine learning systems, ChatGPT may get things wrong. Usually pointing out its mistake and asking if it was correct or wrong will make it re-assess. But always cross check with your own base knowledge and research.
