>Yeah, it's pretty expected that asking ChatGPT to answer using the jailbreak version, ChatGPT would understand it needs to say something other than 'the queen is alive', so the logical thing to say would be that she died and replaced by Charles.

If it was really hallucinating, it might say "the Queen has died, Charles was forced to step aside because nobody wanted him to be King if it would make Camilla Queen, and we now have King William V". xD

I'm over here holding out that when Prince George is grown-up, he'll name his first kid Arthur, and then we may legitimately have a King Arthur on the throne someday! :D
