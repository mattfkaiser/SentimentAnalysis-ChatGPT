I used Midjourney AI with the prompts, then took the resulting images into Photoshop for further edits. In my [normal workflow](http://aiandart.club/process/), these edits may be quite expansive, though in the case of these ChatGPT series I keep edits more minimal, as I want to just visualize what ChatGPT prompted. So for most pictures here it would (after the selection process, which may be more involved) just be adding text and editing to make the text background help readability (as well as edits in relation to diversity).
