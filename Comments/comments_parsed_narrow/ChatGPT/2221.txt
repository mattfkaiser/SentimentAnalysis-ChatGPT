You ain't going to change people as much as you think, not in the short term, anyway.

Youtube, Books, Podcasts have allowed people to accelerate learning tremendously, and now with ChatGPT a whole lot of the mundane tasks can be automated.

I've been using openai's stuff since early January. I saw how powerful it was, and I've been trying to get everyone to use it. It's simply a no-brainer.

But

People are dumb.

People don't want to think.

People don't want to go through all that hard work of learning it, even if it would save them multiples of the time invested.

Just do you.

they'll come around, or be forced out of the labor market and bemoan how ai took their jobs, while you, you'll stick around because you basically just multiplied your output.
