The subtle point might be if school/uni kids are relying on chatGPT for their research and essay writing, they aren’t actually learning the core skills that those activities teach. There is method in the madness of refining the fifth draft of an essay.  

So out in the real world, when presented with novel situations where ChatGPT doesn’t work, they’re on the back foot.

As a senior lawyer I worry how the next generation will hone their craft if AI becomes too much of a crutch.  It’s good for me, as I can use it for the dross work so it saves me time & money. But doing that dross work is how junior lawyers cut their teeth, and if they haven’t done the donkey work how will they ever know if what ChatGPT is producing is actually correct? 🤷🏽‍♀️
