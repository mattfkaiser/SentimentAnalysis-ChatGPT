I tried it for some mental health stuff. I found it to be helpful for sure - especially in regards to giving me actionable homework-type assignments that I could use to address specific things I am dealing with.   


That being said, I think there is an accountability aspect of a Psychologist. Having a relationship with one and building it over time allows them (and you) to better understand what you are going through in a way that something like ChatGPT couldn't. They can also pull in past conversations you've had to determine if prior context could be influencing future outcomes.   


Trust me, I had the same exact thought as you. I really don't want to go to therapy and dealing with an AI seemed much more appealing. But after a few weeks of trying it out, I am pretty convinced that an actual Therapist does offer significant value over an AI. I think part of the benefit of therapy *is* the human element.   


Unloading onto a human and just feeling like another human listened to you, heard you, considered you, etc. is really helpful and freeing. It can offer a lot of validity to your feelings whereas an AI can only give you the reassurance of helping you better understand yourself. Sometimes though, you need another person there to help you with the work.
