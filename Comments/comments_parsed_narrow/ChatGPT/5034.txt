I disagree. Sam Altman said himself in Lex Fredmans podcast that the main difference between GPT 3.5 and the ones before it that made it go from very clunky to almost human was the human-in-the loop training. He then went on to say that the changes between 3.5 and 4 were about 100 or so minor changes. Now I hear that they are halting development on 5 because of AI safety. Maybe? Or maybe it’s because they have run out of tricks. I’m not saying the technology isn’t amazing, just that it is possible they pretty much nailed it with chatGPT, made it a bit better with 4 but now they are stuck again. There will probably still be improvement as the community finds more ways to use the API and develop specific plugins but I don’t think we are close to AGI
