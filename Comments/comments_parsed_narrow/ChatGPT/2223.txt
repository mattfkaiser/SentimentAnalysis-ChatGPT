To be honest i've talked to ChatGPT a few times in the past few weeks trying to compare cameras and he kept giving me false information like "this camera does 4K60fps" when it only did 4K30, "this camera has IBIS" when it didn't etc

after awhile i got tired of it and said "why are you so unreliable man" and it just disconnected and didn't wanna talk anymore, so i'm not sure it's the best to use in such an important field until he gets very reliable unless you fact check everything he tells you, also, chatgpt logs in everything you say so it might to be the best on secret things like these
