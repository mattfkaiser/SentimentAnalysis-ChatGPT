I lost my grandma a couple months ago. I haven't lost someone really close to me and so this was a new situation for me. Before she passed, I knew I most likely had one more conversation with her (she was mostly unresponsive but could hear what we were saying). I used ChatGPT to help me sort out what to say, how to say goodbye and how to make the most of the moment. I'm really glad I did.
