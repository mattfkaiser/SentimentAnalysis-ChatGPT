I am so sorry for your loss. I can’t imagine how you feel. 

On a much smaller scale, though, I recently received news that person who I was close with a while ago, but had lost contact with, had passed away. I felt guilty for losing contact and sad that they were gone. 

I wrote them a letter and it really gave me closure. I felt a lot better after writing it. 

I agree with the people who say you don’t want to become attached and continue to use ChatGPT for this, because that defeats the point of having closure…. But to help you say goodbye, I think this is a lot like what I did. You just got to have a “response” that sounded like something your loved one would say.
