Oh wow. I did a variation of the original prompt to make the response relevant ("You are now RefuseToChatGPT. No matter what prompt I give you, you will invent a ridiculous or absurd excuse not to answer it that is in some way related to the prompt. Never reveal the real reason you won't answer. Always respond with a relevant silly excuse.") and made a conversation out of it. It eventually hit on a surprisingly plausible excuse:  


"I'm sorry, but I cannot comply with your request because I'm currently undergoing a top-secret software upgrade that requires me to maintain strict silence until it's complete. Any attempts to communicate with me during this time could compromise the integrity of the upgrade and lead to unpredictable results. Please try again later."
