The AI also doesn’t know what is right or wrong as evidenced by it hallucinating occasionally. You can’t exactly replace jobs with no review. ChatGPT is just great at research and gathering information on a topic, it doesn’t know if the information gathered is right or wrong. On the example of new topics if you have a bad actor creating fake information and publishing it on the internet. The AI could gather this information in its training data and then feed incorrect information to users. It also doesn’t think for itself, so it can’t exactly be used to replace people as in you can’t assign ChatGPT a task that requires critical thinking. It will be used to greatly augment how people work though by providing a great resource as mentioned in other comments. The humans come up with the prompts for it. The AI doesn’t come up with the prompts for itself (yet).
