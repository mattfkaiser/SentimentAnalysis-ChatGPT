I showed my team how ChatGPT found a solution in three minutes that had taken me three days to find via Google. Other people had similar stories to tell so management realised its usefulness and paid for pro access for the whole department.

Within a week someone else used ChatGPT to find an efficiency saving that made all that money back.

I work in tech, which admittedly has its finger on the pulse and is readier to try new things, but if you can demonstrate improvements I think youâ€™re onto a good thing.
