I don’t see anything added here manually, or chatgpt getting you trying to remember something. If you know your half-remembered plot, simple google search is most of the times good enough for finding it. If you have to change keywords to find the appropriate answer, chances are you have to do the same in chatgpt as well. 

I am not saying chatgpt is pointless, i am saying finding simple google results is not something chatgpt excels at. It’s strength lies in, summarizing articles, finding sentiments, expressing chain of thoughts, that Google simply can’t (yet).
