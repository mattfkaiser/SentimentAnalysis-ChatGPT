So, I have been thinking about this constantly since the technology was released to the general public. I heard an earlier commenter on the technology say, “we are moving from an an answer to a question society”. I still have that as a core theory. The next step is really tricky and will determine if this is the equivalent of the internet. 
In the openai paper it was revealed that they had gpt4 ready a long time before they even released 3. I’d like to think it was for safety, it certainly was a part of it because Sam Altman seems like a thoughtful man. He said recently that they aren’t even working on 5 and this is the tipping point. 
As you all probably know if you are on this string, a lot of big tech guys want us to go back to an AI winter in fear of AGI as their stated fear. I say stated because I question if there is something else behind it. What is to stop someone on this string from having enough skill with the new tech to build a better Facebook or google or Twitter? Why would you want to remove a huge barrier to entry by allowing the people with the right questions and the right drive beat you? 
The thing is, they can likely do it. The only question is are they too late. Like an instagram picture, once it’s out there, it’s there forever. Smart people have been cloning it since the day it came out and if they pulled it tomorrow a lot of people would probably work harder to deliver something. 
Development has probably moved to the equivalent of the garages where the pcs were being worked on. The big guys aren’t going to give you the keys to the car. Bard is a token offering (pun originally not intended but now I am proud of) because Google wanted to prove themselves. It’s basically a different way to use Google. I’m not sure there is any reason for them to do any better. I’m not even sure we want them to do better and shock the markets with a massive loss of revenue. 
I’m amazed that bing is supposed to be on gpt4 but is really disappointing. Anyone who thinks that is really 4 is not actually using 4. It is really good. Sometimes I dial back to 3.5 to save my 25 messages per 3 hours or just to support the community need for bandwidth when I am asking questions that are easy enough for 3.5. When I dial back, I am amazed that 2 months ago that output looked revolutionary and now looks sloppy compared to 4. 
Long story short, I think it will have an even bigger effect on the world then the internet if we let it play out or if it’s already enough and the genie is out of the bottle. Twelve year olds that grew up on the internet are inventing these types of advancements, twelve year olds growing up on gpt4 have limitless potential to create. I hope the big guys give it a chance to play out. I could certainly be wrong about the catastrophic dangers but we live with a lot of catastrophic danger every day. I’d love to see us give this a shot and change the world. If you are still with me, thanks. This is the longest thing I’ve written without a computer since Chatgpt came out.
