The best way I've been able to demonstrate to people the flaws of using ChatGPT this way, and the reasons they need to be careful is to ask someone to give me a completely ridiculous book title, and then show them as I ask ChatGPT to "write a summary of {insane, made up book title} by author {insert their name here}.  ChatGPT will then spit out a completely believable book summary with confidence, about a book that clearly doesn't exist, written by them.  People seem to then understand some of the limitations.  There are many ways to show this obviously, but people really need to be careful with this tool, and understand what they are getting as output.  

I also wonder if your professor is just trying to scare people away from using ChatGPT to write their essays.  I would really hope there would be some kind of hearing before a student was suspended, where it could be shown that this method of determining cheating is not accurate.
