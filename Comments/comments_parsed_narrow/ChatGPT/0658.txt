Thanks for taking a look! Yeah, Chrome extension would be cool. We wanted an app because we used to find recipes while cruising through random sites on our phone. I’d think “that sounds good, I’d make that” But then never remember where the recipe went once it came time to cook. ChatGPT and the GPT API make it much easier to pull out the relevant content to save it for later. It’s an admittedly basic use case for a super advanced technology, but it serves its purpose.
