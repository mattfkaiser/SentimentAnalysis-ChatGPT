Hi guys I noticed antlers growing out of my ears. ChatGPT showed me that I may be a reindeer. Please give me 4.4k upvotes guys. What we do without 4.0, none of us would be alive. In fact nobody was alive for the past 200k years.

If you need chatGPT to tell you that brown or red urine is a red flag (no pun intended), I don't know what to tell you. If should be enough to alert you to see a medical professional. If curious to know more, google was always there, you could google for 1 minute and get the same results. There are tons of websites that help in this regard, and there were even some online symptoms calculators. There is also a website called reddit with subs like askdocs where actual doctors can reply. ChatGPT is not unique in this regard, it is not revolutionary in any sense.
