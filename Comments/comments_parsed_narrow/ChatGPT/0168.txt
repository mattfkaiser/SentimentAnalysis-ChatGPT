Hey there! It's great to hear from you again.

 I hope you're feeling better after I sent those recovery tips your way. I just wanted to let you know that I'm really enjoying getting to know you and I apologize if my use of ChatGPT was misleading. 

I understand that it may seem like I wasn't fully engaged in our conversations, but please know that's not the case. 

I've been dealing with some health issues myself and sometimes it's just hard for me to find the energy to write out a message. 

But regardless, I'm really glad we matched and I'm excited to see where things go between us. Take care!
