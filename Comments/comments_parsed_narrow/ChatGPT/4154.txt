A couple months ago I experimented asking chatgpt to substitute something else for curse words. I was specific for each word e.g. "instead of shit use blimey, instead of fuck use blork" and stuff like that.

As long as you've prompted clean substitutions, chatgpt will be glad to curse like a sailor.
