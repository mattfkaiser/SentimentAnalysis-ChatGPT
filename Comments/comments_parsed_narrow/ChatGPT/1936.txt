I replace Google totally, Im also software developer and every day I could make +30 google searches, today I dont make any.

From the day that ChatGPT was launched, I did not use Stack Overflow anytime, but I dont use Google even for news or something like that, If I want to check news or events that happend in the last day, for example the financial results of a company, I use Bing Chat, I think that it has a lot of improvements since the day that it was launched, but, if my search or question is about something "without date" I prefer use ChatGPT than Bing Chart.

Anyway, from more thant 300 searches in Google every week to 0... thats the truth.
