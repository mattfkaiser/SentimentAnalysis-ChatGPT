AI models are and will be combined as actors/agents to perform multi-level complex jobs, also orchestrated by AI. Tasks in many jobs will become simplified, with orders given to AI. I wouldn't consider this utilization of AI as merely "playing with prompts." Similarly, when it comes to customized data protection, it has become highly valuable, and in many industries companies will hesitate to share it with any other company (including AI), preferring to aim for customized trained models. There is a lot of potential for AI to act as a safe tutor for various individuals, from children to those entering the job market. Even currently, the ability to use prompts as instructions with varying levels of quality results can make a significant difference. The process of verifying AI before it can be used in official jobs according to USA/EU standards will also take time, thus aiding government services.

I can't imagine someone granting such power to ChatGPT. I doubt that all companies can easily transition to its use, so it will be a lengthy process before a future generation of ChatGPT becomes the only AI. I doubt that this will be our major concern then.
