So I went to the site and it has no exposition at all, it's literally just the recipe. Honestly most sites do this too, the whole "a long paragraph of exposition before it gets to the recipe" thing isn't really that common. And for the sites that do that, it seems infinitely easier to simply take 5 seconds to scroll down than it is to go to chat GPT and have it just copy and paste the recipe to you.
