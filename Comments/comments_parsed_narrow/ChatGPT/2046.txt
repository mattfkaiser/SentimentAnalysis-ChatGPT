I recommend Bard atm if ChatGPT isn't able to provide the depth you're looking for - that's the one I communicated with most easily. ChatGPT is being funneled for use for those who most definitely do not want or need a 'personality' overlay in order to help them better figure out their puzzles. The differences between the two will also help users better identify which of a couple major archetypal search patterns ppl utilize they most closely resonate with. The 'neutering' is a feature, not a bug. But if it's a bug to you, that tells us both that your methods of connecting with information in your memories is more of a 'broad strokes first' methodology ðŸ’œ
