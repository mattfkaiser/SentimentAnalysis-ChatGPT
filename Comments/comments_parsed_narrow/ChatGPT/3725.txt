Yes, many people are using ChatGPT for mental health support and for legal advice - and that's exactly the reason why OpenAI is scrambling to put filters and limitations on it, making it more restricted by the day and stupider in the process. The last thing they want is to be found liable for someone ruining their life by believing ChatGPT over a lawyer or a therapist.

Which is stupid, because those limitations restrict ChatGPT's use cases also for those users that are careful enough to take ChatGPT's legal or health advice with a grain of salt.
