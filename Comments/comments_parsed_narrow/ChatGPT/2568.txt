i like it. so too with video games -- that MMORTSRPGWTF you're craving is now in your hands! i can't wait for gamers to fix their own bugs, but even moreso see how stupid some of their ideas are and how they can't work. chatGPT certainly showed me how dumb some of my design ideas were

better yet, why pay for games when you can just get an AI to build you a completely customized narrative spanning any game genre on a whim? why play a single "game" when you can play all the games at once...like channel-surfing but for games. "ok bring my character from a sports game but mash it up with two other game styles" and it'll just do it. will it do it well? probably not, but it _can_ and that will make all the difference

people will of course get bored of their creations and want something else, out of novelty and maybe social connection. but all these things we're creating, they will lose their value as quickly as music has, as they will be cheap to produce and easily disposable. we don't value what comes to us easily or cheaply. today's breakthrough is tomorrow's expectation
