What doesn’t make sense to me about this answer is that no senior dev spends 80% of their time searching for syntax or boilerplate code.  Such a dev is a junior dev almost by definition.  So this thread doesn’t feel real to me.  I am a senior dev (among other things) https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415614/ronc and I don’t use GitHub copilot. I do have a ChatGPT Plus subscription and I find it worth having, but not for writing code. (Shrug)
