>Education needs to change

100% right,  this is at the core of this thread and the 1000's like it. 

Education has been removing or restricting tools from students and asking them to demonstrate knowledge without them for a long a time.  Like Exams where notes and calculators were not allowed or the chat GPT stuff coming up now.  Education needs to accept the changed world and focus on increasing skills that are now relevant.

The workplace and real world is not about achivieing anything the hard way if there is a better way to do something or a tool that works then it can and should be used.
