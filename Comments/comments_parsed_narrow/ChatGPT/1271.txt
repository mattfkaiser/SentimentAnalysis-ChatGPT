ChatGPT4 is better than 3.5, by a large margin, so it does matter which one you use. That said, when I use it for important things, I still don't expect it to be right every time; ChatGPT works best when you're asking for help in a field with which you are at least somewhat familiar, so that you can catch the errors. But when I can do things like ask for a SQL query and it spits out working code that doesn't need tweaking, that's really powerful.
