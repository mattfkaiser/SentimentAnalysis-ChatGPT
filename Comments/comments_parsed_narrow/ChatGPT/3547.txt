ChatGPT saves me 2-6 hours a week. Straight up. I write a TON of reports and have to compose Executive Summaries for different clients that need to not sound "canned". 

So I have a chat that is set up with the parameters I need, I feed it a bullet point list of what I want to say, and it does the rest. A little editing, and a 2 hour job becomes 15 minutes. 

My friend needed to write a 500-word grant application and had spent 2 weeks trying to get it right. I entered a single-sentence prompt and the output was 10x better than what he created after 2 weeks of sweat. And it got him the grant.

This, right here, is an incredible game-changer. To me, this is mind-blowing magic all on its own. I don't know why people need to use hyperbole.
