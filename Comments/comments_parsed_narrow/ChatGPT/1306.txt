I mean, the GPT API is just a more pure version, since ChatGPT itself runs on the API. They do alter GPT itself about once a month, but the consistent degradation of ChatGPT’s capabilities that people have been noticing is just them changing the initial context.

ChatGPT is just GPT-4 with extra context at the start, just like all of these GPT-based clones (Snapchat My AI, KhanAcademy’s bot, etc.)
