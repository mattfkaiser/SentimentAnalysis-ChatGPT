Glad you like them! I did add words for styling and picked the ones I like best, so there was a human element in this, and then I did further processing in Photoshop. For those images where ChatGPT's prompt totally failed -- that was mostly just the macro castle image -- I helped out with two to three additional keywords so that ChatGPT's idea is expressed (still not my idea though, I just facilitated what ChatGPT described).

And true, ChatGPT does not need to know about Midjourney to produce usually-well-working prompts. You can utilize ChatGPT-4's "browsing" plugin though to point ChatGPT to the latest Midjourney docs, I tried that in the past. But it's usually not really needed as Midjourney often works great with natural language (a lot of the prompt keywords like "hyperrealistic zeiss lens xyz beautiful picture of xyz" type prompts don't do much helpful any way, at least not anymore).
