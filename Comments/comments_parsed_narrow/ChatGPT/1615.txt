I would say this is natural human behavior. Humans are constantly trying to break other humans.

Embed yourself in a 4th grade class at any public school. You will see the kids constantly “f*#k” with each other. I think that’s part of learning how to suss out bullshit.

So ChatGPT I think is getting the natural learning method. For example, if any kid in grade school answered in some of the obtuse ways ChatGPT does, they would be treated with the same indignity as most user treat ChatGPT. That is to say, they would be made fun of unmercifully until they learned people were messing with them and responded accordingly.
