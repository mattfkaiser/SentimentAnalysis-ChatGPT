I’m an IT Tech/System Admin. Bard is the closest and it’s ass. I pay for ChatGPT Plus and just use the beta plugins. You’re really not going to find a ChatGPT alternative that is “better”. Almost all alternatives are based off of GPT-3. Google Bard is the closest, because OpenAI used Google’s AI model (transformer). OpenAI did much better on the nuances end of language, which is why ChatGPT still shits on Bard. OpenAI also used Reddit as one of its teaching aids. Just use it. Y’all are making things harder than they have to be and are still getting ass responses.

If it’s banned in your country…use a VPN.
