I don’t think it’s unethical. I used chat GPT to help me with a toast for my sister’s wedding. However, I did not just say “Write me a toast for my sister's wedding“. I started by prompting it to ask me questions about my sister and her husband that would eventually help it give me ideas about what kind of things to include. It was a kind of a long process with lots of do-overs because I was trying to get the prompts just so and I also had it make changes to certain parts I didn’t like or make a certain part more humorous or emotional. Then I practiced it and used a teleprompter app to deliver it. I guess my point is, technology is going to be part of our lives, and maybe eventually even in death. So I would not be ashamed to use this as a tool to help you put into words what you feel. Of course, there is always the easy route and make it just write a generic speech but that is just not using it to its full potential IMO. Btw, I’m sorry for your loss.
