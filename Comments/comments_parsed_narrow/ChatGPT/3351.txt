That’s what I’ve always thought about. I’ve been out of college for a few years now, but I was definitely using Wolfram Alpha back then. Maybe ChatGPT is more accessible and it can be used on more than math and science, but stuff like this has been around for a while. I had to actually learn what I was doing because I couldn’t use it in tests, which I imagine is no different now. 

The main thing I feel like I missed out on is using ChatGPT for “discussion” questions in online classes. That would’ve been the best.
