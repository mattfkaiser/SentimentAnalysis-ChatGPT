I've seen this over the last couple days GitHub Copilot absolutely losing context in the middle of re-indenting code and I don't realize it but all kinds of critical details about all kinds of functions have changed. And then even gpt4 was responding to my questions about code with answers about phonographic records as if it was an unfind tuned model just generating text. I tried to have it search which I almost never bother using the plugins because they almost never work and it lost track of what it was searching for in the middle of the search and came back with totally unrelated results and one of the converse about things that were so off topic.
