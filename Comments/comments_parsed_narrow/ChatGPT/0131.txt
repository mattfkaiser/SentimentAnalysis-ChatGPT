I did use a conversation stater for a girl I match on. In one of the pictures she was wearing a red dress. So I asked ChatGpt to generate response for a pick up link for a girl wearing a beautiful red dress. 

Response was something like this - 

*Excuse me miss, but you're making the traffic stop with that red dress.*
