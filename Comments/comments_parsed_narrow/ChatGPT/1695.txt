This guy is smart. He’s on a world tour talking about how dangerous his company’s creation is/could be; this is essentially a marketing campaign disguised as a PSA. “My product is so powerful, and effective, that it must be regulated.” Facebook achieved the same thing with its documentary “the social dilemma” which was at its core an ad to advertisers about how effective Facebook is as targeting people. 

His proposal for regulation would also cement ChatGPT as the only, or at the very least, primary player, in the AI game by bottlenecking innovation in bureaucracy. 

It looks selfless, but it’s entirely self-serving and greedy. Can’t stand these ghouls.
