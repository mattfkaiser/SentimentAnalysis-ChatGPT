I went down a rabbit hole and tried to learn ZX Assembly Language but got bored pretty quick. As an Android developer, I thought it would be great to create the 16x16 sprites for the machine, then I noticed r/PixelArt has over 1m Redditors so I thought that's a sizeable chunk to create an app for. Then I thought it would be cool to animate things. Initially, simple GIF's of any size were my intention but now you've given me another reason to develop the idea further. 

With the help of ChatGPT, I created the skeleton in 2 weeks. It's still a long way from MVP but you've reassured me that I'm following the right path.
