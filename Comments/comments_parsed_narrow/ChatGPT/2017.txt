I wouldn't be surprised if plugins and web browsing have something to do with perception.  They use more tokens which can make chatgpt seem dumber.

Also, OpenAI has made it clear that this is still not a final product.  They likely do a lot of A/B testing, which may increase or decrease ability.

Or, their servers are melting and they had to reduce capability to keep up with load.  I wouldn't be surprised if GPT is smarter during lower use hours.
