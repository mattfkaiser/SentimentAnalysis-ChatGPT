I disagree with your first statement when just about every teacher I know is concerned their students are exploiting chatGPT. The main thing that’s holding that timebomb down is the fact you can’t get access to chatGPT 4 very easily at the moment and 3.5 is woefully lacking in quality compared to 4 for genuine natural language writing.

The most interesting thing about chatGPT is what’s happening in the coding and scripting space.
