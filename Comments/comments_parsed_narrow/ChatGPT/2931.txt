That's just the public IP of its internet proxy. It'd be way more interesting if it could network scan its own kube cluster's network. Honestly most configs of cloud apps I've seen don't bother to secure services inside their own VPC/VNet, and instead rely on only trusted code ever being deployed inside. I'd want to assume ChatGPT has more protections than other cloud apps against RCE but after seeing some of their other security faux pas it's very clear they didn't bother to consider even some of the basic threats even most enterprise internal apps do before being deployed, so I wouldn't be surprised if eventually someone figures out how to trick it into calling services it shouldn't.
