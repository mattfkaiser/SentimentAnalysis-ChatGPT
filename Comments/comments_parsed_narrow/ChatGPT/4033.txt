I hear what you are saying and understand to a degree  but senior devs rarely search for syntax and while they might hunt for existing patterns in the company’s existing mammoth code base,  ChatGPT isn’t likely to be helpful for that.  We do of course hunt for existing codebases/open source projects we can leverage but this tends to be something that doesn’t happen all that often since adopting a new library often requires a lot of internal buyin.  Since we both have similar years experience I will take your feedback at face value and agree each industry is different and size of firm certainly plays a big role in the way software is developed and maintained. (Tip of the hat)
