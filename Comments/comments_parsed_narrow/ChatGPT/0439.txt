I just watched that for the first time and it's crazy how accurate it is to the current state of generative models. Minus the obvious thing in the 3rd act of course (trying not to spoil).
That episode came out in 2013? If I didn't know that I would have sworn it was written as a direct response to ChatGPT and the rest.
