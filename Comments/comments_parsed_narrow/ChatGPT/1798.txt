It’s a very personal thing. I’ve done two speeches at funerals now, one was for my dad. I didn’t really care too much about the other people and what they thought but I wanted to say what I wanted in my own way. If chatgpt can articulate it better than you can and you’re happy with what you’re saying go for it. You only get to do this once, remember that.
