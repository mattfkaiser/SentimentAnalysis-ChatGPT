can you really write an essay with chatgpt at university level ? i tried a couple of times and it's nowhere near good or reliable enough for the quality of work I'm expected to write.

then again i only used gpt 3.5 not 4, and i was in a high level program in a top university, maybe it can do something passable for simpler subjects or degrees.
