Fair. Also, a good argument for why educators should allow learners to use AI to augment their works because maybe I'm learning from it? 

Formatting and structuring is something I really, really struggle with. Because of that, I've been running the majority of my work communications through ChatGPT for revisional suggestions for about 4 months now. Maybe I'm picking up on it, thus, achieving the end goal of wanting students to improve their writing skills.
