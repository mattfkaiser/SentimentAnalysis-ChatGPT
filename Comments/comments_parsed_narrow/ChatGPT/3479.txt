Seriously. A big obstacle for me when applying for scholarships or writing letters of intent is I *despise* marketing myself. Sprinkle in some ADHD and my brain just doesn’t have to patience to wordsmith tailored letters and essays that require me to sell myself. That said, it’s already helped me with scholarships. In that sense, Chat GPT has been life changing for me. I’m actually a little less intimidated about applying to grad school and future jobs because of how helpful it is in constructing an excellent letter of intent/cover letter/whatever. I can research and write essays on topics that interest me for days. Can’t market myself to save my life though.
