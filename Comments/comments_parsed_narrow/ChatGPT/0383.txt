Totally agree with this. It's pretty good at generating small code snippets, and the fact that you can ask follow up questions is so helpful.

I've been learning Ansible with ChatGPT walking me through setting up playbooks and roles. I can ask questions like "What if the file doesn't exist?" or "Can you change this from copying the file to using a template instead?" and it does a pretty great job.

Sometimes it'll use deprecated commands or make something up entirely, but once I figure that out I sometimes realize I'm approaching a problem in the wrong way.

Seriously impressive how quickly ChatGPT became part of my workflow.
