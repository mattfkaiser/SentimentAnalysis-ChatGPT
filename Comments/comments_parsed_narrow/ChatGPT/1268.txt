I think I can safely say, that in 1985, probably only around 15% of people (or fewer) would have said they find a home PC "very useful," and not many more than that in offices. Many actively disliked PCs and didn't think they would ever use them. I was on my third computer by then and was a complete outlier. 

By '85, I also had a mobile phone, and those were considered an extreme oddity. Both PCs and phones were very expensive. ChatGPT has the benefit of being immediately useful and quite inexpensive. Consumer AI will go from 'not useful' to 'essential' in record time, dwarfing the adoption rates of PCs and phones.
