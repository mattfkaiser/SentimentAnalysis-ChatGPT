EDIT: Thanks very small fraction of Christians for the death threats! You're so peaceful... and to all the agnostics and atheists that keep up-voting extremely hard, thanks for bringing some hope and sanity. You don't have to keep upvoting anymore, knowing y'all exist is enough for me. I thought I was going insane.

Judaism and Christianity literally have Moses tell his men to kill all women, men and boys of a tribe and to take the young virgin girls who have not laid with any man as their wives. (Numbers 31 in English standard Bible.)

Rabbis etc. believe that Isaac was 40 when he married 3-10 year old Rebekah and fucked her (Sound similar?)

EDIT 2: Some "scholars" down below don't believe me, but the 3-10 year old narrative is only a "Jewish" strain. The more popular narrative is that she was 14, according to the Jewish womens archive, because pedophilia bad for thee, but not for me. Reminder, these are the same type of people getting angry at Pride Month. And Moses being a pedophile warlord will be completely ignored as well.

Christian scholars believe in the above and that Joseph married Mary who was 12, at age 90.

EDIT 2: One of the books I remembered is the Biblical apocrypha where Mary was 14. I remember reading it in German and Mary was 14 and Joseph was old. 

Of course it's going to perform mental gymnastics when Jesus gets praised for cucking Joseph and banging a 12 year old to birth himself and forgive mankinds sins.

EDIT 2: Did I really say anything untrue in the statement? Is 14 year old girl gets raped by God and births God somehow more digestible? 

I even asked about Hinduism and ChatGPT denies the caste system exists, denies these verses: Baudhāyana (4. 1.11). — ‘Let him give his daughter, while she still goes about naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep the maiden in his house after she has reached the age of puberty.’Gautama (18-21). — ‘A girl should be given in marriage before puberty.’Vaśiṣṭha (17.70). — ‘Out of fear of the appearance of the menses, let the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked.

and overall just pretends that religions are all squeaky clean. When I asked it about Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, it said that it was okay and normal at the time.

Edit 2: Evidence Sahih al-Bukhari 5133In-book reference : Book 67, Hadith 69 

**Edit 2: Reference** : Sahih Muslim 1422aIn-book reference : Book 16, Hadith 81USC-MSA web (English) reference : Book 8, Hadith 3309 

When I asked it about the other things, it said the same things or said "It didn't know".
