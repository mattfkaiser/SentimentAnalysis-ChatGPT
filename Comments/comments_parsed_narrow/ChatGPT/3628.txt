i studied psychology and, tbh, i think AI could probably replace some kind of therapies. it would be interesting to research if a gpt, not chatgpt per se but a gpt specifically trained in psychology, would perform better or worse compared to a trained clinical psychologyst  


psychologysts are safe from chatgpt now because giving therapy is a lot more than advice  


i think what chatgpt (or any gpt) could be useful rn is to help with crisis or suicide intervention, as those usually happen when you are not with your therapist. but at the same time i think it might be worse because the interaction with a human is a lot more nuanced
