Makes me wonder if the story I made entirely by prompting ChatGPT would be copywriteable, given that I asked it to make many very specific changes to it down to the exact wording of things. In that case, when modifying it, the specific output could in fact be predicted quite well. The only reason I even used AI for those edits instead of revising manually was to see if I could.
