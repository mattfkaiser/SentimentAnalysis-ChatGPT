Exactly. I used chat GPT on my papers to help me structure things better. You bet my ass I read that paper at least 50 times to make sure it sounds good before submitting it. I ended up memorizing a lot that was in it because of that. Not to mention I did have to go out and find my own sources and put them in because Chat GPT sucks with that.
