I have never been able to get any Chat GPT to stay on track with anything slightly complex.  I have had great success asking very specific questions that require succinct answers or short code snippets (50 lines?).  I will be going back and forth and it seems to be understanding what we are doing, then out of nowhere it just responds with the "botsplaining", after that I have to start over.  So, for me, I think it has been dumb from the get go. Amazing and usefull, but not as much as you would hope.
