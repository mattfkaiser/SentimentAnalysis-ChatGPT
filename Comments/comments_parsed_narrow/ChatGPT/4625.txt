Exactly - I can't understand the negativity when trying to explain every day use cases of ChatGPT to the people in this thread.

Down voted for explaining actual usage, and even when someone else gets it - you get down voted as well.

Either people are not using GPT 4, or they don't know how to phrase their GPT conversations or they flat out haven't tried it or don't want to.

Hallucinations is a thing - and I can give dozens of examples where I have caught ChatGPT out in a lie, but you work through those.
