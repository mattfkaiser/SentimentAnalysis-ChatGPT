I also stopped using Google for about 80% of anything codding related question i have, especially for simple stuff, chatGPT gives me a quick an answer like i'm asking someone who is experienced. I also use chatGPT for medical, agricultural, mechanical or any other specialized questions i have, but always take the anwsers with a grain of salt similarly like I would from a human. i cross check the anwser i get by google searching and visiting a reliable official website. 8 out of 10 times chatGPT gives me an accurate anwser. Sometimes chatGPT may answer wrong especially if its something very specialized and theres not much information about it.
 it made life much easier, mostly because it can understand you better than just a google search. You can do spelling mistakes or any other mistakes and it would correct you like a human would which google search can't do that. Then with the information you get, you can do your research online, and treat it like an assistant. Overall i think chatGPT is a great tool.
