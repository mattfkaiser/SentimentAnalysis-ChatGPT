I Wonder if you could Give chatgpt just as much info as you could about your relationship with your father and just data dump your soul onto the page, see what it responds, and chop the bits and ends,

Personally, i have used Chatgpt recently in a scenario where i gave it prompts to write a mothers Day message in a family group chat including many mothers, new mothers, grandmothers, and figurative ones. Chatgpt gave me 3-4 paragraphs back using mostly my own prompts but connecting them seamlessly. From there i chose words more likely to have actually been spoken by me by probability.
And all in all Nobody realized, Everyone loved the message, and those words were how i actually felt.
