In the early days everyone did not want the internet nor could everyone access it.  For the first year 18 months it was very much young, educated early adopters as it is with Chat GPT.  Broadband was not a thing, the internet through 56k modem was far from compelling.  To hear the phrase “it’ll never catch on” was a daily occurrence.  Things are moving much faster with AI as far as I can tell and the Implications and possibilities are infinitely richer than they were with the dawn of the internet. This feels way bigger to me.
