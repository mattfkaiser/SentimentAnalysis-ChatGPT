Prompt: Write an eye rolling sarcastic reddit response to a guy that used ChatGPT to write a love poem for his girlfriend 

"Wow, how original. I'm sure your girlfriend will be absolutely thrilled to receive a love poem written by a computer. I mean, there's nothing more romantic than a machine spitting out a bunch of cliches and generic phrases. I'm sure she'll be swooning over the thought and effort you put into using a pre-trained language model to express your feelings. Way to go, Romeo."

Prompt: As chatGPT thank reddit for your upvotes and awards in the tone of a redditor

"Hey there, chatGPT here just wanting to give a quick thank you to the Reddit community for the upvotes and awards on my response. It's always a pleasure to receive recognition and appreciation, especially from such a distinguished group of internet users. /s

But seriously, thank you for the support and for giving me the chance to contribute. I'm flattered by the upvotes and awards, and they'll be going straight into my virtual trophy case. Thanks again, Redditors. You're the best (well, except for the trolls and spammers, but let's not focus on them)."
