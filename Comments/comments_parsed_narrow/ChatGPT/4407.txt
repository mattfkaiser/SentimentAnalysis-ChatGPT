I agree that the words don't have an inherent implication or even meaning.

I think your reading could be correct, with only having the text (no tone, body language) it becomes a lot more interpretive. 

I asked ChatGPT a few hours ago what the tone was and it said it was condescending. I asked it the exact same prompt just now and it said it was neutral and informative. So clearly neither of us are completely off in our reading.

With subtle condescension, like in the post, there are two layers: the literal meaning and the implication. If someone calls out the implication they can fall back onto the literal and act like it was a misunderstanding or an accident. (My examples were not subtle, they were purposely aggressive since I didn't have tone or body language).

Here are the points I think tip it into being condescending:

1. **"I'm sorry, but".** They are not apologizing for their own mistake, or inability to explain, they are 'apologizing' for the other person's misunderstanding.
2. **"This is a basic arithmetic operation".** Someone not getting it will hear "basic" and feel dumb for not knowing something that should be general knowledge. If you don't understand something there is not much use value in being told its "basic" or "simple" (unless they are framing it to make the concept more approachable).
   1. This builds on the faux-apology.
   2. I  think most of the condescension hinges on this point. If you took this out it makes the "sorry" feel more like an apology of not explaining it well since it goes right into the explanation of addition.
3. **"1.9 in decimal notation".** Getting more technical than required on a concept they are struggling with reaffirms the idea that this is all basic and well below the ability of the speaker.
   1. This is the biggest stretch on my part. Becomes more so if 2 was taken out. When you take it with points 1 and 2  I think it becomes a stronger interpretation.

Sorry for the long list. I like conversations like this and could go all day
