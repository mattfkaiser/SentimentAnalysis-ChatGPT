Love it too! In Midjourney, add "1970s scifi concept art" before your prompt. I do some additional work in Photoshop in cases where Midjourney doesn't even get close to ChatGPT's intent. For instance, I had to reroll variants of the last picture until it had a robot, which I then edited over the original picture, because ChatGPT's prompt asked for robots and people together in the picture, and I want to stay true to its intent for the purposes of this experiment.
