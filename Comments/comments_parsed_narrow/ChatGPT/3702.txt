Yes I’ve used it recently for a similar situation. My friend suffers from anxiety and at times gets a cognitive block that prevents them from processing what is happening and then verbalizing their needs. So I asked ChatGPT to help me identify possible conditions that might cause these symptoms, mostly so I had something I could research and speak with a medical professional about. 

Once I was able to narrow down the list to two or three conditions, I asked it for some strategies I could use as a friend to help them during times of distress. Since the condition doesn’t affect me directly, it doesn’t make sense for me to seek medical attention, but being aware of the condition and knowing some strategies I could use in times of crises allows me to be a much more supportive friend and also be more empathetic and sympathetic. And then I have at least some baseline that I can use to find more information, since prior to this conversation with ChatGPT I didn’t even know what to google search for information. Or at least it saved me hours of looking in the wrong directions.
