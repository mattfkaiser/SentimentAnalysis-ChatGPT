I certainly welcome a different perspective (and I am by no means an expert here), but I'm having a little trouble understanding your argument.

I agree that rote memorization does have its place - I was a child of the "try using your emotions to feel math" age, and I desperately wish I had focused on memorizing times tables. That being said, I suppose I should be clearer: my thoughts were regarding ChatGPT as it relates to high school and college education, not elementary school. There are totally different objectives in learning, at different education levels.

As for elementary school children and the concept of time and the rapid acceleration of technology, I'm not exactly sure how that is connected.
