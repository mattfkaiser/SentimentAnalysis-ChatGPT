Simply answering the question, without scrolling through all the comments, my answer is that it depends. In direct answer, yes, using chat gpt to write the whole letter, or eulogy how I'm interpreting, is insensitive or impersonal - which I'd describe as unethical, but each to their own. 

But using it as a tool to help with structure, secondry collective ('<2021') perspective, and a spell check is different. 

I see chat gpt as a new 'IOT', and from that perspective I ask - would you say it's acceptable to 'google' for similar advice, as you are?



Using solely chatgpt for your answer - potentially unethical 
Using chatgpt to articulate your emotion and words - potentially beautiful
