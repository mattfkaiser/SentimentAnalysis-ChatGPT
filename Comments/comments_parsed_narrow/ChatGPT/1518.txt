I prompted generate a personal branding strategy plan using 48 Laws Of Power and The Art Of Seduction. Then I gave it details about me:

\- Biography (detailed)  
\- Core values (What causes I would publicly fight for)  
\- Potential PR damaging things about me (What could get me "cancelled")  
\- Public figures whose public image I admire (so ChatGPT has a reference)   


Please be careful feeding it names, phone numbers, personal details and other sensitive information. If need be, you can pretend that you're a brand strategist and the person whose information you're sharing is your client)
