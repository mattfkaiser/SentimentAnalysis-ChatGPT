Yeah itâ€™s pretty amazing. I gave it the facts and the evaluation criteria and it struck a great balance between advocating for me, highlighting my accomplishments, and being humble and vulnerable about the mistakes I made, how I learned, and how grateful I was to my team. And if phrased it in the language they want to hear. 

I was feeling a little self conscious about not doing enough last year, and not really fitting all the criteria. But somehow ChatGPT showed me that I did great and was a big asset to the company. I think a lot of ppl struggle to self-advocate and could use this.
