If you know something about programming (OP, I am looking at you!), you would understand that replacing programmers is not going to be as easy as most people think. Yes, it can replace a lot of scripting, but in the dystopian future of tomorrow that you present, programmers will have the hellish job of debugging complex code bases written by AI instead of writing their own. And what of code where performance is paramount and you have to carefully understand what each line is doing and in which sequence? In my own experiments with ChatGPT 4 it is saving me time for small tasks, but it also hallucinates quite frequently, so it is helpful, but not by a huge amount. Code pilot also is a nice tool, but feels more like auto complete on steroids at the moment (again helpful, but nothing without which I wouldn't be able to work). Regarding the recent plugins (which I also am playing around) - who will write the APIs that it so nicely uses? Who will deploy and maintain the infrastructure? My feeling is that people get easily impressed by surface feats, but don't really go into the details of how complex modern development is and how many things you have to know to deploy production-grade applications.
