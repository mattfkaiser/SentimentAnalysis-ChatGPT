I quit trying to use Bing chat because it insists on giving truncated answers. ChatGPT with GPT-4 will give me 4 pages of text (with continues) if it needs to. Bing acts like someone told it nothing should ever be longer than what can fit on an index card.

So far I have found Bing's so-called access to GPT-4 to be useless.

If someone else has had a different experience--I'd love be corrected on this. Maybe I'm just using Bing wrong somehow.
