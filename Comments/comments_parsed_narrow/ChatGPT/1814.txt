Okay, I am probably going to get a lot of downvotes for this but anyway

I don't think it is unethical, unless you go telling people around you that you did so (it won't be unethical even then but it would put people off)

Speaking as someone who lost her dad at 20 out of nowhere in the middle of uni exams, I was too devasted to do anything. Make arrangements, support my mom, string together sentences. We aren't Christians but if someone had asked me to do deliver a eulogy while I was morning and I could use ChatGPT, I would.

Now I don't know what your circumstances are, how your father passed (may he rest in peace) or how old you are. But I believe that no matter what the circumstances are, or how old you are, it is devastating to lose a parent, someone who has literally been there your whole life. How are you to go living without them there? How are you supposed to take care of things, yourself and others? I am sure there are a million things you need to do now. So it's okay. It's okay if you outsource something to AI and feel like it will do the job. Cut yourself some slack. It's fine. This is a public eulogy, and you can always write a letter to him yourself and keep it between the two of you.

Take care, and hugs.
