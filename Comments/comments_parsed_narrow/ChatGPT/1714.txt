It seriously annoys me how everyone just sees Sam Altman as the chatGPT CEO and the concerned AI guy now, completely ignoring the rest of his origin story. It's about as ridiculous as the selective amnesia about Musk. Altman used to be the big guy behind Y combinator, mentoring some of Silicon Valley's most competitive startups and teaching them how to break into the market. He was rich, famous, and extremely well connected long before touching anything AI related. AFAIK he didn't even have any affinity with the field of AI. He is a former startup founder, turned mentor, turned venture capitalist, and Silicon Valley personified, incl the dark parts of it. Valley founders are not known for their awareness nor concern for the needs of the wider world, and their talk about doing good for humanity is usually just the elevator pitch.

Neither of these two camps are sincere about their reasons, just trying to stir public sentiment into a direction they'd personally benefit from.
