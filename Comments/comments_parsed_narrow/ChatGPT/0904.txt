Actually, I’ve been researching out exactly what would be the process to program an AI copilot capable of playing a board game. It’s not good news for non-programmers. There is no simple system use chatGPT to program a game, or a rules lawyer, player assistant, copilot - it can’t read your well-crafted logical game rules and create an AI for you… yet. BUT! Coming soon: Workspaces, File Uploads, Profiles and other upgrades could make this possible. There are great YouTube videos and get you started.
