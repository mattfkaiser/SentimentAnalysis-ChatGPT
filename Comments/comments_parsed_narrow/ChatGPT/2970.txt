Isnt math a language tough? Mathematicians say it is, So i dont understand how it would be difficult for chatgpt to communicate in it. A computer basicly speaks in 1 and 0 so its already extremely good at calculating things much faster than a human?
Maybe 1+1 is 1+1 and not 2 as we always were tought. Afterall 1+1 is nothing but 1+1,  it doesnt always merge up into two? 1 can be an x and the other 1 can be an y? Therefor making 1+1 into 1 and 1,  and not always 2? Is this why chatgpt doesnt really calculate for us? Maybe it understand math more and better than us.
