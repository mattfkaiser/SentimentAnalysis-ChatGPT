That perspective is totally understandable and relatable. 

I’ll add one additional perspective:
- I’m seeing “AI” come up with ideas and concepts (like OP’s prompts) that I *could* come up with, but would take me ages.

For example, Op’s prompt. I’ve had some very similar ideas over the years. Over… the *YEARS*… 

I think about the best or most creative ideas I’ve had over the last 30 years, and while I’m proud of them, they fit easily on a list that ChatGPT can spit out in a minute while you’re on the crapper. 

That to me has been my humbling perspective-  not that it’s ideas are or are not unique, but that it can do in a moment what I was able to invent in a lifetime.
