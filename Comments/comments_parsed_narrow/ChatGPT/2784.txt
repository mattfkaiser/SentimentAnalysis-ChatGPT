Is it possible to prompt chatGPT on various definitions so that it actually does try to pick randomly?

Also it's interesting to think of what the human mind does when asked to pick a random number. I bet anything it's similar - lots of numbers would be commonly picked by people, and we don't actually have a RNG in our brains.
