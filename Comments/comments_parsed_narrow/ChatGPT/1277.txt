What were people expecting? ChatGpt to do your job for you? Sure, maybe in the future if it's integrated correctly it could take over some of the workload, but the human decision making and physical labor is always going to be required. For example, a forester has to make decisions on a constantly changing basis and go to the woods to field check logging or reforestation work. All that chat gpt is good for is giving you information on job specifics. it's not going to out-decision-make you, because it simply isn't intimately knowledgeable of the regulations and policies you work under. it would need to be a company-wide integration, possibly province/state-wide
