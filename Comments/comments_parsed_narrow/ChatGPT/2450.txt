IIRC there was news that said AI can be a really good lawyer. Which makes sense because a good amount of work is trawling through case studies and picking out previous judgements that are relevant. And also it can easily understand the procedures and processes necessary. 

But I would dare say that it's just at the point of being a good legal assistant level. (Sorry actual legal assistants - I take no responsibility if your office is replacing you with chatGPT)
