Ah, I hope I have more students like you! You confirmed my assumptions -- at least for serious students. As a teacher, I feel that it's not *how* a student learns that is important, but *that* a student learns. If chatGPT opens new avenues for processing information, that's great.

Also, everyone knows that the first draft is always the hardest. If AI can help you get through it, I see no problem. I suffered so much in college not being able to write my assignments in time -- I used to hide from my professors when I didn't hand in a paper on time!
