This reminds me a lot of the old computers that used to fill rooms. They cost what hundreds of millions as well in todays money? Look at where we are now. A lot of people say ah it's just another hype. Blud, blud, blud... It's not about chatgpt per se. It's what this means in just ten, fifteen years time and so on. I for one do not welcome our new AI overlords lol
