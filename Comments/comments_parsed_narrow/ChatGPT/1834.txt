Firstly I’m sorry for your loss, I’m sure it must be a difficult time. Secondly, I don’t think it needs to be all of nothing. I know it can be very difficult to find the words you want to say about a loved one when they pass. You can use ChatGPT as a tool to help get your thoughts out, to help you word parts you’re struggling with. To re-write sections you aren’t happy with. To get inspiration for things you may not have thought to cover yourself. You don’t have to have it 100% written by ChatGPT. Just make sure that whichever way you go, that what you say is a true representation of how you feel and that you include the personal experiences and memories you held together.  

It is very common when writing eulogies or speeches for weddings etc for people to look online for inspiration and ideas, ChatGPT is just another tool like that to help you get there.
