Because the "well articulated" response from chatgpt is just a string of words built by a probability algorithm. Any meaning you extract from it comes from yourself. There is no real communication, there is no back and forth, there is no comprehension or empathy or connection, and therefore it will not fix your loneliness. You might as well talk to a teddy bear and imagine the responses.
