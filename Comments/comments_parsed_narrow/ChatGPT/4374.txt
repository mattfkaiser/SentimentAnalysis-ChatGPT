The amount of Germans down here who are confusing themselves in the comments is impressive.

The phrase we're trying to translate, as I understand it, is an idiom for "I do not (intellectually) understand this."

In my opinion, the translation best suited would be "Ich versteh nur Bahnhof" which means "I only understand train station". 

If you want to keep referencing a language, it's "Ich versteh nur Spanisch" which means "I only understand Spanish"

However (!) it needs to be "I only understand" and not "to me it sounds" Because the translation for "Das klingt für mich spanisch" means "that sounds strange/fishy to me" and not "this sounds unintelligible to me".

There is also the word "Fachchinesisch" which refers to scientific language being unnecessarily complicated. So in that context, You could also say "das ist alles Fachchinesich" "all of that is scientific mumbo jumbo" but that phrasing doesn't factor in your subjective viewpoint.

The one with the bohemian village is also one I've never heard of, but I'd imagine it to be a regional thing from a region I'm not from. In the ChatGPT version, the idiom was grammatically wrong though. It should be "das sind für mich böhmische Dörfer"
