Wow! Awesome idea! As long as chatgpt doesnt screw it up ðŸ˜‚.  I spend a lot of time giving the finger to my computer screen each time I look up a recipe. Really donâ€™t need a 10 page back story along with slow loading advertisements filled with buggy code that crash the browser right before you get to the recipe.
