This is what Iâ€™m concerned about as someone currently majoring in computer science. My professors have all already talked about ChatGPT and courses are already being adapted to fit a world where AI can write basic code. Since ChatGPT is currently pioneering language based models, everyone is just gonna jump on that wagon and OpenAI is just gonna get richer. Nobody is gonna want to make new ML models if a good one already exists.
