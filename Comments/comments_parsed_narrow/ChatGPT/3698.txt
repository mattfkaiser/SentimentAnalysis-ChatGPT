I use it for counseling and feel one thousand times better talking to Chatgpt than a therapist. I actually did start seeing a therapist this week because Chatgpt adds “please seek a real person” to every tid bit and I feel guilty lol But I really doubt I stick with real person therapy because I love Chatgpt. Little bit of a sad state of affairs but 🤷🏻‍♀️
