Well... Let's ask it:  


 

As an AI language model, I can provide some insights into why some users may perceive ChatGPT as becoming "more stupid." However, it's important to note that I am an instance of ChatGPT and not involved in the development or maintenance of the model itself. My responses are based on patterns and information available up until September 2021.

There could be a few reasons why some users might perceive ChatGPT as less intelligent or accurate than before:

&#x200B;

1. \*\*Inherent limitations:\*\* ChatGPT, like other language models, has inherent limitations. It can generate plausible-sounding responses based on patterns it has learned from training data, but it may not always possess comprehensive or up-to-date knowledge. It doesn't have access to real-time information and its responses are based on the data it was trained on.

2. \*\*Changing user expectations:\*\* Over time, as users interact with ChatGPT more frequently, their expectations might change. Initially, the novelty and impressive capabilities of the model could have created a perception of greater intelligence. However, as users become more familiar with the model's limitations and repetitive responses, their expectations might shift, leading to a perception of reduced intelligence.

&#x200B;

3. \*\*Vulnerability to misinformation:\*\* ChatGPT relies on pre-existing data to generate responses. If it encounters inaccurate or false information during training, it may unknowingly reproduce that information in its responses. Additionally, if users provide incorrect or misleading information during interactions, ChatGPT might incorporate those inaccuracies into its responses. It's crucial to fact-check information received from any source, including AI models.

&#x200B;

It's important to remember that AI models like ChatGPT are tools created by humans and can have limitations. Developers continuously work on improving these models, addressing biases, and making them more reliable, but perfection is challenging to achieve.

When using AI-generated information, it's always advisable to verify and fact-check the information from reliable and trusted sources. Critical thinking and human judgment remain essential in evaluating the accuracy of any information, including that provided by AI models.
