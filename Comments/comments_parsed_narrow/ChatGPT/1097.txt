I do a lot of writing for work and thinking a bit about the process, if I were a teacher I'd consider teaching and grading on the process as much as the output.  IOW show their work.    


I would include chatGPT as a tool for refinement in that process and possibly focus the teaching on understanding the structures that chatGPT outputs and how to make it their own.
