Exactly. ChatGPT is a great tool, but it has a few flaws. 

1. It doesn’t know if what it is saying is correct, despite presenting the information as fact. I tried quizzing it on a tv show and it spat out completely false information as though accurate (completely wrong episode numbers and plot points). 

2. It is pretty easy to spot because it writes in a particular way. Sure, you can overcome that by completely rewriting things, but then students have at least done some work and hopefully understood what they wrote. They are still learning and just using ChatGPT like an efficient textbook.

I’m not sure how accurate AI checkers are, but a professor would quickly learn to spot it if they use it.
