I'm torn about this use of ChatGPT. On one hand, it gives a lot of people going through tough times some needed help. On the other hand, I sorta think this kind of technology isn't really mature enough yet to do this in a responsible way. It's essentially dispensing medical advice. I do see this as a potential use of it on the horizon, though. I just worry about using it for it right now. Not that I would encourage anyone to quit doing it if it helps you. By all means, if it's been a net positive in your life, go for it, but never forget that you're talking to an unconscious software Chinese Room. Sooner or later, it's going to shit out an output that is very unwise. So just stick to using it as a conversational partner. Conversation is a really potent kind of therapy in and of itself.
