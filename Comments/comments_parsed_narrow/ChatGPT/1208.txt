>it's crazy to think about the degree to which generative AI is  capturing the conversation everywhere. All the wild predictions and  exaggerations of ChatGPT and its ilk on social media, the news,  government comms, industry PR, and academia papers... Is all that  warranted?

Be careful about confusing "the conversation in my bubble" with "the conversation everywhere."  You're seeing a lot about it because you and people like you are interested in it, and you are probably clicking on stories about it more than other stories.   Doesn't mean everyone is.
