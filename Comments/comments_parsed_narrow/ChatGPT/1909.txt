“Not even remotely a replacement for google” is hyperbole.

It’s a replacement for 2/3 of the examples you suggested above.

My go to process is ask ChatGPT first, if I don’t get a good feeling about the answer I google second or re-prompt GPT to narrow it down.

It is very much my preferred searching tool.
