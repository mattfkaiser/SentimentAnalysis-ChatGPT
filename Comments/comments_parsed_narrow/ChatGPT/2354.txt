I looked in the IOS AppStore for a new  official “ChatGPT app for IOS” like this OP announced. I see innumerable hard-to-distinguish such apps whit pop up when I search for this, all saying they are powered by ChatGPT 3 or 4: Genie AI chatbot, AI Chat, Chat with Ask, Goat Chat, Genius AI Chat, AI Chatbot, AskMe, ChatOn, AI Chatbot Nova, Roboco, AI Chatbot Essay Writer, and Frank. I wonder how many of these make how much money for the operators from ads or subscriptions, and how many harvest data while acting as the middleman, skimming business plans, or getting insider information on profit and loss figures, to guide the operator’s investments.  If there is an “official” one, how do I identify it?
