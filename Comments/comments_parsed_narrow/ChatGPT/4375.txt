Well it translated it literally when translating to german. A better translation regarding the meaning of the saying (but not the literal one) would be

"Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof" 

It means the Same as "its all greek to me" but if youd literally translate the german saying into english youd get: "i only understand train station". I see Chatgpt still struggles with sayings.
