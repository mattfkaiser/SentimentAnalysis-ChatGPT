That runs directly counter to the meaning of what creativity is. Many people have created things that were entirely new and that the world had never seen before.

It may apply theories from physics to concrete problems, but it will never invent new ones like Einstein did. It can write code, but it would never come up with an innovation like ChatGPT itself.
