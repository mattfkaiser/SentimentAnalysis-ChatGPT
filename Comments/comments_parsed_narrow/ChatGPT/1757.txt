AI can definitely amplify creativity, and in this case, help write a eulogy. I think the problem is how much the user relies on the tool. 

OP can input the eulogy they have already written and ask ChatGPT for improvements with formatting/grammar. I think that’s an ethical use.
If OP has nothing to input expect some information about their father and has Chat right the whole thing for them, that seems dystopian, and even a little disrespectful.

I think it’s the same thing with art. Use it to help your vision, not to make it for you
