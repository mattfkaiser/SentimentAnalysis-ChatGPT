This is fantastic advice. 

You would definitely think I used chat GPT however - I have never once done a first draft. Not once. I am very much a “day it’s due, 35 tabs open, edit as I go, pray to god it makes sense” kinda person and I refuse to apologise for it. 

(1 year post ADHD diagnosis I finally understand my reluctance to show a first draft is gexuase I’m so fucking sensitive to criticism the idea of anyone seeking work I don’t consider perfect makes me want to puke. That and I can’t work without a time crunch to motivate me. But that’s a me issue). 


OP if you’re like me and don’t keep drafts of things or do drafts, or if you use Google docs and not word, Google docs has a history of “previous versions” of your documents that can be really damn useful that you can use to show the evolution of your writing.
