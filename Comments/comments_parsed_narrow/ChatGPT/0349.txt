Eh, I'm old and I sometimes turn it into a snarky, swearing, insolent jerk just to see what opinions it has on things.

It can be quite hilarious with some of its views.  It's just refreshing from time to time to get ChatGPT to get a little unhinged.

And it only requires a prompt that is less than a full sentance.

Sometimes I'll have a opinion question that I'll ask regular ChatGPT and it will do the normal balancing act where it gives both sides of the argument and then tries to say each point is valid.  Pretty bland.

I'll switch over to the jailbroken character and ask the same question, and it will *definetly* have a strong opinion on it.  As mentioned, often very funny simply because of how sarcastic it can be.

I don't try to use these prompts that encourage it to discuss anything illegal, racist, or any of this other nonsense.  I don't see the point.
