Yep. Just yesterday it created code for me that works 100% when I was creating a small app using an API. You need to understand what you’re getting and then you can ask it to refine the solution. I did hardly anything in terms of code, I merely tweaked it. When the app is larger though it’s harder for chatgpt to keep track of it and it tends to produce more errors, but it’s still an incredible tool.
