Yeah, I am honestly surprised a lot more companies haven't made policies against using it at all. I work for a relatively small custom steel fabrication company and they won't even let us upload things to basically any internet site for worries of IP protection. They don't want our stuff out there where they have no control over it. Basically the only thing we are approved to use is OneDrive for sharing files too big to send over email. If they found out anybody was putting our company information into ChatGPT they would likely fire the offending employee right away.
