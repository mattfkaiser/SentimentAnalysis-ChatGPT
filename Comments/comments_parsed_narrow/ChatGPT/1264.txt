I have a coworker (software development) who keeps saying chatgpt can code for us. I keep telling him that's amazing you should use it. He doesn't use it. I've tried using it, and found it less helpful than Google. I'm sure everyone here will say "you just aren't using it right" but I don't know what to say to that. I watched lectures on how to use it, tried those techniques. Still not as good as a Google search. Not sure what to tell you. This just feels like another "computers will take all our jobs!!!" fad, just like big data, machine learning, etc.
