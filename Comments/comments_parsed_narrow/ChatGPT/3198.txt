To simplify your analogy a bit, when deciding if chat gpt is an augmentation / improvement of an existing technology (the internet, search engines) versus a replacement technology (not a horse pulling cars, but a total horse replacement):

What you say to back up your claims? So far, it doesn't seem to be whole sale replacing our efforts in programming, creative arts, etc. It seems to be on the whole an augmentation. In other words: in your analogy what is the horse? What is the technology that is put out to pasture? Where is the unemployed human labor?

(That's not to say that this isn't the predecessor to a future technology that will wholesale replace say, graphic designers, programmers, lawyers, accountants etc.)
