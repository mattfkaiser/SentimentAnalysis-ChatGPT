I hope there is someday an AI “Firefox” that is privacy centric and run by a non-profit. But the good news is that we already have an “Internet Explorer” AI called Bing Chat and an “early version of Opera” AI in Google Bard.

I hardly even use Chat GPT nowadays because it’s not the best product out there at this point. Bing is way better at finding factual answers due to its search capabilities, and Bard is far less locked down than ChatGPT if you want to ask it about anything with an ethical bent or anything consciousness-related. And there will be many more, and better, very soon at the rate that progress is being made on this.
