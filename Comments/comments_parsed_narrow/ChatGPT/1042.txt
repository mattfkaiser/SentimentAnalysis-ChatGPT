I don't think it was wrong to write it your whole life lmao. It's just that ChatGPT starts every single e-mail like this (even though it's a relatively uncommon way to start e-mails), so now it's much easier to assume that an e-mail was AI written if it starts with the sentence "I hope this email finds you well".
