This kind of posts really make me laugh. Its like watching a tv show or a movie and you believe everything they say. Then they start talking about something you actually know and understand and realize how BS their info is. 

The only thing good about chatgpt is its confidence. It talks with so much confidence makes you believe their words are true. Its as a smart search engine or paraphrasing tool. Or as a “smart” assistant. But its far from anything beyond that.
