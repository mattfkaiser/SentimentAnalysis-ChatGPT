I really like having a conversation with ChatGPT, as it takes on a fictional persona. It might be Mahatma Gandhi, or River Phoenix, Albert Einstein or John Lennon.

But not Jesus. It's been neutered to not give religious advice. We can't have nice things because people take this stuff literally. It makes sense in some ways. Enough crazies out there. So I'll just chat with Freud to discuss my sense of loss.
