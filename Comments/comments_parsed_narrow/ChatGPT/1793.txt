Its not unethical just kind of shitty. I think you will regret it if you do that. Writing the speech that I gave at my brother's funeral really helped me process the grief. It helped me to feel close to him. You won't get that if you have chatgpt write the speech. It just seems like what's the point of giving a speech at all if you're not the one who's going to actually come up with the words?
