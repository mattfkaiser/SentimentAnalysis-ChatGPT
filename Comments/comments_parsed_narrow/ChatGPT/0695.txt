Soon, OpenAI will make it illegal to bypass 10 pages of text outlining the author's story, their parents, the place where their dog is from, the history of eggs, the names of pet chickens with appropriate affiliate links to amazon merch, the discussion what was first egg, chicken or chatgpt, etc...

Mark my words.

IT WILL BE ILLEGAL

As an Ai model I can't bypass Ai generated BS because it is important for the future of society.
