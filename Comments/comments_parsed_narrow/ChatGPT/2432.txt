LOL I am not a laywer! Cause if I did claim that it'd be a prosecutable offense. Yes, GPT-4, we know that, way to troll some karma.

What you envious professionals whom spent all that money on school don't get is that ChatGPT can look and act just like a fancy google, input text, output results. If you just dabble with ChatGPT, dink around, even put a bit of effort into it, you won't be impressed. You'll fall back to your training, and be content. And feel superior. That's cool. Until you witness what deep prompt engineering talent with all the related experience to the prompted subject matter - minus the license - can do with ChatGPT. That's why the OP was doing, and others are also. I'm good with taking some flaming over this because I've been ahead of this curve for a long time. You have no idea how much in jeopardy your job is. Mine too, but I'm adapting, you're criticizing.
