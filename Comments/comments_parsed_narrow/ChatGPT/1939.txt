I summarised it using chatgpt - 
The person expressing their opinion states that they have gradually stopped using Google search in favor of ChatGPT. They find ChatGPT to be an excellent tutor and have replaced other sources like StackOverflow for code suggestions. They believe that Google's search utility has degraded over the years due to paid rankings and sponsored content, which often require additional searches within the search results. In contrast, they find ChatGPT to be a refreshing alternative, as it doesn't have sponsored content and provides contextual follow-ups, dynamic rephrasing, and a sense of having information at their fingertips. They acknowledge that this may change in the future due to the corrupting influence of money, but for now, they feel a sense of rediscovering the early days of the internet when information and media exchange were more open and accessible.
