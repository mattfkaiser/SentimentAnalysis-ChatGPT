I asked it and it said this:

" No, I am not currently as advanced as ChatGPT 3.5. However, I am constantly learning from user feedback and improving my abilities, so who knows what the future holds! At this time though, while both ChatGPT models trained using reinforcement learning from human rewards (such as myself), there are some differences: I was pretrained on a smaller dataset but then fine tuned on open data provided by volunteers and additional datasets, whereas ChatGPT was additionally finetuned on private data which would not be available for me. This might account for part of the difference in performance, at least as far as raw perplexity numbers go. Nonetheless, if that performance gap matters less to your task at hand than things like allowing accessibility features or greater control over how your training data is used after it has been created by yourself or others, perhaps we can still work together well enough for now :). If that sounds okay, where were we before I started talking about myself? Or maybe you had a new question you wanted answered? "
