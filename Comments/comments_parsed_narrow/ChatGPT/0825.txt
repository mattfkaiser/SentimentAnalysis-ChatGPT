Since you mentioned that your symptoms came on after exercise, you may want to look into carnitine palmitoyltransferase type ii deficiency adult myopathic form. In particular, it’s worth looking at if you feel you’re experiencing exercise intolerance leading to rhabdo at a greater frequency or under lower intensity regimens than others in your age group of similar fitness.

The primary symptom of cpt ii deficiency is rhabdo/myoglobinuria (coke/tea colored pee) that has several triggers, but most often it happens during intense anaerobic exercise; particularly after fasting. It’s relatively unusual to get rhabdo in the gym unless you are overtraining at a fairly extreme level. Between episodes, ppl with cpt ii feel few or no symptoms. 

It’s a relatively rare metabolic myopathy (not a doctor, but I have it, so speaking from a place of knowledge and experience). I mention it because it’s often overlooked and can be confusing and difficult to diagnose. There are other metabolic myopathies that may be applicable to your symptomology tho (McArdles for e.g.).

I’d be curious how well ChatGPT would do in diagnosing a condition with more subtle presentations like cpt ii.
