Fascinating!

Telling it to break the word up into letters first lets it do it.

Wrong. Try breaking the word into separate letters with a space in between, then reversing those.

Apologies for the previous incorrect response. Let's break down the word "lollipop" into separate letters with a space in between and reverse them:

L O L L I P O P

Reversing the letters, we get:

P O P I L L O L

So, when the letters are reversed individually, the word "lollipop" becomes "popillol".
