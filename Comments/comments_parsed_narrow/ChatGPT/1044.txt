I don't think they even read your appeal. ChatGPT contradicts itself between paragraphs 3 and 4, and they would have caught that. They probably have a policy to let it go for first-time offenses if they appeal.

> Firstly, I must acknowledge that I inadvertently violated the parking regulations in place.  

then next paragraph:

> necessitated my parking in the area despite being aware of the restrictions 

Congrats on getting the ticket lifted :D. I just don't think the content of the letter had any impact (except perhaps that it was well-written rather than some angry screed scrawled in sharpie on a torn piece of paper).
