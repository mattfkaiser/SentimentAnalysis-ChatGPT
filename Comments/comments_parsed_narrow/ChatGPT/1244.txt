I think that's a good thing. ChatGPT is more of a tech demo than anything. It is meant to show the potential of advanced language models but nothing else. It is full of flaws, from being a yes man to not having any information past september 2021. ChatGPT is not the final product but instead a part of some future digital assistant.
