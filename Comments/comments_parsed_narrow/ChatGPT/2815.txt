I really wonder about the people who say "ChatGPT will never be good at creative writing". 1: All writing is derivative of *something* anyway, and 2: This is actually funny.

"No commercial viability" my ass. This kind of writing *will* bring readers to a page. There's a desperate undersupply of satire in the world, and if ChatGPT can provide it, why not.
