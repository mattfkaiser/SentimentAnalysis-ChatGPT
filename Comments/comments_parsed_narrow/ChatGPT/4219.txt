Honestly, I agree, I sometimes feel like we're straight up using different AIs at this point, I've never even had to Google how to jailbreak it, or a specific prompt to get a quality answer for a specific topic.

In fact in my personal experience, 99% of the garbage answers I've gotten were entirely my fault, be it bad grammar, poor phrasing, lack of understanding of the field and terminology, or simply lazy vague prompts. 

My only advice for anyone out there getting bad answers is this: Don't use chatGPT to think for you, you are the one with a goal, you are the brain, chatGPT is your muscle.
