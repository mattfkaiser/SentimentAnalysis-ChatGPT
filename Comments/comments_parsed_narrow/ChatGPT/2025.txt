>what they are really in a frenzy about is political and social extrapolations from objective data.

This doesn't make sense. Where do you think Chap GPT, gets its data? If you don't believe that the data provided by the knowledge communities of a given topic (typically has high scrutiny if it is a legit topic) is legit, then Chat GPT wouldn't have access to "objective data" either. If you think Chat GPT runs statistical analysis and comes to conclusions after analyzing meta data research...that's not even close to its capabilities. It does ZERO analysis of information. Therefore, it can not extrapolate...and if it did, the amount of sourcing it would need to provide to show the results are representative would be pretty hefty.


Do you actually do any type of stat. analysis for work?? If so, I have additional follow up questions because this is a wild thought to have about the work we do lol
