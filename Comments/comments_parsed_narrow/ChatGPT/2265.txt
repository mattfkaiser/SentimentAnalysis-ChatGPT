This might help in the long run. I made a web application that lets you create chatbots with their own talking styles, personalities, etc. It utilizes ChatGPT's API so it's as powerful as ChatGPT.  


You can use it to create your own chatbot that adheres to your speech style. You can check it out here: [http://optitalk.net/](http://optitalk.net/)  


It's completely free to use btw, I recommend signing up tho since there's a 20 character limit for non registered users (to prevent spam).  


And before anyone asks, it's similar to [Character.ai](https://Character.ai) but it offers more control and is more stable and also has an API unlike chai.
