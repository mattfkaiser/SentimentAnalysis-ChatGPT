As others have stated, prompt engineering is really key - ask it to roleplay / pretend to be exactly what you want it to be - an expert in a field, a graduate level professor, etc. if the results are still undesirable and you have basic programming knowledge, using the API is the best option - you can system prompt it from the API (the default system prompt is “you are a friendly abs helpful chat it”, although I suspect they are slowly fine tuning the basic ChatGPT system prompt to be more safe for the public). Telling it what it is through the system prompt leads to outstanding results, although each query takes longer than using their website, and you pay a small amount for every token prompted and generated.
