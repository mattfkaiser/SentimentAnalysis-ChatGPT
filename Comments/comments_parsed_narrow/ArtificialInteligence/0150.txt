1. Love to see simple games being done with ChatGPT. This is a very simple game and I did something similar in Scratch years ago with simple textures, but that took hours.
2. Highly recommend putting the instructions of the game on the website you are playing it on.
3. Arrow keys and A/D should both be options to move the character in a 2D game. Just for the future OP.
4. If you really care about the game, then some balancing needs to happen. Right now it is not fun to play for more than 3 seconds. Character moves too fast, objects drop down too fast, things speed up way too much in a matter of seconds, etc.
5. Godspeed OP :)
