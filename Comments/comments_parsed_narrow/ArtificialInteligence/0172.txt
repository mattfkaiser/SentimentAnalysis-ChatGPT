Sure - and I don't have a problem with that. But that's not the same as replacing a bunch of graduate programmers as OP said. That's requiring someone to hand hold it through the process. Someone with programming knowledge. I have tried to get it to produce code I'm working on - but it just has no idea. I don't think ChatGPT professes to be able to write code to solve problems it has never seen in some form before. At least my attempts to get it to do that have failed.
