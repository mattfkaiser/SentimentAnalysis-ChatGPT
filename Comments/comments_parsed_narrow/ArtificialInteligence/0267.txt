Short answer: No

ChatGPT is inherently just a text generator. It doesn't even know the difference between an instruction or plain text. That's why prompt engineers can hack around chatGPT safety prompts and make him output uncensored stuff. 

However, the recent update like plugins may enable chatGPT to do other stuff beyond giving text responses.
