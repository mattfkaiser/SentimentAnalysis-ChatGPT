The skills required to write a well crafted paper, novel etc will be redundant. The key human input will be novel ideas and direction to the likes of chatGPT. 

I see a new renaissance of creative output as the number of people that can put that idea to ‘paper’ is dramatically increasing. Not to mention allowing those with disabilities to share their stories. 

So ye.. learn to use it. Don’t gatekeep. The box is open and isn’t closing.
