I would give both Google and chatgpt similar scores to answer my needs on the first question.

But chatgpt excellence is with the follow up questions.

What's union operator in sql? Google and chatgpt gives similar answers. Though chatgpt is more concise and easier to comprehend. 

How to use it to do this and that?
What are other ways to do it?
Etc


Now It becomes a landsliding victory for chatgpt
