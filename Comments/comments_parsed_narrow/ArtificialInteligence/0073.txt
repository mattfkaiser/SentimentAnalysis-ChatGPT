It opens, but id the default page which is 3.5 with a drop down I can change to 4. When I select 4 it takes me to the ...gpt-4 page, and when I just add -plugins it just resolves back to the default landing (3.5 with a dropdown to choose). Three different browsers, no Beta choice under settings anywhere (two of them I had never used with ChatGPT so no cache issues). I'm guessing it's not my turn yet (been trying for 2-3 days).
