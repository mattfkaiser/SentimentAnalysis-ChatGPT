I don't think that is the case, but with millions of people using ChatGPT for the equivalent of making a calculator read 'BOOBS' - figuring out ways to make it use profanity or say something racist of sexist for low level laughs - I can't see the people currently paying for the compute needed footing the bill forever. The death of free tier is inevitable or at least crippling of its capability is inevitable.
