Chat gpt gets the following leetcode problem incorrect: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

I'm guessing it's due to the fact that leetcode accepts incorrect answers, so there's a bunch of people on the wrong side of the dunning Kruger curve confidently posting incorrect solutions. If you explain to chatgpt how it's wrong, it can give a correct solution.
