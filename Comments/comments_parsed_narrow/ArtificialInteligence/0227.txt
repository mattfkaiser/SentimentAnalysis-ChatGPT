The funny thing is that the transformer architecture that makes all this possible came out of Google, so they should've been on top of it. Don't worry, they will catch up and probably soon. They have the resources and more importantly the requirement(if they want to survive) to do so. Google simply didn't allocate resources correctly to get the thing built fast enough. Google should have seen where openai was and where they were going  when gpt3 came out(or before) and pivoted at that point. I'm actually kind of astonished they didn't. It's not like openai hid everything until chatgpt came out. Either way I have no doubt that they are pouring every bit of energy into it as they can now.
