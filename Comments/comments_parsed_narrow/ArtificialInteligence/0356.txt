If you use ChatGPT to write a 'brilliant' essay for your history class - even if your professor cannot use a tool to 100% detect that you used this tool .. they could always say 'righto smarty pants .. since you wrote such a great essay you must really know your stuff .. tell me right know in your own words why you came to conclusions about this, this and that point .. and then expand on this point here and give me more detail about this."

If you didn't really write such a brilliant essay you'll be struggling to answer these questions and immediately show yourself to be a cheater ..  


(Of course you could ask ChatGPT to help you prepare for such a scenario!)  


(Either way, don't be afraid of ChatGPT .. but use it as a great tool in the same way as you might use Wikipedia .. if you just copied out a bunch of stuff on a history subject from there verbatim you'd get caught and - more importantly - you wouldn't learn much.  If instead you use both tools to help you really understand a subject and how to structure a good essay that carefully considers multiple viewpoints .. then you'll learn about the subject much better .. and be able to talk confidently about it for any follow-up questions)
