Why wouldn't they reveal which specific extension (?) it was. I guess it has been removed already anyway.

By not revealing the name of the extension, the security "firm" (fancy name for a business) makes people wonder what app or extension it is, and have eyes on the business, so their value goes up.

I tried asking Bing Chat, don't know if it dug the correct info: "According to the article you shared, the fake ChatGPT app is a **counterfeit ChatGPT browser extension** that was available for Chrome¹². It was laced with **infostealer malware** that collected all the data stored in the browser, including stored passwords and credit card information². The threat actors used the stolen Facebook credentials to take over accounts and change their profiles to resemble actress **Lily Collins**². This incident is also known as the **Lily Collins Hack**¹.
