This doesn't make sense to me. What is the rationale for "getting rid of school" before children have gone through adolescence and reached adulthood?

Generative AI isn't a panacea that perfectly solves all of the challenges that humans face throughout their lives. And ChatGPT isn't going to magically transform 13 year old children into fully functional adults. Quality education is still required.

The solution isn't "getting rid of school at eighth grade". Schools should (and assuredly will) adapt to the existence of new technology.
