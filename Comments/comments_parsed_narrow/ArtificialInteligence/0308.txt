It won't have consciousness but I disagree on it's hype. They can create it to do some amazing things. A machine that can break down human language in to learning and understanding will be a powerful tool. Can do just about anything. 

And humans are innovating the learning algorithm in machines, the machines are definitely capable of innovation themselves with that knowledge. They are already using them for engineering, medicine, microchips, nuclear fusion, etc. So AI can do incredibly innovative things, it's just chatgpt is the baseline of that. Just the breaking down of language, it will be the engineers and experts that turn that language learning in to powerful and innovative products.
