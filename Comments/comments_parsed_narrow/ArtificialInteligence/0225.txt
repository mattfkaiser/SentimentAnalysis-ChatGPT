I respectfully disagree. i think chatgpt4 is significantly better than chatgpt 3.5


Yes the filters and tokens are big parts of it but i think its more than that. The stories 3.5 does are fine (better than Bard), but the ones by GPT4 are sometimes so good its scary.



In terms of human IQ i think it gained at least 10 points. Also, you dismiss the improved filters as nothing, but according to Sam Altman, the filters are a huge factor in improving the AI. I don't fully understand why but i guess he knows more than us.
