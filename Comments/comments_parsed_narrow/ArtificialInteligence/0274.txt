I get that for some things but chat gpt still does get stuff wrong, so idk if it will totally get adopted. There are things that I can’t imagine ai being able to give us, because it’s ultimately following patterns and statistics for language. Movie reviews by ai won’t be very helpful. Asking for advice, or reading opinion columns on ai don’t really work. 


Plus, it will never be the ONLY thing we use - because it will have to gather info about current events somehow. We could use it for news, but there has to be actual news articles for ai to summarize - or else it won’t know the news. 

It’s like having a guy who can instantly scan all the books in the library and regurgitate the info. If we just rely on that guy, there won’t be any more books for him to regurgitate.
