I think we have to cut the lawyer some slack. I wrote about it yesterday but basically, I think busy people who see the beautiful candy results ChatGPT provides and are not technically saavy are very much at risk for doing this sort of thing. They are not idiots, necessary, just very busy and deceived into how easy ChatGPT makes everything seem.

I think I'm allowed to post links, so here's the medium article I wrote on it: [https://medium.com/@pagalvin/beyond-the-hype-why-we-should-cut-the-chatgpt-confused-lawyer-some-slack-cb242225cdcf](https://medium.com/@pagalvin/beyond-the-hype-why-we-should-cut-the-chatgpt-confused-lawyer-some-slack-cb242225cdcf)
