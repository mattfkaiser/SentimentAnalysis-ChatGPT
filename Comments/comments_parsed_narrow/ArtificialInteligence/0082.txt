I think the main reason why they made it is because chatgpt and most other chatbots just doesn't work in russia and therefore they don't have any competition whatsoever. Ah and also because "haha western fuckers we also can do that" and release just shitty stupid chatbot that no one gonna use.

Russian companies have stopped being original very long ago, even russians understand it.
