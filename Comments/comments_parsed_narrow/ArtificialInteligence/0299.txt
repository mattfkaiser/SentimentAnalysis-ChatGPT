I have found one area where BARD is possibly superior, and that’s at referencing and finding digitized material, Bing/ChatGPT frequently cites “lack of access” BARD is like “I’m Google, I know all things” especially for obscure books/information. A specific example was the book “Cosmogony” Bu Cyrus Teed of the Koreshan Cult, BARD was able to access the book and reference it for me while Bing or CharGPT were not. However I find that BARD seems to Hallucinate more… which makes me second guess all of its references more. How do you incorporate them into your work?
