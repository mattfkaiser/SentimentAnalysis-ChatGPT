It sounds like they want an exhaustive manual. OP - I would definitely recommend asking ChatGPT these questions. And do not trust everything you get back. Use it as a jumping off point. ChatGPT - will - “lie”.

What makes you think this is a joke? Let’s encourage others to be curious and ask questions. Especially for those “not in the know”.

Edit: I would go so far as to say don’t trust anything you get back. Simply don’t trust it and verify everything.
