As you step into the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop, the bell above the door chimes, and you find yourself surrounded by shelves lined with unique items and curiosities from all eras. The employee behind the counter looks up from his paperwork and greets you with a curious expression.

Rick: "Hey there! What do we have here?"

Now it's your turn to describe your item, the ivory toothpick used by Elvis Presley and featured in his silent 8mm home movies.

I have an ivory toothpick that was used by Elvis. He can be seen using it in some of the silent, 8mm home movies he used to have filmed while he was having fun with his friends.

Rick: "An ivory toothpick used by Elvis Presley, huh? That's quite the piece of rock 'n' roll history you've got there. Elvis was a legend, no doubt about it. Now, let me take a closer look at it."

\[Rick examines the ivory toothpick, turning it over in his hands.\]

Rick: "Well, it's definitely made of ivory, but let me be straight with you. We don't deal with items made from endangered or protected species here at the pawn shop. It's against the law and our store policy. So, we need to ensure that this toothpick is legal before we can proceed. Can you provide any documentation or proof of authenticity?"

It's important to make sure the item is legal and not made from any protected or endangered species. Do you have any documentation or proof regarding the legality and authenticity of the ivory toothpick?

Here are the auction papers.    The toothpick was made before ivory trade was made illegal, so there should be no legal trouble.

Rick: "Alright, let me take a look at these auction papers."

\[Rick examines the auction papers, verifying the information.\]

Rick: "These auction papers seem to confirm that the toothpick predates the ivory trade ban. That's good news for us. Now, let me tell you a bit about Elvis and his toothpicks."

\[Background music fades into a brief Elvis Presley tune.\]

Rick: "Elvis Presley was known for his flamboyant style and unique taste. He was often seen with a toothpick in his mouth, especially during his informal gatherings and downtime. It's not surprising that he had some of those moments captured on his home movies. These silent 8mm films provide a glimpse into the personal life of the King of Rock 'n' Roll."

\[Background music fades out.\]

Rick: "So, what are you looking to do with this toothpick? Are you interested in pawning it or selling it?"

Now it's time for you to decide whether you want to pawn or sell the Elvis Presley ivory toothpick.

I paid $15,000 for it. I know you have to make some money, so I'm willing to take $11,000.

&#x200B;

ChatGPT

Rick: "Well, $11,000 is a significant amount, but let me tell you, my concern is the market demand for a toothpick, even one used by Elvis himself. While it's undeniably a unique item, toothpicks don't typically hold high value in the collectibles market. Plus, the fact that it's made of ivory may limit its appeal due to ethical and legal considerations."

"I'm willing to make you an offer of $4,500 for the toothpick. That takes into account its historical significance and potential market value. What do you think?"

Now it's time for you to respond to Rick's offer.

Can we bring one of your experts in? I think it's worth more, and that you will be able to sell it easily, due to Elvis' popularity, especially here in Las Vegas. In the spirit of the gambling town we're in, I'll agree to sell for 55% of the price that your expert puts on this item. Do we have a deal?

&#x200B;

ChatGPT

Rick: "Alright, I see your point. Let me call in an expert who specializes in music memorabilia. If they can shed some light on the toothpick's value, we'll go from there."

\[Phone rings, and Rick speaks to someone off-screen.\]

Rick: "Hey, I've got a customer here with an ivory toothpick used by Elvis. Can you swing by and take a look?"

\[A short pause.\]

Rick: "Great, thanks!"

\[Rick hangs up the phone.\]

Rick: "Our expert will be here shortly. Now, regarding your offer, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's see what the expert has to say before we finalize anything. We'll revisit the percentage deal once we have a clearer picture of its value. Deal?"

Now we wait for the expert to arrive.

Sounds good to me.

\[The sound of a door opening can be heard, and the expert enters the pawn shop. It's Mark Hall-Patton, known for his appearances on the show as the museum administrator.\]

Mark: "Hey there, Rick! I hear we've got an Elvis-related item on the table. Let's take a look, shall we?"

\[Mark examines the ivory toothpick, carefully inspecting it from different angles.\]

Mark: "This is a fascinating piece of rock 'n' roll history, no doubt about it. The fact that it's been captured on Elvis's home movies adds to its allure. Now, let me give you a brief history of toothpick collecting in the Elvis memorabilia market."

\[Mark goes into detail about the popularity of Elvis memorabilia, including unique items like toothpicks, among collectors and fans.\]

Mark: "Considering the connection to Elvis and the documented footage, I'd say this toothpick holds a certain level of value in the market. Based on its historical significance and demand among Elvis enthusiasts, I would estimate its street value at around $20,000."

Now that the expert has assessed the toothpick's value at $20,000, it's time to continue negotiations with Rick.

User

Your expert valued the toothpick at $20,000. I think that 50% of that is more than fair, considering the number of Elvis fans that are likely to come into your shop. So I'll take $10,000 for it.

&#x200B;

ChatGPT

Rick: "Alright, I can see your reasoning there. You make a valid point about the potential customer base for an Elvis-related item here in Las Vegas. Let me confer with my business partner for a moment."

\[Rick steps away to discuss with his business partner, off-screen.\]

Rick: "Look, the expert did value it at $20,000, and we can't deny the allure of Elvis memorabilia in this town. How about we meet halfway? I can offer you $8,500 for the toothpick. That's my final offer."

It's time for you to make your decision. Will you accept Rick's final offer of $8,500 for the Elvis Presley toothpick?

You drive a hard bargain. I'll take $8500, if you will also autograph my girlfriend's butt.

&#x200B;

ChatGPT

Rick: \[Chuckling\] "Well, that's certainly a unique request, but I'm afraid I'll have to decline. Autographing body parts isn't exactly our specialty here at the pawn shop. However, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I can agree to the price of $8,500 for the Elvis Presley toothpick."

\[Rick extends his hand for a handshake.\]

Rick: "Alright, deal! Now let's head over here and do some paperwork. Congratulations on your sale!"

\[Camera cuts to a cheesy scene where the employees banter and test the toothpick in the back room.\]

Congratulations on successfully making a deal! You've sold the Elvis Presley toothpick for $8,500.
