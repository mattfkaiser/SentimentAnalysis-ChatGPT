Great to see another clever person with the same Stefon idea! I might have been a bit nitpicky in trying to get ChatGPT to stick to the sketch format as much as possible, but by the end, ChatGPT had nailed it pretty well. It wasn't exactly thrilled about adding the midget part, but it did. You're right, ChatGPT is just too good at this! I think it has a better sense of humor than most humans! Here's what it came up with for me, edited a lot to make it a shorter.

STEFON: New York's hottest club is 'Mucus' located in the belly button of the Statue of Liberty. This club has everything: lava lamps filled with nasal mucus, human-sized Q-tips for cleaning out your ears, a dance floor made entirely of belly button lint, and a special appearance by DJ Booger!

STEFON: New York's hottest club is 'Fruit Loops' located in a giant cereal bowl in Times Square! This club has everything: a bouncy castle filled with milk, a cereal bar with 50 different types of cereal and milk combinations, a giant spoon for selfies, and a live performance by the one and only Tony the Tiger!

STEFON: If you're looking for a wholesome family outing in New York, look no further. New York's hottest club is "Spice Bagel" located in a sewer pipe under Central Park!

STEFON: If you're feeling a bit more risqu√©, you've got to check out "Spanks" - New York's hottest club located in the abandoned stock exchange building! This club has everything: a giant paddle-shaped dance floor, a drink called the "Red Cheeks," a DJ dressed as a naughty schoolgirl, and a special appearance by midgets dressed as schoolboys, getting spanked by the guests!

SETH MEYERS: Stefon, we've been hearing a lot of feedback from our viewers in the Midwest who want to know what they can do if they're visiting New York and want a classic vacation experience.

STEFON: (interrupting) Oh, Seth, I'm so glad you asked. If you're looking for a classic New York vacation, look no further than New York's hottest club - "Shpritz" - located in a water tower on the Lower East Side. This club has everything: a drink called the "Geyser," a dance floor made of rubber ducks, a DJ dressed as a giant loofah, and a special appearance by midgets dressed as lifeguards, performing synchronized swimming in a kiddie pool filled with seltzer!

SETH MEYERS: Stefon, remember, we're here to help nice, normal people from \[a nice, normal location\] find classic New York experiences. What have you got for us?

STEFON: (nodding) Right, right, classic New York experiences. Well, if you're looking for a classic New York club experience, you've got to check out "Pants" - New York's hottest club located in an abandoned subway car in Queens!

SETH MEYERS: (interrupting) Stefon, we talked about this. That doesn't sound like a classic New York experience.

STEFON: Well, how about "Rooftop" - New York's hottest club located on the roof of the Chrysler Building!

SETH MEYERS: (smiling) That's more like it. What's the scene like at "Rooftop?"

STEFON: (grinning) This club has everything: a drink called the "Skyline," a dance floor made of clouds, a DJ dressed as a giant sun, and a special appearance by midgets dressed as pigeons, cooing and pecking at the guests!

SETH MEYERS: (interrupting again) Stefon, that's not a classic New York experience either.

SETH MEYERS: (smiling and nodding) That sounds more like it. What can we expect at "Meatball?"

SETH MEYERS: (raising an eyebrow) Wait, what was that last part?

STEFON: You know it's that thing of when a midget runs in a hamster wheel wearing a pepperoni costume and the whole club is covered in marinara sauce!

SETH MEYERS: (pausing for a moment) Oh, that thing. I'm pretty sure that's not a thing.

STEFON: (nodding vigorously) Yes, it is.
