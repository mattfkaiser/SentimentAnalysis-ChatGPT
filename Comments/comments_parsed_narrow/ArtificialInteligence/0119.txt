I remember the first time someone showed me Google. I was an art director at the time and thought “that thing is ugly but wow is it a huge improvement over Yahoo!” Yahoo was a directory based service before it was a search engine. It was revolutionary then started to suck.

Anyhow I can’t wait for ChatGPT to have more current info in it because the first time I used it I really felt like it was the future and the very idea of a search engine was no longer necessary, just like yahoo’s directory model.
