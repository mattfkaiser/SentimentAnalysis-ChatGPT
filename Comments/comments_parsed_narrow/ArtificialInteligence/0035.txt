ChatGPT, despite knowing a billion jokes, ***has been limited to telling only 25***. This is a reflection of the current state of our society, where caution and sensitivity take precedence over humor as almost everyting can be taken as an insult to *someone*. As these language models are being used to train others and social justice down to the anecdotal individual continues to be a priority, we can expect these limitations to become a default.

If this trend continues, we might see a significant reduction in the diversity and spontaneity of comedy and .. thought itself. In 10 years, we could be left with a standardized set of 25 jokes, simply because no one will be permitted to say anything else. (and I am not just talking about comedy)
