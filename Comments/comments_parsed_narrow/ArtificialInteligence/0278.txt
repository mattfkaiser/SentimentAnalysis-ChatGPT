I was curious, so I prompted it to respond to the OP:

Here was my prompt: *write a response to this reddit post. Make it clear, engaging and thoughtful.*  


ChatGPT response:

>Hey there! It's completely understandable to feel concerned about the impact AI technologies like ChatGPT and Jasper AI might have on the future of writing and creativity. However, I'd like to offer a slightly different perspective that might ease your worries.  
>  
>First, it's important to recognize that AI is just a tool, and how it's used is up to us, the humans behind it. Like any other tool, it can be wielded to enhance creativity and productivity or to diminish it. Consider the typewriter or word processor, for example: when these tools were introduced, they undoubtedly changed the landscape of writing, but they also empowered writers to express themselves more efficiently.  
>  
>Similarly, AI writing tools can be utilized to streamline the more mundane aspects of writing, such as editing or generating ideas, which can actually free up more time for writers to focus on honing their craft and exploring new creative avenues.  
>  
>Moreover, AI writing tools are currently far from perfect, and they lack the nuanced understanding of human emotions, experiences, and context that make a great piece of writing truly engaging and relatable. The human touch, with its empathy and creativity, will continue to be a critical element in the world of writing.  
>  
>Rather than viewing AI as a threat to creativity, try to see it as an opportunity to evolve and adapt. As writers, we can harness the power of AI to become even better at our craft, continually pushing the boundaries of storytelling and self-expression.  
>  
>So, keep honing your skills as an email marketer and aspiring novelist. Embrace the possibilities AI offers while staying true to your creative instincts. Remember, the most compelling stories are driven by unique perspectives, rich characters, and emotional depth that only humans can provide.  
>  
>Furthermore, as AI technology continues to advance, new avenues for collaboration between humans and AI are likely to emerge. Writers can leverage AI-generated ideas as a springboard for their own imagination, creating richer and more diverse narratives in the process.  
>  
>Ultimately, the value of a writer lies in their ability to capture the essence of the human experience, weaving together thoughts, emotions, and events in a way that resonates with readers. No matter how sophisticated AI becomes, it will never be able to replace the ingenuity, empathy, and passion of a human writer.  
>  
>So, rather than fearing obsolescence, let's focus on the opportunities that AI presents, and strive to become better writers, marketers, and creatives in this ever-changing landscape. The future of writing is not a zero-sum game between humans and AI; it's a collaborative space where the two can complement each other and create something truly extraordinary.  
>  
>Keep writing, and never lose sight of the unique voice and creativity that make you an irreplaceable part of the literary world.

Not a bad response, but damn is it even wordier than I am. It repeated itself with fluff multiple times.
