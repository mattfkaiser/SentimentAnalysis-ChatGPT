No. Chat gpt cannot do advanced math beyond calc and linear algebra. It can only copy things that have previously been done and put on the internet. I've been able to find multiple questions that chat gpt gets wrong. If your job is more than a few steps of complexity, or there's a bunch of wrong answers on the internet, or not a lot of answers in general, chat gpt can't do it. Chat gpt cannot think critically and figure out industrial engineering based on a textbook on the internet.
