Funny how you  just described a comment instead of actually making an argument which considering the sub is kinda ridiculous. I’d love to hear about why you actually think massive companies using their essentially unlimited access to capital markets and buying any competitors or destroying them thru anti competitive practices is really actually good 

I mean you might not be a communist like me but I figured you’d at least agree with the overall sentiment that competition is a good thing without it companies just do nothing and become over bloated messes that can’t get anything done competition is what encourages innovation Id companies don’t have to worry about someone eating into their market share they won’t do anything like google has for a decade 

Im gonna use chatgpt here to do the hard part and turn my ideas and an earlier draft into a coherent passage . The view points and ideas are here I’m just lazy and alrdy spent too much time on this comment to give it up so here you go. 

So, let's take a closer look at IBM's history to illustrate my point. Back in the 80s, IBM was an over-bloated behemoth, with employees competing over trivial things like code length and the quality of their overhead projector slides. Their corporate structure, rife with bureaucracy and infighting among rival executives, hampered and sabotaged projects. This structure worked well enough when they focused on selling pricey mainframes to large institutions, but it became a problem when they inadvertently revolutionized the industry by inventing the modern PC.

IBM probably would have locked down their PC technology and sued anyone who tried to build something similar if it weren't for the looming threat of the FTC stepping in and breaking them up. This fear forced IBM to allow for competition in the PC market, leading to a flourishing and innovative industry.

One notable incident involved their CMOS chip. IBM believed that nobody could reverse-engineer it without violating their copyright. However, competitors not only reverse-engineered the chip but also created better versions of it. As a result, bootlegged systems and cheaper PCs entered the market, challenging IBM's dominance.

Despite their attempts to regain control by tightening restrictions and competing, IBM found itself outpaced by more agile competitors. They ended up releasing outdated and overpriced PCs, ultimately leaving the consumer electronics industry altogether.

The key takeaway here is that the FTC's commitment to preventing monopolistic behavior is what allowed the PC industry to thrive. If it hadn't been for the FTC keeping IBM in check, we might have been left with IBM as the sole major player in the PC market, stifling innovation and limiting technological advancements.


And just for transparency I [asked the gpt to summarize the interaction in their own words ](https://i.imgur.com/9IhhNHh.jpg)
