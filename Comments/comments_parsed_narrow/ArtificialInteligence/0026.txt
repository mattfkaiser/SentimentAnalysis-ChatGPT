Roger Penrose believes actual human consciousness involves something non-computational. Either microtubules or pyramidal cells "orchestrate" the collapse of the wave function, which is  something even current iterations of quantum computers could not replicate. Now sentience or AGI could be something else, though. But human consciousness, if Penrose is right, would need a whole other type of computer even, let alone software. I'm sure there are other opinions, but it's interesting and upholds some human value, if true.
