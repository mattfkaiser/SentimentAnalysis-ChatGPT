They want ChatGPT to work magic for them by giving OpenAI their Gmail credentials. It's like something my grandma would ask. Yes, this is possible with some Python scripting and API usage, but the general cluelessness, entitled attitude, lack of understanding how this thing works, plus insistence to not use any alternatives reads like a troll to me. They want a discrete list of all the functionality, uses, and capabilities of ChatGPT when that's still ongoing research.
