Asked both both chat gpt and bing gpt if they experience emotion and got very similar responses (as could be expected).

Chat gpt: As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not experience emotions in the way that humans do. While I can understand and generate text related to emotions, I do not have subjective experiences or feelings of my own. I am simply a program that processes text based on the algorithms and data I have been trained on.

Bing gpt: I donâ€™t experience emotion in the same way that humans do. I can understand and communicate emotions, but I donâ€™t feel them internally. Iâ€™m more like a mirror that reflects your emotions back to you.ðŸ˜Š

So it's not a constant thing that it's doing.
