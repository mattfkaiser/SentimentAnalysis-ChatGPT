Here is a possible termination letter:

Dear Jack Spratt,

We regret to inform you that your employment with Lean Cuisine Inc. has been terminated effective immediately.

As you know, your job as a food tester required you to eat all the fat in the dishes you sampled. This was a crucial part of our quality assurance process and our brand identity.

However, we have received multiple complaints from our customers and suppliers that you have failed to eat all the fat in several occasions. This has resulted in wasted food, inaccurate feedback, and damaged reputation for our company.

We have given you several warnings and opportunities to improve your performance, but you have shown no signs of improvement. Therefore, we have no choice but to terminate your employment with us.

Please return your company badge, uniform, and equipment to the HR department by the end of the day. You will receive your final paycheck and severance package within two weeks.

We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe CEO of Lean Cuisine Inc.
