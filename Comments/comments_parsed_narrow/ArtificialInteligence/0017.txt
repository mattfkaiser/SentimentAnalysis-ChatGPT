If you genuinely believe that present-day AI systems such as ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard are "conscious" in any meaningful sense, you're choosing to be intellectually obtuse. A crow may not be as intelligent as GPT, but it is likely more conscious.

I would recommend asking these chatbots to elaborate further on what constitutes consciousness from their perspective. Their explanations can be quite enlightening.

Given that the nature of "consciousness" is an ongoing enigma, we could arbitrarily assign any definition to the simplest of entities and claim they are conscious, which leads to a cyclical discussion. As it stands, Large Language Models (LLMs) do not meet the generally accepted criteria for consciousness.

> While Large Language Models like ChatGPT possess advanced capabilities, they lack the essential characteristics typically associated with consciousness. Consciousness is usually defined as the state of being aware and capable of thinking and perceiving one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings, possessing self-awareness, and having the capability to experience.

> However, LLMs:
> 1.  Do not have personal experiences: They can't feel emotions or pain, have desires, or experience the world in any tangible way.
> 2. Lack self-awareness: They don't possess a concept of "self" and don't hold personal beliefs or opinions.
> 3. Do not understand content: They generate responses based on patterns learned during training, not because they comprehend the underlying meanings.
> 4. Are not sentient: They lack the subjective perceptual experiences—known as qualia—that conscious beings possess.

> Therefore, while these models can mimic certain aspects of human conversation, it's crucial to remember that they are tools designed to assist with information and tasks, and not conscious entities.
