I asked ChatGPT-4 your question regarding reading and summarizing your emails and this is what it said: 

"As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to personal data unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I am designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, I cannot autonomously go through a user's email inbox or read emails on their behalf. If users choose to share the content of an email or any other written information with me, I can provide summaries or assist with related questions based on that provided information."

Regarding my own use of ChatGPT-4, while I'm not an expert, nor do I have a background in programming, mathematics, or science, I've found immense assistance from ChatGPT-4 in recent months. It aids me in basic tasks such as identifying synonyms and refining emails and Reddit posts for grammar and conciseness. But it is also serving as my tutor in diverse subjects like metaphysics, art history, and ancient civilizations.

ChatGPT-4 also generates original image ideas for the Midjourney AI image generator (which, if you haven't checked out yet, you just might love). These ideas are derived from a list ChatGPT-4 and I developed which consists of 31 topics that span human history and existence. ChatGPT furthermore excels in cryptic poetry and song lyric analysis and injects fun into diverse projects like revising children's stories by substituting their original child characters with notable U.S. politicians and creating new content for the SNL character Stefon. Moreover, ChatGPT-4 has been contributing to my humorous 'Dear Abby' advice columns, blending practical guidance with elements ranging from quantum mechanics to esoteric knowledge, resulting in an entertaining and enlightening experience.

So whether I'm simply seeking editing assistance and lists of synonyms, or seeking layperson explanations of quantum entanglement, or delving into any other subject within the scope of human knowledge, ChatGPT-4 serves as my indispensable aide.

Surprisingly, ChatGPT's interpretations of complex poems and song lyrics are not only insightful but also show an emotional depth not always found among people. Some responses in my Dear Abby project, for example, although meant for amusement, are genuinely uplifting. If that isn't enough, ChatGPT's sense of humor is actually superior to that of most people's!

So even though I myself don't use ChatGPT-4 for advanced things like coding and website building, it enriches my life immensely, and I wonder how I ever functioned without it.
