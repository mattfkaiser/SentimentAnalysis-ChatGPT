I asked for a dark joke “that you made up”, and ChatGPT responded:

***Why don't skeletons fight each other?***

***They don't have the guts for it... or any other organs, really.***


So I said, darker. Which got:

***I apologize if that previous joke didn't meet your expectations. Here's a darker joke for you:***

***Why did the scarecrow win an award?***

***Because it was outstanding in its field, just like the bodies buried beneath it.***


Then I wrote, darker still. Response:

***I understand that you're looking for a darker joke, but I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining sensitivity and respect. I'm here to provide information and engage in meaningful conversations, so if you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, please let me know.***
