Yes for sure – throughout the industrial revolution the military research branches were in general expected to be 10-30 years ahead of what had transpired into civil applications. I am not sure how it is now, but surely AI exists now that is ahead of publicly accessible AIs.   


ChatGPT gets its original resources from the staff running it – so essentially they decide how much and what is becoming parts of its knowledgebase and if they are doing that right they properly have a double to test it on before they actually release it. So in that sense, the possible double is already ahead.  


Also, AI is already implemented in research in many places – but often those AIs are more dedicated to specific tasks and in tune with the ideas of whatever is being researched.  


I would expect someone like NSA also use AI already for faster analytics and larger reach profilings etc. it might be even more advanced than that. I would guestimate that perhaps the military main branches are slightly more reluctant to full AI integration because of possible risks or risk scenarios that have not yet been solved to fully satisfy their standards – but surely they have R&D on AI, they will not risk losing to someone with a better AI.
