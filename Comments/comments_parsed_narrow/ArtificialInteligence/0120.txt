AI can help me construct things that I've already designed/outlined and save time by doing so. But it's research is poor and it's "ideas" are usually tired cliches, broken concepts, or a completely insane mess (useless).

My ability to google is much better than ChatGPT's ability to provide "research" as it can't tell the difference between fact and satire or fact and opinion or truth and dumb conspiracy theory. Because it is trained on the effectiveness of its userbase and the wisdom of its programmers, these web AIs are unlikely to improve by much because they are constantly learning from poor models.
