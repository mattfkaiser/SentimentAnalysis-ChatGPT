It is possible for colleges and universities to detect whether a student has used an AI chatbot like ChatGPT to complete their essay. There are several plagiarism detection software tools available, such as Turnitin, that can identify text that has been copied or generated by an AI system. These tools compare the submitted essay to a vast database of previously published content to identify any matches or similarities.

While it is possible for colleges to detect the use of AI chatbots, it is not a foolproof method. ChatGPT, as an AI language model, is designed to generate text that is unique and not easily detected as a copy-paste job. However, the use of AI in academic work is often considered unethical and could lead to severe consequences such as a failing grade, disciplinary action, or even expulsion from the institution.

It is important to follow your professor's instructions and complete the assignment using your own knowledge and skills. While AI tools like ChatGPT can be a helpful resource, they should not be used as a replacement for personal effort and critical thinking. If you are struggling with the assignment, consider seeking assistance from your professor or a tutor. They can provide guidance and support to help you successfully complete the assignment.
