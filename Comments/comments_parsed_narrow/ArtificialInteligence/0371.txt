I should probably rephrase the question, legally can you get in trouble for being accused of using an ai chat bot like chatGPT to write and essay for you, like sure a professor could accuse me of using a chat bot but it would just be an accusation and there wouldn’t be any real proof of it being an AI generated response right? Unless there is a legit AI detection software that  is trusted enough and could be used in the court of law to accuse you of cheating/plagiarism. But is there even an AI detection software that could be used to accuse you of plagiarism legally? I think it’s an interesting question to ask since all the AI stuff is still quite new and things are still being figured out

Side note: I’m honest to god not even using chatGPT to make this essay, the essay is pretty easy anyways, basically just talk about covid and fit it into 2 pages, nothing crazy or worth cheating for, the question just popped into my head and I just actually thought it was a good question to ask and discuss
