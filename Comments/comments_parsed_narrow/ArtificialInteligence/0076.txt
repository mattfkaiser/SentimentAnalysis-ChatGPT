What is it that you're concerned about, specifically? This seems like a tool that does the following:

* Takes in a general description of a vacation
* Produces an itinerary (so far all doable with ChatGPT circa months ago)
* Then takes that itinerary and looks up each stop in Google Maps to provide specific photos, details and booking info.

Am I missing something? It's not like the AI is being given control over Google Maps, here. There's just a dumb (no offense to OP) little script of the sort people were writing in 2000 to feed form data into a webpage.

The fact that that form data is coming from an AI is kind of irrelevant.
