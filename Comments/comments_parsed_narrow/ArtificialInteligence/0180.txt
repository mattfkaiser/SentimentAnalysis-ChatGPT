No one really knows. But learn to use it as an advanced info “calculator” to be more productive.

I’m a developer. I’ve been at it for more than 3 decades. I’m using chatgpt to create test data or review code, and copilot to learn new language s and frameworks. 

Use it to accelerate what you do. Command the AI, instead of fearing it. Lean into it. Get good at it.
