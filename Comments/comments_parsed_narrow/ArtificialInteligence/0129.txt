Unfortunately this is not really going to be possible. Because artificial intelligence and chat GPT will explain how it does the work, not just what the output is. It's not like a calculator that way.

What will likely happen in the long-term I predict is we will get rid of school probably past about eighth grade or so like what the Amish do. We will say that school is no longer needed past that point. Additionally, in the interim, we are likely going to move towards a world where most assignments are done in class and not at home and where computers will not be allowed and where books will not be allowed. 

Lectures will be delivered at home through things like GPT being used as a tutor. That definitely seems to be the way to go in the short term.
