I get yelled at all the time for saying it's just an incredibly sophisticated pattern recognition machine. But I'm with you, the innovation will be people that utilize this to enhance human productivity. So although I don't think ChatGPT is really "ground breaking" technology, the next level generation of pattern recognition in language can be leveraged to do some pretty crazy things. So to me this is just the stepping stone to the true innovation, but it was necessary that someone had to go through the process of breaking our language down to the point it could be useable by machines outside of just keyword matching.
