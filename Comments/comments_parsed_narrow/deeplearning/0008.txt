Maybe that's just a necessary step to cull those who cannot critically think and to force society to stop taking things for granted.

At the end of the day misinformation like this was already generated and shared even before ChatGPT was released, yet it seems that the governmental response was to allow domestic sources and try to hunt down foreign ones. So if the government doesn't care, why should you?

People generally don't seem to care even if the misinformation is human-generated, ex. Hunter Biden's laptop story. I wouldn't lose sleep over this either way, it is still human-operated.
