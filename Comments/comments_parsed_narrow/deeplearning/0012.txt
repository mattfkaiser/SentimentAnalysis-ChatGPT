I don't see this being any faster than just typing and clicking oneself. Perhaps if you were specifically only using voice input, but even then I struggle to see how this is anything more than a front-end for ChatGPT's capabilities.

Seeing as you mentioned you are giving it the HTML DOM to allow it "see" and interact with what you're seeing, it's not too different than using something like vimium's f-key action, which allows you to navigate to any link/clickable element.

I would try to market the potential voice interaction aspect more perhaps, my two cents
