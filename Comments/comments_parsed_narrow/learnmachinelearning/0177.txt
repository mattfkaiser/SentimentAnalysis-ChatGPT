Yes, you definitely need to be able to understand code well enough to edit it. But i was mighty nice to have the case whens written and only have to edit them :) as someone who did grad school in my 5th language, I definitely would have appreciated something like this to spit out the basic grammar and form and only need the actual content rewritten to it, the small things like that took me ages and contributed nothing to my actual skills + i would often have very original results dismissed due to poor or unnatural Japanese when presenting them. 

Also, remember that chatgpt keeps your data and that inputting your data into it does break NDAs, always use dummys.
