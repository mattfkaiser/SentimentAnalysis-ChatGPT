I think the future is unknown currently, but the direction IMO is definitely trending towards general content, having a much lower price point with the assist of AI tools.

I'm both a technical writer, have run an SEO oriented agency and have been playing around with chatGPT lately as well.

My general impression is that chat GPT is not a one click solution but, in the hands of someone who knows how to structure content and the general outline for the flow of an article, it is a improvement and productivity by several orders of magnitude.

Without a doubt it's going to put a lot of freelance writers out of business IMO. 

To counterbalance that however, specific to the SEO industry, I think the nature of search is going to change a lot as well. My advice to anyone who feels AI tools might encroach upon their bottom line is:  ready to pivot but with a mindset of ample opportunity.
