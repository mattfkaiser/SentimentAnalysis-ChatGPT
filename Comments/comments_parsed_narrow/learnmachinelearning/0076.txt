In my eyes it’s kinda bad, besides the astounding accomplishment from a dl point of view, it just sucks because every single thing you ask needs to be fact checked manually by using google…the only thing it’s currently capable of is telling you stuff with huge confidence but you just never know if it is bullshitting or not. I even know of people integrating chatgpt in business and to me it’s just complete insanity
