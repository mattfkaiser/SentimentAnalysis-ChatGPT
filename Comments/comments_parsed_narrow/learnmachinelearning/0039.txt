I’ve tried this with more advanced topics on a more extended timeline. It honestly cannot understand things like time or difficulty. The best way to use ChatGPT to learn is to use it for quizzing and a resource for conversation. You’re not going to get a great learning plan out of it for anything that doesn’t already have an easily accessible learning plan.
