Head of AI at a small tech company. Itâ€™s an amazing and very exciting achievement. Overall I am highly cautious about application of this technology - especially given its potential to hallucinate convincing fictitious information. There are many applications where the current embodiment of ChatGPT-like technologies introduces a very high risk profile with potential to cause significant harm. There is a lot of overhead in managing such risks and they create far greater liabilities.
