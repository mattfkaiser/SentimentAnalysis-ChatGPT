Tbh I thought seo articles have been dead for years. The induatry is a sweatshop employing kids and third world country citizens to master a topic in 5 minutes of google and churn out basic articles about lawn mowers without ever having seen a lawn in real life. 

Actually my first thought when I saw chatGPT used for articles was that it was written exactly like the shite I would write on vworker when I was in uni. 

If you're a good writer, I suggest you just respecialize.  Writing is a vast and varied field, you definitely can do better.
