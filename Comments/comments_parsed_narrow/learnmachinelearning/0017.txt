(Current software EGR in grad school studying AI and ML)
I relate more to madrury83. ChatGPT is an amazing step forward. It’s allowed people to take a closer look into what ML could do for language models. Very good work by team at OpenAI whom deserve all of the praise and attention that their work has gotten them…. But (and there is always a but) 

ChatGPT will not save or destroy the world. It’s a step forward towards something great and will probably inspire more non engineers to study the field of ML. More people of diverse applications will help introduce better technology to the public. 

To me, ChatGPT is now over-hyped and could walk into the over used category of ‘one-size-fits-all’ if the broader public does not learn to understand what it is and isn’t. It cannot make anything original since it learns from existing material or give a nuanced answer. I wish OpenAI created a watermark for AI generated material when they released the product from the start.
