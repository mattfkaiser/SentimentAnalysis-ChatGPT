I'm really bad at communicating what I believe in a nice way.. so sorry upfront.  
AI is a political subject, a serious one! But of course, that would depend on your definition of what "political" means. For me, anything that distributes information to 100 million users on a daily basis has the power to incrementally and slowly introduce information into any system and, with time and some external help, shape the consensus toward any subject. If you studied computer science and you got any closer to information and system theory, you know what I'm talking about.  
I also want to challenge the idea of a biology student being somehow not adequate to criticize artificial intelligence. In my own experience, some of the most powerful insights come from the intersection of different ways of explaining processes. I mean, think about how in a certain way LLMs understand everything as a language, how language becomes the code (coding) for everything. Biology is just another way of explaining things; the principles and logic are very valid, and your friend can have an understanding from a sensibility that you did not train yet.  
Also, saying that you can't tell a model what to say is just wrong. You can absolutely, completely, and without a doubt decide what, how, and when certain information is given or not given. From not subtle at all strategies like "safeguards" that literally spell out a predetermined answer, denying access to information inside the model, to subtle fine-tuning that would circumscribe you to certain "clusters" of data. I mean, you literally need to adjust a parameter called "bias" so you can modify the output from the model. That is how models like midjurney can now represent hands more accurately. How can you tell what other fine-tuning has been made?  
How can you know what the aggregation of billions of interactions with the model looks like each day? What ideas are being included and excluded? Did you ever ask ChatGPT about a subject that you really know about and get disappointed by how what you think is the most relevant author in that field was not included? Or a concept that was incomplete or plain wrong?  
You can't tell because you don't have access to the entire picture, but companies can strategize on all the information they collect from these interactions and from all the associated marketing data that is collected from the entire ecosystem of products they own and from all the others they pay to get the information.  
Companies will and for sure are "pushing their agenda," which only means, doing business.  
I have some videos that may be interesting if you want to spend the time...
