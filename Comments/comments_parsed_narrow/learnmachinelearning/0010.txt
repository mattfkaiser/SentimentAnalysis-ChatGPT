As with other things, ChatGPT and other generative machine learning models are tools. Tools with specified purposes given what they were trained for. 

You wouldn’t use a shovel to drive a nail into drywall, and you wouldn’t use ChatGPT to predict the stock market. 

ChatGPT, because of how realistic it’s outputs seem, is just the latest fad. But it’s not a one stop solution to every business problem. 

My biggest gripe right now is not with ChatGPT or OpenAI - its with the charlatans on LinkedIn and the like who are scamming people with schemes related to using it
