>I really doubt so. 

The answer to OP's question as asked, is NO. It is not available to train.  GPT and other models are available.

If you KNOW you are only guessing, why comment in this manner? Or why start off with a negative?

>chatGPT is of 175 billion of parameters. Anything with that size already requires specially built architecture no individual could afford.

That wasn't the question OP is asking and is not relevant to the answer. OP seems to have a firmer grasp than you do. OP just did not know if ChatGPT was *also* available.

>not in the sense of retraining the model.

OP did not say retraining. No one says retraining.  Use proper terms if you are going to pretend to know what you are talking about.

GPT can be trained, the extra data stays in the cloud.  There are 1000's of companies and individuals training it and that have trained it, that is why you see so many websites (if looking) that have "AI" based tools.  Resume builders, PowerPoint builders etc..

There are three (probably more) ways to interact with GPT models other than just going to the wesbite

1. You act as a middle man, just sending prompts via API http
2. You prepare/prepend prompts specifically tailored to the desired output and complete with 1.
3. You train your own data to facilitate a wider and specific range of output and complete with 1, 2 and your key.

ChatGPT is a front facing product, it is not GPT4.  I would not know, but if I had to guess I would say ChatGPT will never be anything other than 1 and 2 with no ability to train.
