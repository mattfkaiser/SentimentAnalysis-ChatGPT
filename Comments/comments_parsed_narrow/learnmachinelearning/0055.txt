Ok, my story. Have over 150,000 CovId links, (Subreddit’s) have been updating the list every 5 mins, 24/7. For 3 years now. The B2B is to make this available to healthcare interested folks. 

Some great tips here. Looks like diving into the ChatGPT api is the place to be. The data is super clean, saved in a PostgreSQL database. The majority of the links are summary titles from journal articles. 

Business card I guess should say “Model Maker.”

More to play with. :-)
