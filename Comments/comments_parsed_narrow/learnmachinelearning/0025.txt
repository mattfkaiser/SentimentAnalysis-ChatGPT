Late answer but an answer:  


You are arguing with me over a non-argument. You literally don't know what he said. He had no clue what AI even was, he didn't even know the term bias, weights or anything. He simply watched a shitty conspiracy YouTube video. That's everything. That's honestly all you can read out of my comment...  


I know that biology students can criticize AI. Everyone can. The knowledge is not only available to computer scientists.

But there's a fine difference between manipulating inputs, feeding in false information and straight up saying "Yea OpenAI sits there and tells ChatGPT to say THIS exact thing at THIS exact time". That's not how AI works.

I honestly won't watch any of these videos, because I already watched enough about this topic. I know how bias works, because as I said: I'm literally working on AI!  


Just because the point of someone COULD be right it doesn't make their opinion valid if it's based on bs. Take this as an example:  


If someone says "Man today is so fucking hot, we need to fight climate change" ( I know this is a casual saying which doesn't need to be analyzed, but take this in the context of a political debate) he is basically right about the climate change part. But "that the day is hot" part isn't necessarily a consequence of it. Sometimes it's just weather. Climate is something entirely different with influence on weather. The conclusion is right, however the rest doesn't need to be true. Just because something CAN happen it doesn't mean that shitty conspiracies are true now.

If you have any doubt that he was simply talking bullshit: He later said that we are able to open a wormhole for space travel. When I asked him to explain how a wormhole works he didn't have an answer. After I explained it to him he agreed to disagree. About a scientific fact...

You are right now defending a shit talker.
