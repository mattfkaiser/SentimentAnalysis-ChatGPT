I have a feeling that ChatGPT was a chatbot that was a trailer to what was really possible. GPT4 could actually become useful. But I am getting the feeling that Google’s (actually Deepmind’s) answer with Sparrow will actually be the first AI assistant. I have come to this conclusion by inferring what the assistant is capable of from the 23 rules that they set in place for it. Very exciting stuff!
