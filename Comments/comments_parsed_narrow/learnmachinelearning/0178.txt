Heh, i won't lie I used chatgpt for code at work the other day, and also for an application gobbledegock that is easy but would've taken me my previous free time to write. I definitely think this will change the game when it comes to wasting time on the small things. 

As for homework... let's be honest, kids and students have always found ways to cheat the system and they always will. For every place that checks things thoroughly there are dozens of schools and even universities that don't.  If anything, it equalized the game for the kids who can't afford to pay someone else to write it, which honestly, i don't mind. The elite has always cheated, and always will. I do feel sorry for the kids who won't be able to make money writing their rich colleague's essays for them, but in my experience even a good chatgpt prompt is more work than they'd be willing to do...
