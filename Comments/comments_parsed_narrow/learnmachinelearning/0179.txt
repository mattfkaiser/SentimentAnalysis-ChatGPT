I agree with the sentiment that the internet will soon be filled with chat gpt related content. I had it write a one star review with a remark about the manager and it did it remarkably well. As soon as people can start churning out millions of reviews, articles, comments or whatever with the click of the button that are as convincing as chatgpt I feel it will make it even harder to rely on anything
