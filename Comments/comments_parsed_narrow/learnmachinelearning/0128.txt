My understanding is that, while chatGPT was built using mostly unsupervised learning on enormous/messy datasets which can be trained with massive compute power (no prob for large players/problem for open source), instructGPT approach depends heavily on supervised learning/manually labeled data sets, which requires a lot of manpower and time (no prob for open source/prob for big players). So, it's only low hanging fruit for a volunteer/open source mass movement.
