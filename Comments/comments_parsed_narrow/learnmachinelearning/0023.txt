Agreed... Had a discussion with someone about ChatGPT lately. He probably watched 2-3 clickbait videos and told me that OpenAI directly influences what the AI says for their agenda. When I tried to explain to him how GPT actually works and that AI is way more complicated than saying: "I want you to say this, so you'll do", he blocked it off and said "we can agree to disagree".  


He is literally a biology student and I'm a computer scientist working with AI. While I'm not all knowing and still far from an expert, what he said was just straight bs. Sometimes I get the feeling that AI is becoming a political opinion.
