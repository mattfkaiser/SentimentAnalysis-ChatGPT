I'm not an ML engineer (yet) but I've been through a few hype cycles i.e. Dot com boom and Crypto etc.

As a software engineer if there's one thing I've learned it's "The trend is your friend".  


If you jumped on the Dot com or crypto wave you increased your probability of getting a higher salary. Regardless of whether you thought the technology would succeed or not.

It's still a bit of a gamble, I skipped the Metaverse hype wave. Too many red flags.

In the case of ChatGPT I predict we will see a lot of corporates who want to prototype a ChatGPT experience on their internal data. Think user manuals in manufacturing etc.

So at the moment I'm teaching myself to fine tune LLaMa on PDF's using Rust, because to be honest it's fun.
