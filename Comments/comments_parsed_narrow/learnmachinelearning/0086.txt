hmmm, I tried it, not what I was expecting, I have my settings to code-davinci-002 in both playground and your extension:

in playground I get:

```
"""
a function to compare the simularity of 1000 words using spacy
"""

import spacy
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')

def simularity(word1, word2):
    """
    a function to compaire the simularity of two words using spacy
    """
    return nlp(word1).similarity(nlp(word2))

def simularity_matrix(words):
    """
    a function to compaire the simularity of 1000 words using spacy
    """
    simularity_matrix = np.zeros((len(words), len(words)))
    for i in range(len(words)):
        for j in range(len(words)):
            simularity_matrix[i, j] = simularity(words[i], words[j])
    return simularity_matrix

def plot_simularity_matrix(simularity_matrix, words):
    """
    a function to plot the simularity matrix
    """
    df = pd.DataFrame(simularity_matrix, index=words, columns=words)
    plt.figure(figsize=(20, 20))
    sns.heatmap(df

```

in your extension with the same prompt I get:

\`The function is used to compare the similarity of 1000 words using spacy.\`

Haven't tried chatgpt seems like the usage is very high right now.
