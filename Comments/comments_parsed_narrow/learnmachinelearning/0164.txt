ChatGPT explained with words:
ChatGPT is a website powered by the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model  
GPT is a machine learning model trained to generate content  
The model works by encoding input sentences into smaller pieces and giving each word a mathematical value   
It uses self-attention to determine the context and importance of each word in the sentence  
It then predicts the best sequence of words to use as a response  
GPT was trained on billions of questions and answers from the internet and has also been exposed to multiple choice questions to help it learn strategies for finding the correct answer  
It is used on the chatGPT website to generate responses to user input.
