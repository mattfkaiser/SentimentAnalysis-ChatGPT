Right. I think ChatGPT in its current state is really only a tool for content making (ideas and then deep diving into those ideas). I’m not sure if in the next 10 years chatbots are really going to mimic humans and even capture your voice. The true experts on specific niches will know what they’re talking about and they can just tweak their content so that they can have something original and call it their own.
