don't ask me where I get this from

OpenAI's ChatGPT is a large language model that has been trained to process and generate human-like text. It uses a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which involves training a neural network on a large dataset of text.The neural network consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, which process and analyze the input data. As the neural network processes the input data, it learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and uses this knowledge to generate responses that are similar to human-like text.The ChatGPT model is able to "understand" things to a certain extent because it has been trained on a large dataset of text, which includes a wide range of topics and styles of language. This allows the model to generate responses that are relevant to the input text and that use appropriate language and style.However, it is important to note that the ChatGPT model does not have a true understanding of the meaning of the input text or the responses that it generates. It is simply a machine learning model that has been trained to process and generate text based on the patterns and relationships it has learned from its training data. It does not have the ability to think or have true understanding in the same way that a human does.
