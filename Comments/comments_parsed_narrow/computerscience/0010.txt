That also true, but the majority of the adult population also aren’t engineers. Your calculator example is useful, though: there are some calculators in the world (TI-83 all the way up to things like Mathematica/Matlab/R) that do things so advanced, the average person doesn’t even know how to use the tool. But those who do – those who have specialized in the field – can use it to great effect making discoveries, digesting troves of data, or, well frankly things I don’t have the expertise to even know!

So it is with ChatGPT and similar systems (LLMs). They hold promise to be fantastic tools (someday) for a variety of fields – including software engineering – but every sufficiently sophisticated tool needs a sufficiently specialized human to provide the right inputs and drive the human/tool interaction in a useful direction. Otherwise, you’re just going to get garbage in, garbage out :-)

Don’t worry, be excited! I’m probably too old/entrenched at this point to think of the cool things that can be done with these new tools (I’ll stick to my TI-83, thank you), but you have an opportunity to innovate. Don’t be afraid of it!

Besides, if it ends up you should be afraid of it, let it never be said that I didn’t welcome our robot overlords.
