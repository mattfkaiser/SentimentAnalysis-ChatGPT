I still fail to see how the method of generation matters. I know that everything 'loses' its artificial intelligence status as soon as computers can do it, but what ChatGPT does would have been straight up magic 10 years ago. It clearly displays intelligent behavior, it can give me better answers and explain many topics better than you can. What if it becomes a better conversationalist than you two iterations down the line? It would then actually be more reasonable to deny that you are intelligent than to say that this network isn't. At any rate, the difference in ability would have to be acknowledged. All that matters is the quality of the output.
