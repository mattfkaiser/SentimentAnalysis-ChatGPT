I think programming skills will always be useful even if not full blown programmer.

1) It teaches problem solving.

2) while chat gpt can do somethings....it can't do everything. Plus where do you think it is learning to program?
3) Chat gpt is pulling stuff from the internet and we all know everything on the internet is 100% true. 
4) Programming is more than just slinging code. It is getting to really know what the customer is trying to do and anticipate their needs. 
5) It will be years before companies even remotely rely on AI exclusively for coding. There are a lot of unknowns and changes to original processes that require dev and test. 
6) People were freaking out when the 1st low code/no code plat forms came out. There is still a shortage of qualified programmers. So much so a lot of tech firms have dropped degree requirements to be a programmer.

If you love it, stick with it and you can be successful.
