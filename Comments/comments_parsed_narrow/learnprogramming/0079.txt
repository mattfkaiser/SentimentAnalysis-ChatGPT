What in the hell are you talking about man?

You’re more than entitled to your opinion but I don’t think you are being objective at all about the leap forward in generative AI being impressive from a technological standpoint.

I don’t see how anybody who is a programmer can look at what was available before chatGPT came out up to the release GPT-4 and not see see the insane change in the capabilities and accuracy of Large Language Models.

Out of curiosity; what makes you think these models are not impressive?
