Yeah, it's like Coursera can't predict where my personal stumbling block is, so it just has to assume where to get more detailed. Whereas with chatgpt, I can breeze through what is crystal clear (to me) and spend way more time learning the big hurdles I struggle with (and have struggled with for years honestly!). Good breakthroughs.
