I don't know, but I did try to have it solve a relatively simple logic bug in unity and it failed, which makes me think it's not a great tool for bugfixing. Someone who was new to Unity asked this question, and after I helped them troubleshoot it I thought it might be interesting to see if the bot could figure it out. 

The user had set up a simple looping 2D patrol for a character, running in update. If they used Vector2.lerp it stopped at the first patrol point, if it used vector3.lerp it disappeared from the camera during when approaching the second point but continued the loop. It was simple enough, Unity2d still has Z levels and a 3D environment, it just uses an orthographic camera and different collision logic to negate that (usually), the guy had put the 2nd patrol point at a z level behind the camera's clipping plane, so it disappeared when navigating the z level and when constrained to vector2 it was never able to match the position of the 2nd point. When I posed the question to ChatGPT, it simply assumed that since transform.position != patrolPoint[i].transform.position right now, it never moves to the next part of the patrol, as if it was a simple While loop, and ignored the fact that update is...updated.
