Thank you for saying this. I'm currently in school taking Java SW classes and my instructor is not helpful at all and I cannot get support from the school.

So I'm basically paying to read a book read a paper of requirements with no tutorials and no help..... Why am I paying for this if I don't have access to the resource I'm paying for?....The instructor.

I have used chatGPT it's been helpful but it can't do everything which is ok. But I am learning from it.
