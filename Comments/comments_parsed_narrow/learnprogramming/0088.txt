Your professor sounds like an ass. It’s so easy these days to record lectures, and so helpful, why wouldn’t you? I’m convinced that the only reason professors do this is out of spite for students that don’t give them the perceived respect that they believe they deserve by immortalizing every word they speak in class.

That said, there is a good reason that college courses tend to focus on teaching “how to learn” as opposed to concrete information, and that is that the languages, hardware, and libraries that we use to create software and digital content are constantly changing. If the sole purpose of your class was to teach you Java, that knowledge would only serve you so long until the language has undergone changes and you need to go relearn it, or until some other language wins over popularity. The skills that really make you into a tech person are less about specific knowledge and more about general understanding of the structures and logic that make computers work, and the ability to be continuously teaching yourself new technologies and adapting to new workflows. If that doesn’t sound like an enjoyable existence, maybe IT/CS is not for you.

And for those saying using ChatGPT is lazy, it’s absolutely not. It’s just as valid a source of information as Wikipedia. Just treat it’s responses with the same level of scrutiny that you would a Wikipedia article.
