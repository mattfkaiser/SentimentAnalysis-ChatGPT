I can't speak for everyone, but my first program was 95% code I copied and pasted from Stack Overflow with little to no understanding of what it did or how it worked. As time went on, and I spent more time with the code, making modifications and debugging it, I learned how it worked. I've been working as a software engineer and I still use stack overflow occasionally. I've added Chat GPT to my list of resources, which has genuinely increased my productivity. I see using Chat GPT as more or less the same as using a resource like Stack Overflow. You aren't a fraud, you are learning. Keep it up! Don't blindly copy, try to understand what you are taking from these resources, but don't let that stop you from moving ahead!
