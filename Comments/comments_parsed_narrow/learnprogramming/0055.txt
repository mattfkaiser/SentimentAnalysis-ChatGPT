You can use their API for that. Tons of people are doing similar stuff.

The challenge is basically that ChatGPT can't digest the "whole" thing. So what a typical solution looks like is this:

1. User enters query
2. Search the website for some of the most relevant results (or look them up in your own database)
3. Feed those results to ChatGPT followed by the user's query, and have it output the results

If you want to try it out, OpenAI has a playground where you can see what's possible with their API.
