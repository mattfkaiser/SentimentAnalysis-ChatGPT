I've teached in schools for many years prior to learn programming, and helped a lot of my friends trying to learn their own things.

You are right. You will spend a lot of time correcting and even "teaching" AIs... But that's a good way to verify your studies!

Thinking about it: AIs don't get tired of talking with you. People will get annoyed or tired after some time. ChatGPT won't. And it won't judge you if you struggle to understand something, as it is a machine with unlimited patience. It is an amazing learning tool up to intermediate level.
