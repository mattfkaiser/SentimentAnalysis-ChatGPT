I haven't used chatgpt extensively but have put some hours into it. I think it's been handcuffed and retarded down in the past few weeks / months. It's not the same as it was closer to first release.

That's not a whole answer to everything you're seeing but I think think the public AI's we have are just not the same as the really good / really smart AI's.

Tbh Im not informed enough to know the difference. Are the best AI's more custom? Do they share source code only? Are they built all from the same API? Wish I knew because eventually I want to get into machine learning but I'm not advanced enough yet so I don't go into the deep waters
