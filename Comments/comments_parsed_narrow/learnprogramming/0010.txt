If you need to learn what something is immediately, it's good to use, it basically Google's for you and saves time. Just do not let it code for you.
I was sceptical at first, because I came from the art world/artstation when all these AI models started forming into the mainstream and it was awfully scary. It sucks when you have to wonder if your future is going to be your future in the future.
I transitioned to learning to code and work towards a career with it.
And to come full circle, I tried chat GPT and I was honestly surprised at how intelligent it could be. It's a useful tool and as long as you use it responsibly, I don't see any issue with you using it. Just be aware that some companies may or may not allow it when you get a job. It's still a new technology so I doubt there's anything in place yet.
