Very cool. So you use it to write code for you instead of you figuring out the code? Not trying to be an ass.. I am an older dude who has slowed down quite a bit and while I love to code.. I can't keep up with the younger 20 somethings today that were born/raised/trained with all these new modern ways/languages/etc. So I tend to think of ChatGPT as a newer/better SO/Reddit/Google search.. like a pair programmer that I can interact with.. but so far I've just blindly assumed I say "Write me a function in JS that can do this with that and uses this library.". And it does something.. usually not very good. Another response here is to create a custom chat interaction and keep refining it.. not entirely sure how to do that yet.. but I did read in a few articles about how this sort of AI could very well easily replace junior developers.. but require a person to know how to interact with it.. say the write things.. to finesse it if you will to generate the code you want. That is what I need to learn I guess.
