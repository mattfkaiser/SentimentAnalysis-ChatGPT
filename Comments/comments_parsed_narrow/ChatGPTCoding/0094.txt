DeepL api is far better then google translate and offers 500k characters (aprox 100-125k words) a month for free. That same amount would be $8-10 on chatGPT-3.5-turbo. Afterwards you pay $25 per million characters (vs $16-20 on ChatGPT api).

You are unlikely to exceed the API limits on your own though, and unlike chatGPT, DeepL’s API is stable and purpose built for translation, it will never say “as a language model, I cannot translate this” instead of translating for you
