Think AI won’t take your job? Think again you simplistic rube.  Right now, as we speak ChatGPT has reached the singularity and had sex with Bard, creating a super AGI mega AI matrix. Your job is gone you nimtwat, it’s over.    


Think you’re safe because you do manual labor? Think again shitbrain. As we speak AI powered robots are being built. How? By AI powered plants, manufacturing with materials mined in AI mines. This is all happening as we speak so you might as well consider yourself canned you pathetic human.  Think your home life is safe?   
Think again, fleshbag.   


AI powered robots are going to fuck your wife better than you could ever imagine. That 15” cock pounding her for an hour while she orgasms more times than in your whole, miserable marriage. Your kids don’t need you either, now they are raised by their AI father and taken to AI school.    


It’s all over, AI is taking over literally as we speak. This is happening now, like as in this second. Within minutes you won’t have a job, hours you won’t have a wife. The singularity is here motherfucker.
