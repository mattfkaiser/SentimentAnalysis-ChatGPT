Do you have a recommendation for a service for writers? I have a lot of books I've written that I want to reference quickly with Chatgpt without having to do any coding. It's a pain in the butt looking for a bunch of instances of a character doing something over multiple books. I just wanna ask a chatbot to pull them up for me in a sequence or something.
