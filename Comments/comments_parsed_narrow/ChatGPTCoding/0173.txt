This is the power of chat GPT, not a weakness. The problem is misunderstanding it's uses and expecting it to behave in ways it wasn't intended to be used. We have been able to make simple and incredibly accurate database queries for decades and have many tools to get this done. We have not really had technology yet that can fabricate data so well and this is where the power lies. Instead of complaining that it's not doing what you want it to do, find ways to use it for it's strengths.
