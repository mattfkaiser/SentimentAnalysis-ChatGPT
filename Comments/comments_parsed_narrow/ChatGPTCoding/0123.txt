Hey!  I hear you.  I'm 50.  I'm using it to help me write python mostly and some react UI stuff.  I hadn't know python before but knew react a bit. (I am a professional developer though, just fyi so you know my perspective. I use c# and write business apps)

I'm using it exactly as you described.  I interact and iterate with it a lot.  I'll ask for code that does x, y, z and it'll give me a first cut.  I'll run that and get an error.  I might see the error right away or I might ask it about the error.  Often I just copy paste the error message as the next prompt and it'll say "oh, I'm sorry, I should've done this" or "oh, try this instead".

You need to have some skill and knowledge so you can tell when it gets stuck or things wrong.  But it gets lots of things right and it is writing a large percentage of the code. 

So, there is a certain amount of me not learning as much or as deeply as I would if I spent the time doing it all myself.  But my goal is two fold:  1) to learn about python and react, but also 2) to play with the AI and learn about it. (And I don't actually care about react that much - I just need a UI)

So I'm happy with the trade off.  I feel like while I'm not learning as deeply of the python and react at this moment, I am getting 10 hours of work done in 1 hour and am learning much more about the AI side of things than I would if I spent all that time on the python and react.

I've used it to help me write a UI replacement for the chatGPT website. It uses the API.  Here's the [Github](https://github.com/bortlip/chat-buddy) if you're interested.  That's probably 50 to 75% GPT python code and 80 to 95% GPT react code.
