Not high quality maintainable code, no. Chatgpt cannot architect the code in a way that would make it manageable because it cannot analyze your entire codebase. But I suspect this will change quickly. I think within a year or so there will be tools especially for coders that will make writing more sophisticated programs much more doable. For now, the best you can do is ask it questions and it can speed up the learning process for how to code. It can produce a few dozen lines of code at a time for you to perform a specific task, but good luck piecing it together into a larger, coherent program without a fair amount of experience.
