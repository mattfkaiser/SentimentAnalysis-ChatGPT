"Code" is one of those words that's always singular when talking about programming languages. It's one of those odd accidents of English that we don't use "codes" to refer to a large source code snippet or code block.  For a massive amount of code, a better term would be "large source code file" or "extensive amount of code".  Typically the word "codes" is used for other areas such as tax codes, in cryptography, or billing codes.  Just trying to help :)

In terms of ChatGPT, I've found it's better to work with smaller bits of code at once and not have it generate everything all together.  For example, go function by function.  But like others have said, you can also type "continue" to have it resume outputting.  GPT-4 is of course better than the free version of ChatGPT, and that's true about coding as well.  Personally, I would either use premium ChatGPT or another site tied into GPT-4 like phind.
