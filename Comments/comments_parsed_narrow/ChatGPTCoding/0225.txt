One thing that isn’t obvious is that I tell ChatGPT that my input/output is in json format since it’s not simply a text-in, text-out scenario. I collect useful facts from the game in text form until a time threshold is met and then send it. However, I also send a list of previous summaries with it that I ask ChatGPT to generate beside its text that is to be spoken. That means it has some memory of the overall game progress that it itself forms the input for.
