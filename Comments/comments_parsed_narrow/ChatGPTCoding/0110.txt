Watch a few videos on webscraping and xpath, selenium. Grab all the href links in the for loop grab all the <p> with .text and add them to a .csv file, check if the next page button exists if it does press it and loop again over all the links. To be honest you don't need to paste all the html code into chatgpt, you only need to learn xpath and what it means and what it does afterwards its very easy to get information from a website page. To find an element by xpath in selenium as of 2023 you will have to use driver.find\_elements("xpath", \[xpath path\]). If you still can't manage to scrape the website I would advise you to yet again look at youtube videos (sort them by new) and eventually when you understand the basic logical principals of a website, you won't have to come here and ask questions like these.
