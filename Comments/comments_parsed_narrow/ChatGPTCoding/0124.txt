The "image on a napkin" thing is not using ChatGPT. But direct access to GPT-4, the underlying system that ChatGPT uses to work. ChatGPT is just a demo showing one possible application that can be made with GPT-4, the "real" product is GPT-4. ChatGPT does not have image functionality yet, but GPT-4 can do it as a whole. That said, you should be able to get coding help from ChatGPT just fine, just say "We are programming X in Y language with Z stipulations, please write a code example for that."
