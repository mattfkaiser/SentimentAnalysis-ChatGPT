I built a program which auto switches between ChatGPT and Bing AI. The program has the following features:

-	Automatic switching between ChatGPT and Bing depending on request.
-	Multitask mode to execute as many tasks as required with access to information acquired from a prior task.
-	Multi-step Python code generation and creation of .py file as output'.
-	Execute and debug option for Python code. Supports automatic installation of missing modules.
-	Multi-step HTML code generation and creation of .html file as output'.
-	Generation of images utilising ChatGPT and DALLâ€¢E API.
-	Options for switching between gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4.
-	Text to speech support with AWS Polly (Neural Engine).
-	Pre-built ChatGPT roles.
-	Searching and scraping articles on Wikipeadia and google.
