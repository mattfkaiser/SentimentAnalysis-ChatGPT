I can see arguments on both sides...

On the one hand, there's this [excellent CGP Grey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) that points out that automation has been replacing humans in lots of jobs for a long time. It's easy to pick out the job of "assembly line worker" that no longer exists, but harder to spot the job of "paralegal" that now has fewer openings because with technology a smaller number of workers can do the job of many.

On the other hand, Sam Altman makes a great argument in [his interview with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw) (as I recall) that AI just lets you go to a developer meeting and say "Any crazy feature you always thought we'd never get to -- just put it on the table now". That is, as a developer AI doesn't replace me -- it just allows me to do a lot more, and maybe there's room for doing a lot more without requiring fewer workers.

I'll add to that a realization I came to recently... If you go to Midjourney and type "woman downtown" as a prompt, you're not going to get [this image](https://imgur.com/a/fhABJIn) (from Two Minute Papers' [recent video on Midjourney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKgWGmsBLY)). That's not because of some limitation in Midjourney (which is now spectacular), but because the space of possible images of a woman downtown is much bigger than the space of two-word prompts. Instead, to get that image the artist no doubt had to fine-tune a prompt. If you're looking for any old (awesome) image of a woman downtown, or if you can describe in detail what you're looking for interactively or otherwise, then Midjourney has you covered with no artist needed. More and more, though, I believe there'll always be a job for artists, because they navigate the large space of possible art in their own way. Any AI will do the same, of course, but my argument is that there may be so many ways of interpreting "woman downtown" that there's room for human and AI artists both.

I believe the same for programmers. If you were hoping that you'd have a job turning "I need a program to interpolate GPS tracks given a time that lies along the track" into a program (something ChatGPT did for me yesterday), you're in for a disappointment. If you work in the space of taking vague requirements and turning them into an awesome product, though, I think there'll be room for you for a long time yet -- not because AI can't do that, but because the space of possible products is so big that there may always be people who like how \*you\* navigate it.
