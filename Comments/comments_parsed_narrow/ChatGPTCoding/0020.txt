We developed a new chatbot with ChatGPT that will replace our dumb old one. Then we had a proof of concept for a new slogan generator that can generate a slogan according to our company style for ads. So you could drop a marketing partner maybe. And many other projects have started here and there. We are a health insurance company with a decent it department. 600 employees, about 80 in it and ~20 of them in development. And of course, we use it for development to answer questions, generate regex or just templating small web components.
