Your privacy concerns are totally valid and no one should trust their sensitive data with ChatGPT especially given their terms of service. That is also why we are developing a privacy-first ChatGPT variant based on open source models, that can be hosted fully on-premises or in a EU-hosted and EU-owned private cloud. You can take a look at [Mirage Studio Private ChatGPT](https://mirage-studio.io/private_chatgpt) variant for more information about our offering. Feel free to contact me!
