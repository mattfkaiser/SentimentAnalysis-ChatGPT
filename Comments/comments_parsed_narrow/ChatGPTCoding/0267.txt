That was an interesting read. I find it easier to start off with the backend first, and then work towards the frontend. 

I've also experienced the same where if I'm using it for a long period of time, it starts forgetting. As soon as this happens, I open up a new thread.

It definitely gets more difficult the bigger the project gets. I agree, having some coding knowledge has helped. There has been times where Chat GPT has not been able to correct itself. If I had not had some experience, I probably would not have found out the cause of the error or known how to direct it to fix the error.   


No complaints though, it's been really great so far. Here's hoping the plugin will make this experience more awesome.
