It's a short-lived trend. The bigger software companies are all working on things that will take all this to the next level.  Right now the only people who've had the time needed to do anything with ChatGPT on a commercial basis are basement-hackers... AND they are benefiting from the idea that ChatGPT isn't widely known yet... 

So if I create an app that can analyze legal contracts, and show it to a lawyer who's never seen or heard of ChatGPT, his mind will be blown. The developer of that app will think he's getting traction and positive feedback. When in reality, his entire business model is banking on the idea that his customer base remains ignorant.
