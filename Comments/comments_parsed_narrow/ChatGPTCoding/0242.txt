Yes, I've made this - basically replicated how ChatGPT handles the manifest files for the plugins and then performs the queries to the various api endpoints.

So as long as you know the domain where the files are, you could interact with any plugin.

In time I'll release it as part of the WordPress plugin (that just got approved for the plugin directory) I made, which turns your WordPress / Woocommerce site into a ChatGPT plugin.
