Im mainly referring to a scenario where ChatGPT were to give me an example code , and where the example came from (for example) Samsung.

Samsung staff leaked proprietary code to ChatGPT, enabling it to pass along the code.
Even if its generative AI code, it could solve a specific problem which in turn could be patent pending (but not yet disclosed)
