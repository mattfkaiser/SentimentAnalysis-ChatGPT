I am in the same boat as the OP. But I am thinking coding will get “easier” with ChatGPT over time, but never get completely technical-free. (The same way writing get easier with it, but base knowledge is still needed to keep things coherent.)

With that, I am motivated to learn. Is python the right language to start learning? What IDE do you recommend? I was directed to PyCharm by ChatGPT.
