In my eyes itâ€™s kinda bad, besides the astounding accomplishment from a dl point of view, it just sucks because every single thing you ask needs to be fact checked manually by using googleâ€¦the only thing itâ€™s currently capable of is telling you stuff with huge confidence but you just never know if it is bullshitting or not. I even know of people integrating chatgpt in business and to me itâ€™s just complete insanity
