ChatGPT is lame the vast majority of time it fails to delivers precise figures, is outputting loads of *lieux communs* and can't discern what's pertinent or dataset bias. 
In short it can't make a single decision or arbitrage.

Shutting down what already has been released is pointless.

Sam Altman concern only is "plausible deniability" as he very well can switch the dataset to limit CHATGPT to a narrow knowledge field.

He doesn't want to take responsibility for replacing millions of telemarketers and call centers by an AI. Meanwhile he still do funding rounds and push the thing further.

Crocodile tears.
