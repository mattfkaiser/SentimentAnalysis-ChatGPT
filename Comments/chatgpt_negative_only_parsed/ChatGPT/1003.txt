ChatGPT 4.0 does seem to get the Russian idiom someone mentioned correct. It also improves the German translation.

Finally, someone said that in Spanish we say "it's mandarin to me". While I've heard that, it's definitely a regional thing, where I am from we only say "This is in chinese!" (esto estÃ¡ en chino!).

    Spanish: "Todo me suena a chino."
    French: "C'est du chinois pour moi."
    German: "Das ist fÃ¼r mich bÃ¶hmische DÃ¶rfer."
    Russian: "Ð­Ñ‚Ð¾ Ð´Ð»Ñ Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ñ ÐºÐ¸Ñ‚Ð°Ð¹ÑÐºÐ°Ñ Ð³Ñ€Ð°Ð¼Ð¾Ñ‚Ð°." (Eto dlya menya kitayskaya gramota.)
    Arabic: "Ù‡Ø°Ø§ ÙƒÙ„Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù„ØµÙŠÙ†ÙŠØ© Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø³Ø¨Ø© Ù„ÙŠ." (Hatha kulluh kalSiniya bilnisba li.)
    Mandarin Chinese: "è¿™å¯¹æˆ‘æ¥è¯´å°±åƒå¤©ä¹¦." (ZhÃ¨ duÃ¬ wÇ’ lÃ¡i shuÅ jiÃ¹ xiÃ ng tiÄnshÅ«.)
    Hindi: "à¤¯à¤¹ à¤®à¥‡à¤°à¥‡ à¤²à¤¿à¤ à¤¸à¤¬ à¤—à¥à¤°à¥€à¤• à¤¹à¥ˆà¥¤" (Yeh mere liye sab Greek hai.)
    Japanese: "ã“ã‚Œã¯ç§ã«ã¨ã£ã¦å…¨ã¦ãŒã‚®ãƒªã‚·ãƒ£èªžã®ã‚ˆã†ã§ã™ã€‚" (Kore wa watashi ni totte subete ga girishago no you desu.)
    Greek: "Î•Î¯Î½Î±Î¹ ÏŒÎ»Î± ÎºÎ¹Î½Î­Î¶Î¹ÎºÎ± Î³Î¹Î± Î¼Î­Î½Î±." (EÃ­nai Ã³la kinÃ©zika gia mÃ©na.)
    
    The phrase "It's all Greek to me" is an idiom that means something is difficult to understand. 
    Each language has a similar phrase, but the specific language used in the phrase can vary. 
    For example, in English we say "It's all Greek to me," but in Spanish and French, the phrase is "It's all Chinese to me." 
    In German, the phrase is "It's all Bohemian villages to me." These different phrases reflect cultural differences in what is considered difficult or foreign.
