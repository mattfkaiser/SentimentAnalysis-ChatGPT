The intention of a eulogy is for you to express your feelings to others about the deceased. Not to complete a writing assignment in a particular kind of way.  People will give you greeting cards with pre-written expressions of sympathy and thatâ€™s OK. Some people read other peoples poetry or play a meaningful song that they did not write at a funeral. 

I have already buried both of my parents and I can tell you from that experience that is incredibly difficult to compose what you want to say, if anything at all, and then perform it for an audience of judgy relativeâ€™s while also trying to navigate your own grief and pain and exhaustion. The expectations we put on the bereaved are, quite frankly, cruel. 

If using a composition engine like chatGPT helps you navigate some of that, Iâ€™m all for it.
