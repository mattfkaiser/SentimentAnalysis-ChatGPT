Wrong, literally tested by asking the same questions for a few particular exams, topics over again. There are some things it can do and hasnâ€™t changed much on. There are so many use cases for chatGPT that even if it has been working perfectly for you it doesnâ€™t mean other people using it for different things and different use case havenâ€™t had a change in experience. 

In my case, when it comes to topics in the insurance industry where things are not always black and white it does need some help. Donâ€™t even get me started on problems that I combine math and insurance and how deductibles, margin clauses, etc apply. In fact, I have some basic problems I can feed it right now that you donâ€™t need a calculator for that it will just get wrong.
