Two computers - work one and personal one. 

Use ChatGPT on your personal computer and add the content to Google Drive.

On your work computer open up a Chrome browser window (if youâ€™re able to use Google Suite) and copy the information from that profile.

Unless theyâ€™re tracking copy and paste from Chrome profile to Chrome profile youâ€™re golden. I do it all the time and no issue.

I donâ€™t email anything as they may be tracking email content and thereâ€™s a direct record of it then especially if the GPT response content contains any info you shouldnâ€™t be using in the prompt.
