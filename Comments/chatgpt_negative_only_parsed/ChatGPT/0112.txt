Iâ€™m an IT Tech/System Admin. Bard is the closest and itâ€™s ass. I pay for ChatGPT Plus and just use the beta plugins. Youâ€™re really not going to find a ChatGPT alternative that is â€œbetterâ€. Almost all alternatives are based off of GPT-3. Google Bard is the closest, because OpenAI used Googleâ€™s AI model (transformer). OpenAI did much better on the nuances end of language, which is why ChatGPT still shits on Bard. OpenAI also used Reddit as one of its teaching aids. Just use it. Yâ€™all are making things harder than they have to be and are still getting ass responses.
