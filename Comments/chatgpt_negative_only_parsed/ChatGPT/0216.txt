Trust me, I have internal conflicts over this stuff nonstop lately yet day by day every scenario I try to play devils advocate with, and then ChatGPT still delivers. Even where itâ€™s not perfect today, itâ€™s just around the corner to where it will be.

I donâ€™t think the problem is Gen AI being the limiting factor, itâ€™s humans not knowing how to utilize it all to the greatest benefit yet. Which in turn is where it gets scary.
