There is no evidence that I've seen that indicates the chatgpt has internalized any general algorithms for any arithmetic math operations.

It gets it right by having seen the exact numbers before in its dataset, or by noticing a math problem and knowing from its pre prompt instructions to feed it into a plugin.

There are no guarantees it will do either of those things every time.
