Bring any brainstorming, older drafts that your printed, any proof of work you did. Bring references, show where you found them. Bring other papers from before ChatGPT was released to compare. 

Also take time to review your argument and language. Make sure you know it (which you should, if you wrote it) and can defend it without GPT. 

If you didnâ€™t cheat, you should have nothing to worry about.
