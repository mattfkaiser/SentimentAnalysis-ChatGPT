I donâ€™t think itâ€™s just a problem with JUST writing (writing essayâ€™s and stuff) but also the problem solving, recently Iâ€™ve realized it gets more problems incorrectIy that before. I have to admit though Iâ€™m good at math most times I re-check my homework with ChatGPT and it *was* a life saver showing me what i possibly got wrong the steps to get the right answer, but now I spend more time checking over the AIâ€™s work than my own because itâ€™s became increasingly more unreliable â€¦
