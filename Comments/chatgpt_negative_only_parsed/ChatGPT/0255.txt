Yikes. You sound like an a grade asshole. If someone tells you your methodology is inaccurate as defense when you accuse them of cheating (serious accusations), you'd not ensure your methods were sound at all? You'd just assume they were even more guilty than you thought before because they had the audacity to suggest maybe you were mistaken.

People like you make me so angry.
