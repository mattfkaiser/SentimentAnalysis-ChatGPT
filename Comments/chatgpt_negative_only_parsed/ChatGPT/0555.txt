I canâ€™t think of a more ill-advised move than this, sorry.


Iâ€™m an attorney working primarily in appeals, which is heavy on the legal writing. Iâ€™ve messed around with ChatGPT a few times out of curiosity. Mind you my writing is a lot more complicated than a standard contract, but the principle still applies. 

ChatGPT sucks for actual legal purposes. Itâ€™s just not at that level yet. It was making up cases in support of my arguments, it was creating and applying completely fictional, entirely indefensible rules and legal tests when it couldnâ€™t find an actual answer.

Not to mention we are a self-regulating profession working within courts and agencies that often donâ€™t even use electronic filing, and run by people who have a deep and abiding disdain for new technology. Itâ€™s not a matter of our system not being in the 21st century- in many cases we havenâ€™t even reached the 90â€™s. All it takes is one asshole judge who still lives in fear of the color television to ruin your life in some cases, tbh.

Get a lawyer. Review it with said lawyer. Fuck, get a paralegal to review it. Anything other than relying on ChatGPT. Youâ€™re going to end up fucking yourself over.
