ChaltGPT is all nice and dandy but it's not a true AI in the sense it doesn't have any intelligence of its own (can't take over the world) and cannot ever replace humans. 

Fast forward 2050, no online places like reddit and stack exchange will have any posts and we will all be stuck with old info because google doesn't exist and chatGPT only can give us info based on what's been written in the past. 

Also did you know that ChatGPT was used by certain organizations as far back as 2018.
