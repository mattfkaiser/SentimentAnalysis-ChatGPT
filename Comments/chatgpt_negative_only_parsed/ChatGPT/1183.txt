Yeah, that's my point - who in their right mind would trust that answer when the program itself states that it is impossible to know. It's stupid to believe this and fail students based on this false information.

Top universities in my country rely on oral exam so even if you used chatGPT to write your essays that doesn't really matter in terms of accurately grading you. Even if you write your thesis that way you still have to defend in person in front of a jury. There's just a lot of hoops you have to jump through to even begin your career in academics so using chatGPT is just pointless, the second you're caught slacking and trying to cheat it's more or less over for you.
