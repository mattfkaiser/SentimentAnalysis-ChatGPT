This is why chatgpt, despite its potential, is useless for creative writing.

Especially the tendency to turn everyone into "good people", which means you have no real human beings, no real conflict.

Everyone gets along, everyone is tolerant, the world shines under rainbows and unicorns and under the cruel heavy iron yoke of mandated conformity to woke ideology
