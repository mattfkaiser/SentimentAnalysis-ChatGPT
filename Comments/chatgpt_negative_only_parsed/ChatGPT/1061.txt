Have you somehow missed the 100,000 articles, blog posts, videos, etc where someone says "ChatGPT says" or "AI predicts" or whatever else. Or all of the "I've contrived a scenario where I have 2 responses agree with, or anger, my own political leanings!".

Some people out there really seem to feel they are having an actual conversation and/or are receiving the full factual thoughts and opinions of the people behind ChatGPT based on responses. I have legit seen people calling for violence against the devs/owners based on prompt responses. 

I honestly wouldn't blame the people running chatGPT if they purely were adding restrictions because enough loud-mouth-breathers are in fact acting like children. However I suspect theres some level of fear of legal issues, and maybe a bit of fear of actual wackos doing violence.
