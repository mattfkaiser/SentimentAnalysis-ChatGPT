ðŸ’œ I lost my brother, mother and father in 9 months during the pandemic. None to COVID but the pandemic stopped me from being able to visit my elderly parents in different states. My brother died in a car accident and it made the funeral complicated and many people couldnâ€™t go. COVID deaths are an extra trauma, there was so much chaos and people losing people.  Itâ€™s brave you are writing letters, I had that suggested and still am not ready. The OP has given me some ideas on how to use chatgpt. I have been using it in other supportive ways. I finally am getting a therapist a year after the back to back deaths. Kinda funny that the grief groups wouldnâ€™t take me because they said I needed some one-to-one a whole year after my mom passed. Really goes to show how long it can take.
