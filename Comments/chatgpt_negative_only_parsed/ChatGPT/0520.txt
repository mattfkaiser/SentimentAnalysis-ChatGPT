Iâ€™m a physician with experience in cancer genomics and ML/NN. Iâ€™m a firm believer ChatGPT4 is a good tool to summarize results and help with literature review. However, you do need to know that youâ€™re talking about to begin with. Hallucination is a real phenomenon, specially in complex topics such as cancer diagnostics/research. Perhaps retraining it with oncology papers/literature would be the way to go forward (this would be the case for any discipline, really.)
