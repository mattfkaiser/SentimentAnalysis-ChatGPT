Iâ€™ve requested ChatGPT to do some math for me and on three occasions, they were incorrect. When I told ChatGPT that there was an error in its calculations, it just inputted my answer, instead of actually properly solving the equation. It still didnâ€™t change the error. When I brought it up again that itâ€™s still wrong, it suddenly crashed and I got a technical error. So I find all these posts highly suspicious.
