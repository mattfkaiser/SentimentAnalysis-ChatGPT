Primarily to just find the answer to random questions that come up. I always fact check them afterwards but it saves me time. 

Eg. This morning I didnâ€™t know what an â€œunincorporated areaâ€ in my province or how it is run. ChatGPT explained it in 5 seconds. I Googled the answer and I found the official sources that confirmed this. It probably cut the amount of â€œresearchâ€ time in half.
