You mentioned that you wrote this in word. Check version history, you can search for it in the top bar. It should be fairly obvious that you did not use ChatGPT if there are multiple snapshots of your essay coming together. Email that file to your professor and explain how to use Version History, along with a source from Microsoft talking about how to use Version History.

Now if did use ChatGPT, itâ€™ll be best to bite the bullet. Showing that the AI detection tool has false-positives only shows that there is the possibility that you didnâ€™t cheat, not that you didnâ€™t cheat. Assuming your teacher/professor is good, theyâ€™ll work with you to find other ways of determining whether you wrote your essay yourself or not, and if theyâ€™re bad, theyâ€™ll assume guilt until proven innocent. Based on the tone of this email it looks like youâ€™re luckily getting the former which means not being antagonistic is a good first step. If did you ChatGPT and you waste your teacherâ€™s time as they determine through other more solid evidence than TurnItIn that you did not do the whole essay yourself (and it would be fairly clear with version history and editing time which one it is), or try to obsfucate/withhold the evidence, then you will be in much more trouble than if you come clean. Weâ€™re still in early days of AI so itâ€™s possible (and based on the tone decently likely), that in the worst case you would just be forced to rewrite the essay but in your own style, and given a warning. If you waste the teacherâ€™s time and lie to them, you could face much more severe punishments depending on what level of education youâ€™re in and the relevant policies. So only fight on this if you actually did not use ChatGPT to write your essay and you have evidence to back that up.
