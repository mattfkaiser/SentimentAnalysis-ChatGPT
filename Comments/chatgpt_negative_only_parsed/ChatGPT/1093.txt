We have to be brutal to this but itâ€™s necessary,  anyone who disagrees is a complete idiot.  

â€œArtificial intelligence could lead to the extinction of humanity, experts - including the heads of OpenAI and Google Deepmind - have warned.

Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Demis Hassabis, chief executive of Google DeepMind and Dario Amodei of Anthropic have all supported the statement.
Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who issued an earlier warning about risks from super-intelligent AI, has also supported the callâ€
