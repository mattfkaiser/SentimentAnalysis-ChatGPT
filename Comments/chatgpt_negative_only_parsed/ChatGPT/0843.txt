Oh, my bad but usually, I would advise you to not take health related advice from chatGPT, not more than the surface level at least.

I assume that you most probably do not have the medical background to verify or cross check the remedy/recommendation provided by the AI.

Try changing the therapist, if itâ€™s not working out for you.
