Your professor is bullshitting, I went to Chatgpt to get an example of Chatgpt claiming it wrote something I wrote myself however it refused by saying it couldn't possibly know. If your professor did force Chatgpt to give a response then Chatgpt would've made it abundantly clear it's guess was unfounded so then I'd write someone higher up in the school with concerns about a student potentially having been willfully falsely suspended
