Yea itâ€™s weird. I even threw the postâ€™s chatGPT response  into chatGPT asking what the tone was to make sure I wasnâ€™t reading it in a sensitive way.

To psychoanalysis the commenters a bit, they probably communicate in a similar way (online and in real life) and are self conscious that they are perceived to be condescending. So now theyâ€™re trying to argue against that idea to preserve their ego.
