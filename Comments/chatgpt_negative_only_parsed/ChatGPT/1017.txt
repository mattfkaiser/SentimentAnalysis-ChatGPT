What is 6 plus 8

ChatGPT

The sum of 6 and 8 is 14.

No it is 24

I'm sorry, but the correct sum of 6 and 8 is indeed 14, not 24. Adding 6 and 8 together gives you a total of 14.

Thats false!

I apologize if there was any confusion. However, mathematically, the sum of 6 and 8 is indeed 14. If you believe there is an error, please double-check your calculations or provide additional context for your statement.
