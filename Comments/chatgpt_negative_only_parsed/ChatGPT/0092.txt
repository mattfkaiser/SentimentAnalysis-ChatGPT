I wrote my mom letters for a couple years when she passed. In truth is was me journaling through my grief, but she was the one Iâ€™d turn to when horrible things would happen so even a one-sided conversation helped provide me some level of reassurance. Had ChatGPT been around at the time, maybe I would have used it the same way. I remember wishing for some way to properly say goodbye. 

Loss is such a complex experience to navigate. Itâ€™s hard to fault someone for the things they do to get through it. Youâ€™re not hurting anyone and youâ€™re aware itâ€™s not real.

Iâ€™m so sorry for your loss.
