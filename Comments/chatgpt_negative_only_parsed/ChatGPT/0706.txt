If youâ€™re dumb enough to rely fully on this technology thatâ€™s in its infancy, youâ€™re probably too dumb to put in good prompts and validate the responses for accuracy.

Coincidentally, you are making yourselves more stupid by taking shortcuts and undermining the natural learning process of the brain. Whether you cheated by plagiarizing from an online source or cheated with chatgpt, you *still cheated and learned nothing*.

Wikipedia is quite frankly a better source of information than chatgpt because there are actually links to the original sources. It can summarize and organize information all day (hint: part of that learning process mentioned above that youâ€™re now missing out on), but it doesnâ€™t *understand the information*.
