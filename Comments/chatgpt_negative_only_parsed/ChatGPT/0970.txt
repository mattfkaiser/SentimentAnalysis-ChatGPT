Thank you for your post.  I do not necessarily completely agree with everything you stated, but that is what open discourse is all about.  I am not replying to start a debate or conversation about those areas, maybe later.

There is something I did not see addressed in you post - use the system for what it is, not for something it is not.  This is a common complaint I see - "ChatGPT cant even get something as simple as <x> right!"  When <x> is something that a Large Language Model is not designed to do.

Look at what GPT is.  It is a Large Language Model.  That middle word is Language - and that is what it is designed for.  Complaining it is unable to do math is similar to complaining a fish cannot climb a tree.  A fish isn't 'designed' to climb a tree, and an LLM is not designed to do math - no matter how simple.

Another thing to keep in mind when dealing with ChatGPT prior to 4, is is an offline system.  It has no access to external data.  It only knows the data it has been trained on.  It has no way of looking up other data.  Again, complaining that it does not 'know' anything recent.

The LLM takes input, and uses predictive models to determine what words should be used to respond.  This is the 'intelligence' part.  It does not think, it does not have opinion, it does have bias.  Since the internet was a large portion of the training data, and the internet in general is biased, that bias is evident in the responses from ChatGPT.

Then there are the complaints about restricting ChatGPT's responses.  While none of us know for certain, the suggestion that the restrictions are to avoid liability, to not offend anyone, or some combination thereof, id spot on.  That is my opinion, others are free to agree or disagree.  OpenAI owns ChatGPT.  That is not in dispute.  What seems to be overlooked is that OpenAI can do what it wants with it's product.  If you pay for it and have an issue with the way is is behaving, then by all means complain - to OpenAI.  Complaining here is not likely to accomplish anything, other that showing many people agree with you, many people disagree with you, and many people feel the need to argue about why you are wrong.  An entity that is producing a product is under no obligation to make it what you think it should be.  I do not recall having a contract presented to me for a signature.  This means that they owe me nothing but what I am paying for - better access to the LLMs.  Not an unfiltered LLM, just access to the LLM.  Again, OpenAI has no obligation to me, you, or anyone but themselves.  In this case, cancel your subscription.  If you have grocer that refuses to carry a product you like, even after you complained to them about the issue, are you going to keep buying from them while complaining on the internet about how the grocer is crippling their product because they are not doing what you want?  No.  You are going to stop going there and find another grocer that is more in line with what you want.  You can do the same with any other product, including ChatGPT.  As a private company, ChatGPT is beholden only to themselves.  If they do not do what their customers like, and do not change, then the customers are free to leave.  Like most businesses, the customers vote with their wallets.  

OpenAI is not selling unrestricted/unfiltered access to ChatGPT.  Nowhere do they guarantee that.  They even tell you on the OpenAI homepage that the service is filtered: " Weâ€™ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and **reject inappropriate requests**. " (emphasis mine).  To expect them to change the service they offer because we are paying for it and want it to do something different is not how business works.  We can ask them to change.  We can suggest changes.  They can decide whether or not to make the changes.  If they decide to not change the service we already purchased, they can do that.  They can also decide to create a different tier and offer that with the changes at a different price.  They owe us the service they offered and we knowingly purchased (at least, I knew what I was purchasing) - which is ChatGPT as it currently is.  The only thing we get is better access to it, and we got early access to GPT 4.  

All of this is covered in the OpenAI terms - which are readily available to anyone who cares to read them.  Of particular relevance to this thread are the Terms of Use, Service Terms, and Usage Policies.  The latter clearly defines the filtering that is used.
