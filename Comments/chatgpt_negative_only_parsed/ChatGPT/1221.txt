Iâ€™ve just run all of my essays, including some work that hasnâ€™t been published yet, and nothing was flagged as â€˜written by chatGPTâ€™.  
  
Maybe an odd case of model overfitting? Too many people asking (whether from an academic perspective or from a panicked student one) whether itâ€™s written something to the point where the model now flags it has written it.
