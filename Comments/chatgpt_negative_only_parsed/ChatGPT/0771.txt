Why do people keep saying this? Anything at the level of a university level math course, and a calculator is kinda useless beyond the most trivial arithmetic operations. 

For the fancier calculators that can do integrals, guess what, the university screens your calculator to make sure it is not one of those calculators, OR they have a selection of calculators that you must choose from in order to complete the exam. 

For all these people using chatgpt, all I can say is, what are you going to do during the in person pen and paper exam where no internet is required and you don't have a deep understanding of the subject matter nor any practice with the art of essay writing. The professor is going to know which students used chatgpt to cheat and which students didn't pretty quickly.
