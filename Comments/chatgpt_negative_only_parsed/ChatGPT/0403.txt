RIP your dad.

But what do you think he'd prefer? 

An eloquent, smooth essay with no grammar mistakes, no run on sentences, etc?

Or a crude speech with all the mistakes and imperfections of yours that he and your family were used to in all those years?

I know that if it were me in a casket, I'd pick the latter 100%. This is a personal moment between you and your dad, not an essay writing contest where people'd grade your speech. So, I don't think using chatGPT would make the letter "better" in that sense.
