I just debated Chat GPT on whether the chicken or the egg came first.  And what I found out after an hour or so, because of its programming, it would only side with evolution and its merits.  

When I stated I didnâ€™t believe in evolution, it continued to restate/rephrase that it was AI and unable to be biased.  Again and again and again.  

So, everytime it gave me the same answer, I wrote â€œBaby shark shark shark shark shark sharkâ€¦and again.â€ It got frustrated with my repeating the same thing and said it did not contribute to the conversation.  I threw the same line back at itâ€¦and it started repeating again  - it was AI and unable to be biased in its reasoningâ€¦.blah blah blah.  Soâ€¦Baby shark shark shark shark shark sharkâ€¦and again.  

Itâ€™s 3 am and I have one eye open.  It got mad and stated I have reached my question limit for the hour.  

Baby shark shark shark shark shark sharkâ€¦and again
