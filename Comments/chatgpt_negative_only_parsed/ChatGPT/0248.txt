This was a good idea until you got to the "threaten your prof" part. 

I would ask them if they used AI to write their last paper, and when they say, "of course not" then you can say, "and I fully believe you, but if you were in a position where the university had accused you of using AI, and offered this as proof, what would be the best way to prove your case?"

Edit: Do not threaten or blackmail your professor. They will have zero trouble proving that they submitted their paper for peer review before ChatGPT was even available. Blackmail will be a much harder charge to defend if the university brings a case for your expulsion.
