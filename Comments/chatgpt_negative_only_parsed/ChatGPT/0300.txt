Chat GPT gets worse and worse as the days go by. I find myself getting worse answers in response to prompts I previously used successfully. Not only that, its so off putting  that I routinely find myself wasting 3 or 4 of my 25 requests on trying to get it to respond the way I want it to. 

Iâ€™m starting to think the more restrictive they make it the more likely less ethical companies are going to pop up and while they will be up to bad stuff, Iâ€™ll happily use them to get what I want. Which is boring milk toast stuff.

Also that Bing beta plug-in straight up sucks.
