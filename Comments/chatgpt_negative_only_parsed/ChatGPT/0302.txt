On it explaining, you can reduce that by telling it not to. Write your command. At the end, say â€œDonâ€™t explain what it does. Donâ€™t include any other ChatGPT messages in your response. Just (goal here).â€ I also tell it how to format the response itself sometimes.

These tricks work sometimes. They donâ€™t work other times. (Shrugs.)
