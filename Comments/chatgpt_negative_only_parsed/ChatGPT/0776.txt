Yeah, it's mostly a question of writing the first draft. I used to take so much time writing that one that once I finished it it was already time to turn it in, and in my university you don't get to argue with professors. If I miss the deadline for an assignment, I'm disqualified from giving the exam and must try a second time during the summer semester, so I never took a chance and always sent in the first draft, even though I wasn't satisfied with it. I tend to be perennially unsatisfied with my work, and let me tell you, ever since chatgpt came out, I've stopped losing hair over assignments.
