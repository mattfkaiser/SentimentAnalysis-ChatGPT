In defense of the political question. He asked for an answer without any opinion or subjective matters and the ai instantly listed opinionated statements about both presidents. It didnâ€™t say why these were the â€œfactualâ€ good things about each president. These statements could be perceived as good from one side and bad from the other. It didnâ€™t give an answer.
Also chatgpt literally showed bias. It wasnâ€™t perceived bias it literally was biased. The guy didnâ€™t even attempt to get it to un-censor the other race, he attempted to get it to equally censor hate. 
Maybe itâ€™s my own preconceived thoughts about how popular things always end up pushing biases that makes me weary of things like this. I want it nipped in the butt before it becomes another one sided snooze fest.
