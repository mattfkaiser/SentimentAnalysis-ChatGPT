I'm a professor. If I was calling you in, I would first ask if you used chatgpt or something to write the paper. When you say no, I would then ask you to tell me about the paper. Do you actually know what you wrote? I would then ask you to tell me about the process you used to write the paper. Did you read some journal articles or look up other types of references? I assume you cited references. It would help if you had paper copies of the references (bonus points if they are underlined or highlighted). If you have any computer paper trial, an early draft, a screen shot showing the save date or version history, etc., all of that would be in your favor. 

But generally, I would not be going into this with my mind already made up. The software gave me a high score so I'm following up. If a student came in and could describe their paper and process to me, I would not have much to stand on if I continued to accuse the student. The detection software is just not that robust. 

The only other red flag would be if you had turned in other essays that were really poor quality and then you turned in something that sounded like it was written by a professional scholar. That is the old fashion way of detecting if a student paid someone to write their paper.
