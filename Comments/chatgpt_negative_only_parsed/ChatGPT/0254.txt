As a teacher, I am just avoiding proving anyone is using AI because I know the futility. However I also have seen people who can barely make a cogent argument first semester, suddenly being supremely eloquent. I also have seen people try real hard on what assignment and turn in crap for others, so I am trying to adjust my curriculum rather than hunt for cheaters.

Howeverâ€¦if I was the type of teacher to want to bust someone for ChatGPT, being presented with mountains of â€œhereâ€™s how you canâ€™t prove its not ChatGPTâ€ when I make an accusation, would just prove beyond a doubt that you were using it.
