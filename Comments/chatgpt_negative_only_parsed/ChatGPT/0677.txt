currently ChatGPT has no short term memory. Ask it a riddle and when it gets it wrong give it the answer then ask the riddle again - it gets it wrong in perpetuity. They need to give it at least short term memory. How the hell do you have a conversation with something when it can't remember what you just told it!!
