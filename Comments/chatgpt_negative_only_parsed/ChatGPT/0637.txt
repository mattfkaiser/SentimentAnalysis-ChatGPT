By the time they implement it into their classes, it will be outdated. I would tell them to let it go and focus more on stylistic development so that their students have some breathing room to give a fuck about writing and finding their voice. Everything GPT writes is mind-numbingly cliche, it takes the shortest path by nature, and therefore the most tired.

This is really what you want to develop professionally anyway. Communication is much more than grammar and the correct structure applied to the correct context. Different businesses will have different style rules if you're doing technical writing - if your students aren't thinking critically about that they're at a serious disadvantage.

If I were an English teacher right now I would be using ChatGPT examples as a *treasure vault* of boring short stories, boring listicles, boring resumes that you can use without humiliating any one student. This subtly reinforces that, even if they can't prove it, even if it's just a normal boring essay, they can *tell* you're dialing it in. Tear its work up, turn your eye-rolls over stylistic blunders into honor-roll- ah for fuck's sake it's rubbed off, get it off of me! Get it off!

Yeah, anyway. You get the idea. We finally have a good, repeatable example of trashy try-hard grammatically *mundane* writing, so *use that.*
