I use old.reddit in my browser with uBlock Origin and I don't get ads (except arguably astroturfing).

I subscribe to a select few Youtube channels and don't get spam - except one of the channels has now started releasing a bunch of fucking "shorts" that are annoying (clips from their longer videos) and as far as I can tell, I can't easily filter those. 

So for the most part, with a little effort, I think you can work around some problems.

Also, for ChatGPT: https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat&model=gpt-3.5-turbo-0301

The playground is a great tool. Costs around â…“Â¢ per interaction (based on my experience). I use the "full chat" mode because there's a system box (tell it how to act), then you enter your prompt - make it something ChatGPT wouldn't refused, and hit submit. Then you can ***edit*** all fo those including its reply. Once you edit its reply to cross a boundary that normal ChatGPT wouldn't cross, it tends to answer pretty much whatever you want with few complaints. And if it complains, edit your system box.

That said, the max length of the entire conversation is the token length - but 4096 tokens is more than you might think.
