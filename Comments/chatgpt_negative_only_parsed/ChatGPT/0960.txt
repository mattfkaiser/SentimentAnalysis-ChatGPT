Is that what it is? A US thing? I've been baffled by all of these posts (I'm from the UK) basically saying Open AI's disclaimers are meaningless. In the UK, if you're told not to do something and then you do it, it's almost always on you. There are caveats, but nothing like crazy comparisons I've seen posted here over the past few days. Someone compared the disclaimer on ChatGPT legal advice to someone putting a bomb in their garden and a sign telling people not to enter. .. I mean... It's not remotely the same thing.
