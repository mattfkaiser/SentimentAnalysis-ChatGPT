>ChatGPT is not for giving me the answer, it's for helping me ask the right questions.

This is the way to use it. Not coding myself but use it for finding information in general. Instead of multiple Google searches without luck I ask ChatGPT and maybe find that one relevant search term I'm looking for. Then go ahead and find reliable sources.
