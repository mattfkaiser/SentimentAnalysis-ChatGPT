As a teacher the mentality isnâ€™t stupid. 

You know how much you get paid and ChatGPT is going to make your job exponentially harder. No one will be paying you any more for your harder job, so get out now if you donâ€™t want a harder job for less pay.

Are there solutions and work arounds to ChatGPT? Sure.  You can have everyone write their essays by hand. Have you read 150 hand written essays? Grammar checking alone probably quintuples time. 25% of them will be almost illegible with another 25% so hard to read as taken extra time. You canâ€™t search their docs for use of key terms or people. The list goes on and on.

Are these problems solvable? Sure. But its going to take years of hard work to sort out. Some students and parents are going to be aggressively angry about the solutions. 

But right now? Most teachers already get paid like crap (even at the college level) and the job just got worse. So letâ€™s not shit on teachers complaining.
