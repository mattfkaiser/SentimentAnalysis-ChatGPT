This is what folks donâ€™t understand today. ChatGPT is a toy unless you understand the power of prompts. This can also be true for google if you never learned the endless ways to actually use it, just entering a search term is meaningless.

Iâ€™m one of those guys who can read code, I canâ€™t write code. I can take snippets off W3schools or somewhere and make it work.

With ChatGPT, I have no doubt I could rival anyone with a decade of experience. Itâ€™s stupid how well it can accomplish things when you put effort into it. Sure, it does require some effort, and sometimes a lot, but the reality being in a few days (hell, a few hours) you can build a functioning game, that would take a normal engineer 6 months of training, another 3 months of build time, 3 months of depression over something not working, and another 2 months to finish it up. 

Itâ€™s wild how game changing this is, and weâ€™re just in the second inning.
