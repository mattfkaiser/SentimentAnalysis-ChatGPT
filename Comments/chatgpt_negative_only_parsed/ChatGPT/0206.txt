A feature of the American health care system is blame, guilt, and shame. When my mother in law had a stroke friends, family, and doctors all were like she should have come in sooner and also keep trying to blame her for the root cause (blood pressure).

I was like WTF yâ€™all? She had literal brain damage and they were all mad that she wasnâ€™t thinking clearly?  Especially mad was my SIL - a literal doctor.

One of the symptoms of rabido is confusion so good on you for going to the hospital when you did. You did good to even ask ChatGPT. 

If the doctor continues to imply another root cause than exercise - ask he test you for whatever those alternatives are and ask that he document your request for additional testing in your chart. Including if he assumes youâ€™re on drugs.
