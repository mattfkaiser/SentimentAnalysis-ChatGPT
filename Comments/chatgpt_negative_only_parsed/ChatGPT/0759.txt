What ChatGPT does best is create language, so fields where student writing has been used as a measure of knowledge and achievement are going to be more spooked by ChatGPT.

There are plenty of ways to get around this (in-class work, more individually tailored assignments that don't lend themselves to generic responses, increased focus on drafting and revisions, individual conferences to figure out if students can "own" their writing and really understand it). But many of these methods are potentially logistically complicated and difficult to scale to larger classes and align with remote instruction.

So I can see humanities professors who have relied on student papers to assess performance struggling to adjust to ChatGPT.
