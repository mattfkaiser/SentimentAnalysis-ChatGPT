Yup. I'm with you 10000%, and I'm one of those pricks that has optimised the living shit out of my Seo to get our [KombuchaWOW](https://kombuchawow.com) site ranking on the first page of Google. I absolutely hated every single minute of writing content that would rank for google Seo rather than people, although the official line is the other way around. I saw the GoogleIO new search product demo video the same as you all a few days back, and it will be the absolute death of websites and traffic unless they're a current affairs site, an ecomm site (like ours) or a community site. In fact, you can already see google wanting to become Shopify in its plans - so no traffic to our ecomm site even - the transaction takes place on google surfaces. Rolling with it all, but ChatGPT has changed the game for the better.
