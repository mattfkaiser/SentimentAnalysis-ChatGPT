What an interesting coincidence that only a few days ago you commented this on a post asking whether Chat GPT plagiarism checkers can be bypassed:

"fella in my roommates business class got pulled into his lecturers office and because he couldnâ€™t recite the info she failed him immediately, iâ€™ve heard of it happening a few times now but not to anyone i know directly. Our university sent out an email explaining that theyâ€™re using TurnItIns detection software but itâ€™s supposedly bullshit, im just waiting for the university to fail someone who actually did the work and watch them get sued because i think thatâ€™s the only way theyâ€™ll realize itâ€™s faulty as shit."
