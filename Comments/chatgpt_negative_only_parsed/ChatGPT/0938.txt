That conversation leak glitch was visual and as far as i know, chatgpt doesnt hold memories of previous conversations which is why this wouldnt be possible. History of conversations are stored on their servers which chatgpt doesnt have access to (hence why all sessions are separate) you can try asking chatgpt to remember what it said in a previous chat but it wont be able to access it because it literally doesnt have that information
