ChatGPT is a language model based on mimicry. It has been fed a shit ton of data but it can not discern if something is true or false. It canâ€™t reason. It doesnâ€™t know you are a person. It is generating text based on prediction from its data set. 

I, personally, would not call it an AI. Itâ€™s not general or specific or specialized. It is a tool. The danger is when people think that tool is more than it is.

It definitely wonâ€™t be taking anyoneâ€™s job. Unless youâ€™re really bad at your job and your job was to generate text.
