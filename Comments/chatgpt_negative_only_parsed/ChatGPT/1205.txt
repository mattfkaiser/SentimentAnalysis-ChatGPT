The thing is, ChatGPT doesnâ€™t â€œknowâ€ anything. Itâ€™s a data model using billions of parameters to produce an outcome most suited to the input. Itâ€™s not a precise and accurate way of marking work, itâ€™s lazy and ignorant to assume that ChatGPT has this level of functionality yet.

Fuck this professor and fight back if it ever happens to you.
