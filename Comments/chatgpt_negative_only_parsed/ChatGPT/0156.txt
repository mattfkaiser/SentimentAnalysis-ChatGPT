The problem is its gotten lazy, I think they've done this to save processing power. I used to give it one prompt for a function or code block and it write the whole thing . Now it'll give a super basic answer with the bare minimum to answer the question then it'll say "the rest of your code goes here"... like really? This is relatively new thing too because as far back as March it wasn't doing this. May have started this in late April or so. It's really annoying is you have premium too because you'll burn up 3 or 4 of your prompts trying to get it to give you a complete answer like the old chatgpt. Then your at 25 and back to crappy 3.5 for 3 hours
