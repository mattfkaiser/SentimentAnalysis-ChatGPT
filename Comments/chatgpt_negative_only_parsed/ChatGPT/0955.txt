A lot of people circulate that gpt4 has about 1 trillion parameters, but OpenAI hasnâ€™t said. 

Iâ€™ve been learning about neural networks from a variety of sources, including chat gpt4, and it says that parameters are essentially equivalent to the weights and biases. Thatâ€™s in line with the below article on parameters. Please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.
