i live in a rural area, and asked for some guidance to grow tobacco , since i was planning on doing it , it gave me a mile long preach about why it's bad and i shouldn't do it .dude i am asking for humidity and weather suitable for farming tobbaco just give me the info without the sanctimoniousness ,i don't need a lecture everytime I ask chatgpt for things, 
and for all those people who think only pervs are getting rejected ,it's not like that.
furthermore not everyone is in USA, and not everyone's morals and culture is the same ,it's double annoying for people outside USA who don't subscribe to the American brand of batshit crazy which has become the normal over there, its fun laughing at the American shinanigans but being lectured on them is not, 
my wife was 18 years and one week old when we got married ,what if she was 17 or 16 which is normal in my country , so would chatgpt start calling people a pedophile if they ask for ideas for their wife's 18th birthday? wtf? where does it end? chat gpt is disrupting the whole world but only preaching the american crazy.
