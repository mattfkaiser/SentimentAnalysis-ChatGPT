In case you didn't read, the OP said he is clueless about programming. No one said anything about learning new languages after learning a previous one. Once you know the basic concepts of programming, you can easily move to other languages (some of course are harder than others). All programmers know this, I learn programming 3 years ago and am proficient in at least 5 languages now without ChatGPT, not sure why it took you 25 years with ChatGPT to do so.
