I use it for life coaching similar to what I use my actual psych for. The main reason that a psych is worth paying for still is that chatGPT just knows what you tell it. It cant hypothesize about underlying things you may not be aware of. It cant drive a conversation to really even search for things unless you tell it to aggressively.  I use it for this stuff, but I also have a weekly session with a real professional for a reason. If yours is doing a bad job, find a new one.
