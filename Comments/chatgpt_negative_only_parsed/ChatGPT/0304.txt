I had this exact thought last night!

Previously it would be absolutely fantastic at not only providing me code or insights on fixing some code, but also detailed instructions on how to implement it.

Yesterday when using it I would get scrambled answers with a lot of incorrect information and inconsistencies. The instructions it would try to provide didn't seem as good as before.

One time it told me it was too difficult and I should look into another method. I tried the same question with Bard and it provided me the information I needed.

ChatGPT still provides better instructions for what I was working on than Bard. Because of this I've been taking the answer that Bard provides me and submitting that to Chat GPT. I then ask it to give me the instructions on how to accomplish what Bard instructed me to do.

That seemed to be working for me for now but is a pain.
