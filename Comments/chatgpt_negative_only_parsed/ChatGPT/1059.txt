External long term memory systems for ChatGPT already exist. Iâ€™m actually working on them. Look into cognitive architecture. GPT is the most important tool for an autonomous agent, but itâ€™s not the only one. AGI should be here by the end of the year. It might not be as good as a human, fast, or cheap, but itâ€™s coming. 2 years from now and shit will be wild (artificial super intelligence) unless something fetters technological progress like extreme legislation, massive chip shortages, or a world war.
