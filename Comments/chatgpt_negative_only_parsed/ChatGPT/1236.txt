Hey man,

So these types of 'threat statements' from professors are completely hollow, and definitively in your favor should they accuse you. The fact of the matter is, using ChatGPT for an outline or studying is not plagiarism. And as you can see, you have definitive proof that despite you writing the material, ChatGPT will hallucinate a reply and claim it wrote it.

A good way to discredit these things, although you shouldn't have to, is to run content from other sources into an AI content dectector. I put content from my book into an AI content detector, and it says some human sections are 90% AI written. Ironically, the sections I did write using AI, near verbatim, are '60.4%' human. These things are bogus, in case they try to head down that route. You can also directly trick ChatGPT into thinking it wrote content as it misunderstands prompts, and I'm almost certain professors are simply saying this as a threat to scare what students off that they can.

What you need to do is make sure you're able to defend yourself, and do not give in to pressure to admit to anything you haven't. Double down on your defense, and if they impose serious penalties or academic discipline, you have a strong case for a lawsuit on your hand. Of course, use the reasonable methods prior to escalating, but just record and document everything just in case.
