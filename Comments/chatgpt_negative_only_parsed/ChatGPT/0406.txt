I'd say so. You're his son, and they should be your words. No shame in looking at the way ChatGPT structures sentences and paragraphs since that's just making things grammatically correct, but if you died and your son just put his thoughts into a LLM and regurgitated the results would you not be offended?

Personally, I'd prefer if someone at my funeral completely messed it up than do something technically correct but did not come from them.
