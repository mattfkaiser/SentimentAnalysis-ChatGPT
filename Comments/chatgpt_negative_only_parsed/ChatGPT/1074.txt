This post is entirely nonsense.  The OP claimed "ChatGPT got castrated" when in fact he got a randomly bad answer.

This repeats itself almost daily in these threads - a one time randomly bad answer is extrapolated to mean OpenAI is worsening the product.

It's simply not true.  It doesn't matter how many people mistakenly believe it.  When you dig in, you find "oh, yeah, if I just try again it's fine."

The thing is random.  You have to try multiple times to make sure you get the best answer.  That does not imply it is getting worse over time - just that most people are unable to understand this.

Only the ones in your own mind.
