I'm gonna have to disagree. chatgpt can't write something better for your dad than you can. 

It may sound better but does it matter? You are the only you that exists.  Which do you think would have more meaning? Something that sounds nice or something you wrote?  Unless your dad was into computers to an insane degree I don't think there is a world where prettier words would mean more than something truly heart felt.

I'm sorry for your loss.  That is a terrible time.
