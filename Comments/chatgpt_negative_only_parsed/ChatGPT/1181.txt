So I ran a small test, and GPT said it wrote all 10 of the essays I gave it, ranging from ones written by me to group assignments, it said all of them were written by ChatGPT. I have even reached out to a few people to get stuff written by them to test if maybe just the Legal writing style is particularly similar to ChatGPT, but I suspect that's unlikely. I fully expect ChatGPT will just report everything as being written by ChatGPTâ€”likely because it's plausible that â€¦ anything was written by ChatGPT.
