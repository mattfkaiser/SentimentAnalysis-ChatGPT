Can you quickly outline how this works? I didn't have a chance to take a look at Plugin development.

So I guess chatgpt is generating the Javascript code on its own based on your prompt. Then, it evaluates the code using your plugin. I guess it prints the contents of your lyrics files, but how is that content actually given to chatgpt?

Does chatgpt prompt itself with that content?
