>many students who are not aware of the problem that direct answers are barely relevant

Unfortunately, we will have to help them become aware. This has always been the case. chatGPT only makes this *slightly* easier.  USENET for example, has terabytes worth of term papers a student could download and hand in as their own.

>One could argue that they are only hurting themselves

If no one is actually explaining best practices in practical usage then I would argue we are failing them by allowing them to "only hurt themselves"

We have to explicitly tell them: "if you use chatGPT on the job and you just copy and paste without understanding, you will lose that job." Some kids unfortunately will have to learn the hard way but there are a far greater number of kids who won't.
