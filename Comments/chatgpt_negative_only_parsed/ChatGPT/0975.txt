There is no good reason for OpenAI to open any doors that put the technology in a bad light. 

That users canâ€™t get it to write erotica, or they feel like itâ€™s overly â€œwokeâ€, or are upset that they canâ€™t get it to make a joke about a black woman, or whatever elseâ€¦ itâ€™s not the type of thing that is going to earn them a headline in USA Todayâ€¦ but â€œChatGPT Generates Neo-Nazi Newsletterâ€ is a terrible look for a company trying to get its tech out there. 

Itâ€™s just good business to try to avoid controversy on a technology which is already sure to evoke fear and uncertainty for people, and is certainly a target for regulatory bodies around the globe.
