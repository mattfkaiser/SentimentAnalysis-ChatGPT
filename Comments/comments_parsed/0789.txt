""End to end encryption"" just means that nobody inbetween can intercept the message (which already exists and is being used with ChatGPT requests) - there's no such thing as a type of encryption where the recipient of a message can both use the message and also is unable to decrypt the message at the same time.. that's just nonsense - the recipient of the message has to be able to decrypt the message if they're going to do anything with it. This is a problem where people don't trust the recipient of the message, not a problem of the message being intercepted, and that isn't a problem that any kind of encryption could ever solve."
"I'm an English teacher and I use ChatGPT to make exercises and tests, but I also engage with all my students, so I know when they have handed in work that they aren't capable of producing.
