But what does ChatGPT say?
"I feel like this is meant to be a defense for people, but reads as another reason chatgpt has an advantage."
Well at least this is proving that Chat GPT is better at pretending to be a doctor than randos are
"I don’t think so… these are voluntary answers too.. but i also do not doubt the warm vibes i feel reading chatgpt’s responses to my personal abd medical questions. Very comforting, balanced, and knowledgeable"
"Instead of double blind, have the patient be diagnosed by the doctor, then feed the info (minus doctor diagnosis) to chatgpt, that way they're still getting advice from a doctor, but you can compare if the ai gave a different diagnosis. Later on, you can see whether the doctor was right.
