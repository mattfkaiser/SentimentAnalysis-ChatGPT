You are probably right here, but I see this as reductionist and against the concept of futurology.  It's totally fair to call out people for thinking we're there now because it's not there now, and there are a lot of issues to fix.  At the same time, if people can't dream of a brighter tomorrow with hope for growth of current tech, what are we even doing here?
