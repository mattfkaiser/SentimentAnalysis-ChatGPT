While I loathe hype, it's a virtual certainty that in almost every area that we touch information, we're going to see a complete transformation, and even within two years might well be unrecognizable. Part of the reason for this is the state at which the technology is, but more importantly, it's awoken the investors of the world who will be creating a deluge of money to make the technology more practical and woven into every aspect of our lives. In other words, the thing that will drive this revolution in many ways will be companies seeking to profit on it. While I do expect to see resistance in most professions, the people with the money aren't going to be swayed.
