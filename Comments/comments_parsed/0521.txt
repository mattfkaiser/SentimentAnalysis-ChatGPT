Like, if you came to me in office hours and asked me these things, I’d tell you to just make sure you don’t use it for fact-checking, but none of this other stuff would bother me — what *would* bother me is that you’re setting me up to downplay AI-generated content in your papers. That makes me suspicious. And if I’m suspicious, I’ll need to give you extra scrutiny, which could backfire. I mean, you could cheat with any tool but I’m already nervous as an instructor about what AI will do for my assignments (synthesizing stuff that’s necessarily in the public domain and has concrete right or wrong answers, I’m still figuring out how to AI-proof it).
