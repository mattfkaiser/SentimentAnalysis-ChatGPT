I've seen people just throw in an inquiry, feel underwhelmed by the response, and just ignored it after that. That's like Googling something and looking at the first link, find that it's not what you were looking for, and then never using Google again, dismissing it as nonsense. In the Google example, we all recognize how ridiculous that is, because it's an established technology that we all have experience with. With ChatGPT, it can be confused with any other chatbot, which it definitely is not. To try and hammer things home, Google immediately reacted when they realized the capabilities of this new tool. It requires a serious threat to make a titan like Google nervous."
"All creativity is derivative. Humans iterate on previous work. An animator studies existing animations to learn and their original work takes in elements of all those they've seen before. ChatGPT is doing the same thing. You're right that it lacks intent, but it doesn't lack creativity. The review of Star Wars you mention is closer to art than a genuine movie review."
