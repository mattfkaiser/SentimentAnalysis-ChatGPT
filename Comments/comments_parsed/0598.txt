Itâ€™s a fun read, especially in light of ChatGPT!"
"Well, I'm not smart, but I had so much more fun reading this thinking it was a true story. Ironically believable having just used ChatGPT for a couple hours. Me googling ""Is \_ a true story or not?"" Then having a good laugh. It kinda gave itself away but I let myself play along. And no, I didn't see you said it was a short story, I stopped reading and clicked the link right at ""Kurt Vonnegut already covered this...""
