Anyway, imo this is a troll post. The time chatGPT takes to generate answers is too long: if you wait that much before answering you just look dumb af."
"I write for a living and use ChatGPT to get a rough draft on the page for some projects. I’ve found that, while I can turn it into something pretty good, the original is fine at best. As such, if you got that job with GPT giving you an assist, then you deserve the job. You’re using a free tool to work better, that’s not a shameful secret. You wouldn’t feel compelled to admit you googled something to understand it better, would you?
