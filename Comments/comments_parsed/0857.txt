My fav way to show this is math. chatGPT can't accurate answer any math equation with enough random digits in it, because its never seen that equation before. It will get 'close' but not precise. (like 34.423423 * 43.8823463 might result in 1,512.8241215 instead of the correct result: 1,510.5805689173849)"
"It's not that it's memorized individual equations, but it doesn't have math ""built into"" it like a computer program would, has a limited memory and attention ability, and runs on tokens so it doesn't even know what numbers are.
