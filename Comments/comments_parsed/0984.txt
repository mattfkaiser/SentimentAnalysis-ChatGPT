There must be studies on how these detectors are not foolproof. Especially when chatgpt is trained on human text, no shit a real human text will look like chatgpt."
"Talked to a few people who actually got hired to read papers for such a thing and there are certain ticks that are able to be noticed in a paper written by chatgpt. Things like the structure of the sentences and such, its not super exact right now but its becoming a thing."
"I saw a story about a woman who was nearly expelled for using ChatGPT for a dissertation until she proved it was using her Master's thesis on the same topic as its source of information, and then had to defend why that wasn't plagiarism."
"I would both be pissed off, and also mildly impressed that my own paper was deemed important enough to be included in ChatGPTs training. Lmao"
Just ask chatgpt to make a history for you
"If you think ChatGPT has invalidated the essay a learning tool, you completely misunderstand what essays are for. The end product is not the point. No highschool or undergrad paper is going to win the Nobel with original research. The point is the *process*. You learn research, communication, and analysis while you're learning about the actual topic."
Who the hell is using chatgpt for papers by directly submitting what it says? It lies half the time
"Honestly, I use chatgpt for essays BUT I never once have copied and pasted anything. Even if I see a sentence I like, I re-word it into my own words. I use it to get ideas flowing and seeing if there’s any points I want to rich in, especially if I’m struggling with getting started in an essay. If you’re using chatgpt and just copying it entirely, you deserve to get caught."
"This is why I stopped taking the essay assignments serious. I remember my freshman and sophomore college years writing elaborate papers just to get a “good job, completed” comment in Canvas.
