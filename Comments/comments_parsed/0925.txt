AI currently cannot think. But with the current pacing it easily could get to that point in a decade or so. Maybe even sooner."

Might be 50 years away or maybe some nerd cracked it last week somewhere in a lab in Palo Alto and he doesn't even know what he has yet because it's still speaking gibberish. What we do know is that multiple major governments are surely working their way there along with Alphabet, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, and a thousand different startups with plenty of capital. Maybe we don't get AGI but we do get something that breaks everyone's brains even more than social media already has. Maybe chatgpt is that language model that breaks everyone's brains. Don't need a troll farm for political division when you can just buy a server farm instead and automate it. I think you're right that we aren't anywhere close to AGI yet but that doesn't mean there isn't some funky shit coming down the pipeline."

It's like saying a computer can't play games because it's just an overgrown calculator."
