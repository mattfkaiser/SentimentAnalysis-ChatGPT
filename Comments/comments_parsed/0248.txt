It’s never even been out of the server room.
If I asked it about art, it would probably give me the skinny on about every art book ever written. Michelangelo. It would know a lot about him. Life’s work. Political aspirations. Him and the Pope. Sexual orientation. The whole works, right? But I bet it can’t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. It’s never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. Seen that.
