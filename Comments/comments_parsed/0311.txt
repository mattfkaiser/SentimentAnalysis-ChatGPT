I asked it what philosophers Cicero read to comfort himself after the death of his daughter Julia. It parroted back the wrong name of his daughter (it was Tullia) and suggested one philosopher who was born 40 years after Cicero died. I said it's unlikely Cicero read his works. It agreed it was ""unlikely."" Isn't unlikely an understatement? It corrected itself to ""highly unlikely."" Well accounting for time travel I guess.
