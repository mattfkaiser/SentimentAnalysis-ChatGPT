One hypothesis is that our experience of the world comes directly from our physical presence in it. More specifically, we can reason that our individual conscious experiences are generated by our brains. This seems to be the most likely case, as we have evidence that all conscious experience is directly correlated to brain activity. Additionally, we donâ€™t have any evidence of souls or spirits or any sort of magical influence. We can leave this irrationality at the door.
