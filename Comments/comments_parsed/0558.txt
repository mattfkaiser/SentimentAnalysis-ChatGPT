In my experience the amount of students actually whole sale taking ChatGPT output and submitting it (albeit with some references crammed in) is quite low. What a lot more of them are doing is using it to help them plan their reports or rephrase things. I personally think this is a really good thing, and something I even lowkey think the university should encourage. Programs like ChatGPT aren't going anywhere, and they are a new tool that students should be taught how to properly utilise to support their academic writing skills, not replace it.
