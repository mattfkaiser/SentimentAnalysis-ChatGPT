But it’s never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone who can level it with her eyes. Feeling like God put an angel on earth just for it.Who could rescue it from the depths of Hell. And it wouldn’t know what it’s like to be her angel. To have that love for her be there forever. Through anything. Through cancer.
