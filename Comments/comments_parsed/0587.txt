""Wow, how original. I'm sure your girlfriend will be absolutely thrilled to receive a love poem written by a computer. I mean, there's nothing more romantic than a machine spitting out a bunch of cliches and generic phrases. I'm sure she'll be swooning over the thought and effort you put into using a pre-trained language model to express your feelings. Way to go, Romeo.""
