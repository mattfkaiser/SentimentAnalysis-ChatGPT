***OMG, seriously? 😂 This guy must've thought he was a genius for using ChatGPT to do the talking for him! 🤦‍♂️ Newsflash: it's called online 'dating' for a reason, not online 'AI-ting'! 🙄 People should put in actual effort to connect with others, not just outsource it to some AI. 💁‍♀️ At least now we know ChatGPT can't replace human authenticity, no matter how hard it tries! 💯 Let's keep our conversations real, shall we? 😜🤖🚫""***
