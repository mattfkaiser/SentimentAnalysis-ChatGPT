“Fake it ‘till you make it” is literally the cornerstone of American capitalism. Don’t ever feel bad for doing what nearly every successful business has done before you."
Use chatgpt to do your job
"So ChatGPT got the job and not you. They will find out very fast that you were full of shit, but you can take the job and either fake it till you make it or get fired and then be back at square one."
Maybe ChatGPT can help you do the job as well.
Just use chat gpt to continue doing your job lol
"I was prepared to do this during a recent interview.  Fortunately I had softball questions and didn't need to use it.  ChatGPT did help with my cover letter to the vice-president, though."
Take the job and just keep ChatGPT bookmarked lol
Just use chatgpt for your job too.
Accept it and use chatGPT to help you learn the job lol
"As a boss, if I found out you used ChatGPT for the interview, I'd say ""naughty naughty... can you teach me how to do that?"" but if I found out you lied on your resume, I'd call HR and ask them how to fire you.
