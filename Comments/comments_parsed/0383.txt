I absolutely use ChatGPT as a search engine. I don't use it for reputable information per se. I would ask it something because I don't know exactly what I'm looking for but only a vague explanation. Then I would ask it one or two more questions and then it gives me something exact to search for. Then I go to google and find the wikipedia page or whatever.
