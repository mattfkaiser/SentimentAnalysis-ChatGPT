For me the usual tell is a combination of the writing style, odd use of references and deviation from the materials we've taught in the module. Most student essays will have a core of content that ks fairly similar- they have been taught the same stuff in the same ways and that foundation will usually be included somewhere. As for references, sometimes it's very obvious that someone has tried to add this to a pregenerated report by chucking terms into Google scholar and citing the first relevant paper.
