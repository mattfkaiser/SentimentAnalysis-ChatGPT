AI detection isn't perfect either. So students are better at technical writing than others that could be considered AI but the difference between ChatGPT and human writing in my experience is the organization and flow of the writing. It's hard to explain but human writing has a natural flow as though it is conversational whereas ChatGPT organizes information in a format that doesn't seem as a natural conversational flow - if that makes sense.
