Chatgpt: No. It just looks like you're pregnant."
ChatGPT outperforms my own family in empathy
"Study finds that chatgpt is good at detecting and producing more empathetic answers, which is was literally written to do"
Instagram algorithms have caused the increase in teenage girl suicides but ChatGPT is what we're worried about?
Itâ€™s not chatgpt that they are worried about
"1. Both are negative, but I honestly worry much more about Artificial Intelligence because it can make several millions of people lose their jobs, spread political misinformation and escalate political tensions, provide false evidence for trials, create automated armies that are more powerful than the human ones, and even erradicate humanity. Your comment seems to me like comparing the invention of the atomic bomb to teenage girls suicides because of instagram. Both are negative, but the atomic bomb is much worse.
2. People can be worried about multiple issues simulaneously. E.g.: Someone can be worried about abortion in the United States, war in Ukraine, climate change, famine in Africa... I don't know why you are (or seem) offended about people worrying about other things too.
3. You say *""ChatGPT is what we're worried about?""*, but the topic of the post was about any or all Artificial Intelligences, not only ChatGPT. I might be wrong, but you seem to be trying to reduce this important concern to the absurd. You seem to be dishonest with your wording. That is like if I said: *""Humanity is in crisis because of AI and you are talking about Instagram""*. That last sentence would be an example of someone being misleading about your concerns."
"Yeah, and who trained the AI.  Not only people, shudder, but basically the collective id, aka the internet.  Not only that, but gross inequity baked in in the form of poor people being exploited (paid $2 an hour to do nothing but absorb the grossest, evilest stuff to try to prevent the AI from being trained by the worst of the worst.)
