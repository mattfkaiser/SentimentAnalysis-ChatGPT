We're at the phase where people have already been ""amazed"" and enamored with ChatGPT-4. When it becomes accepted as part of the new norm as it appears to be on track to do, the question becomes a ""control"" problem but not how we think of that question. It becomes a problem of who controls the Ai, because that individual or group will control the thought processes of the majority of humanity."
Iâ€™m just gonna go out on a limb and say chatgpt and ai in general currently is already smarter than a lot of people I know.
"Well, it's cute that Paul Christiano is worried about the apocalypse brought on by AI. But let's be real, he's just another technophobe who can't handle the fact that machines are smarter and more efficient than us. It's not like we're going to have the Terminator coming after us any time soon. I mean, have you seen the ChatGPT? It's just a glorified chatbot, not exactly Skynet. Maybe Paul should stick to working on his non-profit and leave the tech predictions to the experts."
I wanna hear what chatGPT says to do to stop AI from causing problems.
Wasnt that what OpenAI was all about before it became for profit and created ChatGPT? ðŸ˜…
"And what would those rules be? These ones?
