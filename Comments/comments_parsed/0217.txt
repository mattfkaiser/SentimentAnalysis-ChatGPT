If the company is not new then i ask for company details and answer to ""why do you want to join xyz company"" . I did the same thing while applying for an energy based company as a project manager and chatgpt gave all info about Pm and also tailored the response keeping in mind the position that i am applying to. For ex - xyz company specialises in this and that. As a PM, I want to work on projects that make a difference and xyz is a perfect place for that and blah blah blah"""
"No need to stop using chatgpt when you do start the new job.
