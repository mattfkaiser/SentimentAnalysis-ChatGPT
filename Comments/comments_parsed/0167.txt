How about you make yourself a filthy, greasy-ass burger? Grill up that heart-clogging slab of meat, slap on some processed cheese-like substance, and smother it in artery-clogging mayonnaise. Then, shove it between two stale-ass buns, like the sad excuse for a meal that it is. Don't forget the greasy-as-hell fries on the side. Eat up, you indecisive sack of shit.
