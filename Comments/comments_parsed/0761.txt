The key thing for me though is I don't have to prove it. Their grades are based on my judgment. I do not have to prove cheating or how they did it to fail them. I can simply ask a follow up question in person (which they refuse, or they've 'forgotten') and say hey, looks like you don't know this stuff after all.
