Image 5: The monopolized resources In this dystopian reality, resources are hoarded by a select few, perpetuating scarcity and desperation among the population. The image depicts a barren landscape, stripped of its natural beauty, with vast factories belching toxic fumes into the sky. People are seen scavenging for meager scraps, their faces gaunt and filled with despair. A fortified wall surrounds the few remaining resources, guarded by armed forces, emphasizing the stark divide between those who control and exploit and those who suffer and struggle. This picture embodies a society where the few hold power over critical resources, perpetuating a cycle of deprivation and inequality.
