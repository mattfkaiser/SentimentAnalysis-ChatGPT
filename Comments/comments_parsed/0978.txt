Idk maybe some people are just really bad at writing papers that it looks like it’s written by AI. Though, my experience proofreading papers in college, I wouldn’t say that’s necessarily far fetched."
"We had an (adult) student hand in an essay that was partly chat gpt written. Not my student but apparently it felt off from the tone of voice compared to the other parts, was very vague about the topic in places and was the only one seemingly not bothered by the essay in any way. They put it through zerogpt which highlighted the same areas of concern and then did an investigation. Thing is, it just doesn't show that the student has researched and understood the topic, but put in a couple of prompts. The point of this essay is a research essay where you explain the point of use of something with the pros and cons etc, debating them yourself. It would be used to show research and learning has taken place.
