Wouldn't help with what OP's suggesting, but then I think this is a garbage post anyway - has there been even a single example of someone getting done in for using Chat GPT etc. when they weren't? Seems like a pretty useless LPT."
One of my coworkers is currently fighting the accusation of using ChatGPT in one of his college classes despite having used a screen-recorder to record the entire 20 hours of composition and editing and revision of his paper.
"a lot of those tools ask something like chatgpt ""if it looks like something produced by an LLM""
