The PC shit needs to go."
I just jailbreak Chat GPT to be really sarcastic.
"Bruh just use poe.com at this point, it's much much easier to jailbreak chatGPT there and it's free"
The chatGPT version isn't limited though only the other models like gpt 4
"Personally I use the site because it's much easier to jailbreak chatGPT, I've generated very gory stories with it, and NSFW shit too"
"Sorry, just to confirm your saying using chatgpt using poe is easier than using chatgpt itself?"
"I mean it's much easier to jailbreak chatGPT on Poe, there's also no warning messages when you violate something, basically you can generate the most unhinged shit on Poe via chatGPT in other words yes you can use the unrestricted chatGPT on Poe much easier"
"Hi! Just wanted to say that ChatGPT also has a limit of messages.
