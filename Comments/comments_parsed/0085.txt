""I understand that you're busy and don't have the energy to hold a conversation, but I'm not interested in talking to someone who uses a chatbot. I'm looking for a genuine connection with someone who is interested in getting to know me as a person, not just as a potential date.""
""I'm impressed that you were able to find a way to use ChatGPT to generate conversation, but I'm not interested in talking to someone who isn't actually there. I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a personal level.""
""I appreciate your innovative thinking, but I'm not interested in talking to someone who isn't actually there. I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a personal level.""
