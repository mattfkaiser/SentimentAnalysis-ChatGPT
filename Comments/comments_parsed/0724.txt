Image 1: The oppressive assembly The once-grand assembly hall now stands as a foreboding structure, its architecture stark and imposing. In this image, we see a dimly lit chamber, filled with representatives forced into submission. Their faces display fear and resignation as they engage in forced discussions, their voices muffled and their ideas suppressed. The room is adorned with propaganda posters, reminding them of the consequences of dissent. This image represents a society where the illusion of collective decision-making hides a repressive regime.
