"If ChatGPT helped you get the job, it may also help you keep it."
Use chatgpt for your job too. Win win
Plot twist: This is actually a fake story you asked ChatGPT to write for you
Iâ€™m gonna call BS on this lol. Chat GPT takes a little to generate a response and types slowly. Youâ€™d be answering the questions REALLY slowly which would be a major red flag to the interviewer. PLUS youâ€™d be reading from the screen which is obvious and something interviewers look for.
This is total BS. Expect it to show up on right wing blog sites as an example of the /r/antiwork crowd scamming employers using ChatGPT.
"Once I figure ChatGPT out, can we use each other as references? I am hoping to transition to another higher paying job so I can pay my bills and survive.
