All that to say, I write my own papers, and I’m a cranky middle aged guy who isn’t gonna “prove version history”. Then again, I also pay for MS Office. One last thing though: getting a degree is a fine balance between “I have a piece of paper that says I can make more money” and “I actually learned something that I can use to make myself more effective and competitive”. Obviously, the deadlines and large amount of work make the latter a little more difficult, so sometimes you just need to do the minimal effort to pass; sometimes it benefits to learn just a little more."
