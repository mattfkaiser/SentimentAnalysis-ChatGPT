If you decide to come clean, it's essential to be upfront with the employer and take responsibility for your actions. Apologize for any misrepresentations on your resume and during the interview, and explain that you genuinely want to learn and grow in the position. While there may be consequences, honesty and integrity are crucial in building trust and maintaining a positive reputation in your career.
