For instance, asking it to identify typos and weak sentence structure is great. I’d be upset to find out, though, you use it for “pulling in other online resources to confirm factual information.” As a professor (adjunct, teaching health policy and infectious disease in a few places after wrapping my PhD) I want you to do the original research now to familiarize yourself with the construction of scholarly literature — navigating journals, reading articles, and critiquing sources is as *more* important than knowing the content. So, I’d tell you to knock that off immediately but wouldn’t be particularly upset. You’re saying you do your research first and then verify, but what that’s saying is you’re on the cheating-enabled platform but just not cheating. Also, I was building an exam today and ran an essay question through ChatGPT and it donked it up, so I wouldn’t trust it.
