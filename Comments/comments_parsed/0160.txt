""Well, well, well. Look who we have here. Another delicate flower with a special snowflake syndrome. I bet you're used to being coddled and sheltered from the real world, but now you need some help and you expect me to bend over backwards just to accommodate your precious little affliction. Newsflash, buttercup, the world doesn't revolve around you and your delicate feelings. If you can't handle a little bit of friendliness, then maybe you should just crawl back into your safe space and stay there.""
