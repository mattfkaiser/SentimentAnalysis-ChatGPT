ChatGPT knows even less than that."
"I love how ChatGPT has ignited this fear of what things ChatGPT may be at risk of taking away from us in terms of capability and reasoning and intelligence. Many people feel threatened. I don't. ChatGPT is brilliant, and will change the world along with platforms like it. I've always felt that humans are basically just biological robots operating according to the laws of physics, learning patterns and predicting things with neural nets. Let these azong tools make us question what it means to be intelligent. Let it challenge our existential fears. These are important topics for humanity to consider sooner rather than later."
"Yep, the excitement over ChatGPT isn't because of what it currently is, rather that it gives a glimpse at the future potential of AI and that it isn't that far away. It reminds me about how people dismissed videogames in the 80's or the internet in the 90's because they focused on what it was instead of what it had the potential to be."
"This exactly. When you ask ChatGPT about subjects you know very well you'll find it is often wrong or at the very least unable to make definite statements. It is however often right and once in a while will produce something that's actually very insightful.
