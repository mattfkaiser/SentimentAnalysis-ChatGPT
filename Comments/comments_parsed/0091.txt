""So you're too lazy to even hold a conversation with a real person? That's pathetic. I'm not interested in talking to a chatbot, so please don't waste my time. I'm looking for someone who can actually hold a conversation and connect with me on a personal level. If you're not that person, then I suggest you move on.""
