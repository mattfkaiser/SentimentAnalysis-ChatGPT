Let's say it is possible to boil down all the functions of a single neuron into a list of simple instructions. I don't think it is a stretch to say that nothing magical goes on at a cellular level, and that with enough time, all of these functions could be performed by a single person (receiving a message, sending a message, etc.). Then, we get 86 billion other people together in one giant room, each of them performing the role of one neuron. Assuming you had access to a snapshot of an individual person's brain, a perfect map of every existing neural connection, you could assign those connections to your neuron simulators. This is the ultimate extrapolation of the Chinese Room Experiment, and it demonstrates that the scenario described is not functionally removed from the reality of concious thought-- that it is inherently built on the actions of unknowing, unthinking constituent parts.
