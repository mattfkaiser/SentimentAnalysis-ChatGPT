I call on all of the
holy powers,
Great and small,
The children of Heimdall;
I want, O Father of the Slain,
To ask for the
life of Aurvandil,
The wolf
and the serpent,
Before the Völva.
One and eight,
Until the three of Aegir,
Ten and count Two
great winters,
The men themselves
About the destiny
of the son of Hefnd.
Last, the Sun-tally
Will count the suns,
Nor will the Ruler of Men
Ever become the Beloved."

Was this written by ChatGPT tho?
