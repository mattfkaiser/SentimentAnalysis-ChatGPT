Can confirm that this is exploratory on the part of the teacher; the only way I’d press the student beyond a conversation would be if they were clearly being deceptive or manipulative, like claiming to not know what ChatGPT is."
"As someone who just found out that Chat GPT was a thing around a month ago, I don't see how it would be inherently deceptive or manipulative to say they don't know about it. But this post itself does seem quite polite and exploratory rather than accusatory."
"Don't worry m8 not everyone has heard of it yet. It has been on the news a little bit, but not everyone pays attention to the news or stays updated with technology. I know people who have heard of the name ChatGPT but haven't looked into what it was until I showed them"
"It’s not inherently deceptive to say you don’t know if you really don’t know, that’s not what they’re trying to say. OP clearly knows about ChatGPT already so it would be deceptive and manipulative for them to claim they don’t know what it is."
"Are you a highschool or college student? If so I'd be very sus that you didn't know what ChatGPT is.
