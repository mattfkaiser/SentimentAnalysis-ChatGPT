I also understand that much of this conversation is like talking about a zombie apocalypse.  We don't talk about the zombie apocalypse because we think zombies will destroy society.  We talk about it because it doesn't quite matter what destroys society, it's an engine for the discussion of ethics in a collapsed society.
