I was taught to always presume innocence until proven guilty. I had this very same conversation less than a month ago with a college student. I open conversations about cheating by asking, ""Tell me about your process in writing/doing this assignment."" I WANT to hear how they did it. If you can believe this, we professors are humans with feelings too, and it stinks to file academic misconduct reports. Most of us are in this profession because we love learning and sharing knowledge with others, not to catch students red handed.
