>What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character.
