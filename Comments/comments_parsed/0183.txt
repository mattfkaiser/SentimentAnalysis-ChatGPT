Bask in the radiance that your communication and interaction has been successful lol..."
Just keep using chatGPT in your job too lmao.
Just keep using chatgpt at your new job ðŸ˜‚
I say accept it. I would say most of if not all of us get impostor syndrome from new jobs. But be warned not sure what job you got but you will get found out if it's probably a technical job where you don't have skill. Chat gpt can only get you so far with programming for example. I've noticed that it can generate simple codes but advance stuff it generates something that looks right but is wrong like adding parameters that don't exist to functions. Fake it till you make it though congrats on the job
"Then no one should ever take any job because one of the other candidates might be more qualified or more in need.
