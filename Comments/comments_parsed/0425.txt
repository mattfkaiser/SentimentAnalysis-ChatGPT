ChatGPT gets right to the details of my inquiry, and provides case-specific examples. Is it perfect? Of course not, but the Google results is infinitely less perfect or capable, yet it's an accepted source of knowledge and information. What's even more important, I can chain my inquiries into refining the solution, and I can ask for explanations on specific elements I'm looking into. Again, does it provide the perfect answer to everything? No. But I can see by testing the results, how accurate the answers are. Because my code doesn't work if the answer is wrong or incomplete. Additionally, incorrect answers isn't even a reason to throw away the inquiry. With Google, if I get no sufficient answers, I'd usually try changing and refining my keywords. I do the same with ChatGPT, but because it retains the context, I can simply refine on the initial inquiry, refining its answers.
