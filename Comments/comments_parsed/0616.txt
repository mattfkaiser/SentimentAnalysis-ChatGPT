As for Tinder automation - well….here’s the thing. I think Tinder is extremely inefficient. You spend hours mindlessly swiping. Only to be matched with randos who are 90% not going to be a good match, have long awkward conversations with them to learn that fact, and have to deal with the ridiculous amount of competition/selectivity on the app. I met a few girls off of Tinder in real life. Because, hey I didn’t have any better options. They were even less of a match in person.
