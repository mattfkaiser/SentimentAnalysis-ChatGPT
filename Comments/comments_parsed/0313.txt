Yessss. ChatGPT has been awesome as a tool to help flesh out worlds and stories in my D&D campaigns.
"Does this actually work? I've tried using ChatGPT to generate story ideas (for fanfiction, not real novels) and it always gives me the most bog standard generic pitches that are never better than my own. I'll admit it's a good starting point in that it actually writes instead of just sitting there staring at a blank screen, but it's never once given me anything actually creatively inspiring."
This is the way.  ChatGPT is the first technology that has actually amazed me since the dawn of the web.  I have been using it as a tool to help me better learn how to write PowerShell scripts.  It is like having an expert on hand who can  instantly guide me in the right direction without wasting a lot of time sorting through Google search results and irrelevant posts on Stackoverflow.    That being said it has sometimes given me bad advice and incorrect answers.  It is a great tool and I get the hype but people need to temper their expectations.
