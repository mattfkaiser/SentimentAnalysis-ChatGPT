My instructor showed me chatGPT earlier this week. At first I was really impressed and wanted to test itâ€™s abilities with some simple cshtml I wrote. It got so much wrong that it was basically unusable for anything other than having it explain what a code snippet or block does if u donâ€™t want to bother googling it.
