ChatGPT in particular is no more than a conversational AI. The only reason it's trained on so many topics is so that it can uphold conversations, no matter the subject. It's abysmal at consistency on more abstract concepts, and will often change its answer just because you say it's wrong. It has a host of limitations, and honestly I wouldn't trust it with anything more that writing emails. I've even gone back to Stackoverflow to find my answers.
