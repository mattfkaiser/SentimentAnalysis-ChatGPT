Go ahead and run your financial life exclusively through ChatGPT. Since you don't understand the ChatGPT-generated algos you're plugging into client code, it's only fair that you not exert any control over ChatGPT's decisions about your money other than issuing commands directly to ChatGPT.

Are you going to risk your own money in such a scheme? Do you think it'd be wise to risk your client's/employer's money?

No one knows where this is all going. We still don't have self-driving cars. We still need translators when things *have* to be right. Maybe there will be some breakthrough in AGI, but at that point, all white collar work is going to change, not just those related to programming. 

Who knows? Why bother worrying?
